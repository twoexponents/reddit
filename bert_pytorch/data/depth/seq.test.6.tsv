t1_du25wal	1	*	Nobody complained about the men being punished because woman. Why so misogynist?
t1_dtarxmp	0	*	Keeping Bombardier around is all about jobs, votes, and taxes.  Bombardier does very little work in the national defense arena anymore.
t1_dtaokgx	1	*	It's not just a government funded work program, it's also about R&D and knowhow.   Having the domestic expertise to build commercial aircraft is worth a lot.

t1_dund44w	1	*	It's a shit example, because it's 1) the same for almost every state 2) has nothing to do with corruption.
t1_dumvbeb	1	*	Yep. The same skulduggery is commonplace in Westminster as well. Mainstream media almost never report on it.
t1_dumg6gf	0	*	>  rich people have less of an incentive to accept corruption.  I am not so sure

t1_dsm6za0	1	*	Well, Finland is a joke.

t1_dtvrulu	1	*	The fact that they have held out so much so far says a lot.  
t1_ds320jg	0	*	Right answer. We drop funding, we lose what leverage we do have. At least eith the cash, the ISI pays us lip service. It's the least shitty of a bunch of shitty options.

t1_dstba34	0	*	Yeah, while the Palestinian Authority controls construction in Areas A and B, not allowing any Israeli construction. They don't even allow people to sell land to Jews. It's punishable by death.

t1_duti8vm	0	*	We see how well herd immunity is working on the flu. It sounds like it worked better when people just got the disease if infection rates are only going up.
t1_dutgrec	1	*	The same logic never applies to immigrants. Literally. A country's constitution largely provides the strongest protections for its citizens, and fewer if any protections for anyone else.
t1_dutqwj1	0	*	God ordered the killings of a lot of people though. Not a very useful command if you constantly violate your own orders.
t1_duth4qh	0	*	Any sources on this?

t1_dutu6vj	1	*	Drug companies are way too worried about their antidepressants and boner pills to worry all that much about the whopping 2% of their revenue they derive from vaccinations.

t1_dutt10b	0	*	Isnt this actually just a side effect of lots of immigration from a part of the world where they dont vaccinate as much? How deep in this thread does one have to go to find that argument?
t1_dutla0g	1	*	no, but what is the percentage? 20% of them are like that? 30? 50?
t1_dum9fpk	1	*	Oh thank you. If you think about it that is quite an honor.

t1_dv5if2x	1	*	That's why people buy porn, or steal magazines 
t1_dv4bygy	1	*	There's no need to be condescending. You could've at least asked for elaboration.
t1_dv59v64	1	*	Do you believe you should be able to sell yourself into slavery?
t1_dv4esvk	0	*	Because the original meaning of first, second and third world aren't the same as today's meaning. As matter of fact second world has no meaning anymore, only first and third have it nowadays.

t1_dv4gt5i	1	*	And it covers the whole EU!

t1_dv4f08q	0	*	Isnt that something you can actually sue over? Blatant misleading and false advertising. 
t1_dv4ctt1	0	*	Well, they're selling a big mac. Not up to a big mac. So yes, that'd be a big problem. ISPs are scummy at times, so I just harass them until I receive what I pay for. Constantly. It worked last time.

t1_dv48ee3	0	*	y'all just ripped off Shakespeare
t1_dv4k0aj	0	*	If you can use it no matter your data usage, thats unlimited. Throttling doesnt mean its not unlimited. Just means the speed isnt unlimited. .
t1_dv69k1q	0	*	Still a lie in my book
t1_dv492us	0	*	Well theoretically with that down speed you'd be able to hit 1.0584TB in a day so obviously you're just not trying hard enough.  Maybe /r/DataHoarder has some ideas for you :)

t1_ds55bk2	0	*	I agree, just curious about the specific situation.  If your job responsibilities grew, why didn't your salary grow with it?  Had you asked for more compensation before you found the discrepancy?
t1_ds5c8b0	0	*	This is probably obvious but isn't this part of the problem, time on the job equals skills and experience and there aren't many men staying home having babies.

t1_dseto28	0	*	That is what the company claims because it would mean they committed no crime. The evidence isn't in their favor.
t1_dsgjmw0	1	*	> Legally, thats plenty.   In the EU, probably not. Important information has to be explicitly stated, not tucked away in notes somewhere.
t1_dsfcn51	1	*	I already cant understand droid, lets not make it worse.
t1_dsewq3c	0	*	there is no crime here because apple said so   Come on man, you're better than this. The prosecutors would know a lot better than you if a crime had been committed under french law.

t1_dtau0lw	0	*	Naive that a sovereign nation can craft its own laws?
t1_dtbjcse	1	*	Indeed. I remember all the backlash that went to Fox because of that. And in a way, it's sad to realize that the sovereignty of one country depends to a large extent on the other.

t1_ds3ou48	1	*	I dont know if Russia can pull off another election like they did last time. 
t1_ds3l69y	1	*	At this point in his presidency Obama had a net approval of +5. Trump is currently at -18
t1_dsgr834	1	*	I applaud your commendable retort. It's nice when people actually provide citation rather than backtracking.
t1_du8hb71	1	*	There is one already, people getting robbed of their kidneys is daily practice in many third world countries.  This system is to prevent this being Capitalised on. It's not a business...
t1_du8kej1	1	*	I don't, i'd be dead so why would i?
t1_du8oyyj	1	*	That would make a murderer happy.  I refuse to let you conduct an autopsy on my husband!  *eyes narrow, grins to herself as she has committed the perfect crime*
t1_duceaij	1	*	Actually I have made special arrangements for all my clothes & stuff to be stored in a box in a warehouse indefinitely. Sorry... /s
t1_du934bf	1	*	 But then it doesn't really matter if you're a donor or not... with enough money you can just get disappeared easily. 
t1_dua9c3k	1	*	I cannot speak for Israel. The system doesnt allow for that in the US, where I work. 
t1_du9afpk	1	*	Everyone in Texas is Hank Hill.
t1_du8ljza	0	*	Some of your organs can still be used. Smoking doesn't ruin every organ in your body.
t1_due9z49	0	*	I was agreeing lol! 
t1_du8rhn9	0	*	It's not their body once they die.   Even if you believe in an afterlife - there are no bodies as we know them.
t1_du8t2ij	0	*	Which is why if you choose not to be an organ donor and preserve the dignity of your remains, you don't get to have priority over someone else's organs, should you need one. Fair is fair. 
t1_du8rnyp	0	*	But then again, I'm not a doctor...
t1_du92z3c	1	*	> Becoming a donor is a hassle and people are lazy.   Where do you live? In the US, in every state I've lived in, it's as simple as checking a box on driver license paperwork.
t1_du8uazl	1	*	I'll acknowledge it, but I certainly don't have to respect it.  Edit: Ah, I see we're placing the make believe on a higher pedestal than helping to save human lives.  Got it.
t1_du8g7jn	1	*	EMTs don't even have time to check your medical jewelery most of the time, so unless some Good Samaritan is digging through your wallet and telling them what is on the card, it's a non starter.

t1_du8icnr	0	*	Is it possible for you to get off your high horse and be civilised in discussing matters?  Thanks!
t1_du8ej3a	1	*	...Doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing?  If you want to donate your organs, you can, and if you don't want to, you can opt out and no one will touch you. Where's the problem here?
t1_du8evyv	0	*	But the organs are not harvested from the dead. Only non-functional brains. The heart has to be still beating for them to be harvested. 
t1_ducg50j	1	*	I don't care what happens to my body after all my organs are removed.  They can throw it in the trash or feed it to dogs for all I care.    I don't know why you assume I'd want to be buried.

t1_du9hw8a	1	*	Admittedly we do know rich people can and will game the system but you're right, there most definitely isn't some global conspiracy of doctors letting poor people die so the rich can get their organs.
t1_du8hs4n	0	*	to NL from US, on average :P
t1_du9fwnm	0	*	So in a country with an 'opt in' system do you think they're killing off people who have opted to donate to harvest their organs?   If you're that worried just opt out. 
t1_du8tsfp	0	*	I know you might not have an answer as some people are just kind of irrationally uncomfortable with the idea, but why don't you want to be an organ donor?
t1_du8juae	0	*	That doesn't seem in any way relevant to the topic at hand.
t1_du8ox5v	1	*	Its all for the greater good
t1_du8m5g2	0	*	Paying taxes online has been a thing for like 15 years here in Northern Europe
t1_du8m7o0	0	*	Then they'll code them if they're a full code. Your doctor and nursing team don't even have anything to do with the donation staff. They're a different entity 
t1_ducdsql	0	*	Not irrelevant. You said to apply that logic to other aspects of life. I did, and gave a scenario where that already happens. 
t1_du8cigj	1	*	They do get a last word, however they need to have substantial reasons to go against the deceased wishes in order to make a change.
t1_du8s1kz	1	*	They don't want your lungs. They do want both of your kidneys. Please sign up. You can do it online.
t1_du8rr29	1	*	But, but...  There's still noises coming from you...
t1_du8hek1	1	*	Depends where you are and what doctor/hospital/judge/etc. you end up trying to convince, but that is often the case.
t1_du8dm2t	0	*	No it doesn't.  It's purely an empirical question.
t1_du8m36u	1	*	And here you can see on display, donated by his loving family, the liver of Mr. Yui_tsukino, who killed himself in a still unexplained week long binge of Vodka and Tylenol.
t1_du8z5jt	1	*	I think I have seen this anime. 
t1_du8nwx3	1	*	Even if your organs aren't viable for transplants, they can still be used for scientific research.
t1_du926l3	1	*	I work in a cardiac OR doing transplants. We take smoker's lungs quite often. It doesn't preclude them from being a donor.
t1_du8g3qx	1	*	You know they would review your medical records first, right?
t1_du8ibro	1	*	To be honest they didn't even understand the concern when they replied. I wouldn't count on an insightful answer.
t1_du8wyjx	1	*	Sounds like people in your family are killing other people in your family and getting away with it.  They also don't think on their feet quickly when asked to give a reason why.

t1_du0guhl	1	*	I remember when that card was only 800 and it was still too expensive for me haha
t1_dtp386d	1	*	Yep. All this does is provide more information to the consumer about who is backing this video. Whether it be PBS, RT, Al Jazeera or WashPo. 
t1_dtpgrbu	1	*	You'd made a much more salient point without your last two sentences. Most people see that stuff and interpret it like a neon sign to just disregard everything you say completely..
t1_dtp6zfa	0	*	Yes this is true, that doesn't mean china doesn't sponsor propaganda outside of the 50 cent party. That was just an example of something that's well known.

t1_dulywo1	1	*	A lapdance is so much better when the stripper is crying
t1_dul2iph	1	*	It's very dated usage. Old British gentleman would speak in this way.
t1_dulakbx	1	*	The MPs are getting high and fucking koalas before two in the afternoon all on the tax payer's doubloon. 
t1_dulju42	1	*	Holy shit that is amazing.
t1_dulk9ll	1	*	> they aren't stripping down ALL the way.  god damnit
t1_dull37i	1	*	I'm aware that in some asian countries people will hire boyfriends/girlfriends to attend events, but strippers?  
t1_dum2vvn	1	*	**Don't worry they say:**  > ...it is a way of showing respect to the dead...
t1_dsphh34	1	*	Only when they're going back.
t1_duirrn3	1	*	And it went straight over my head!
t1_dt8npfj	0	*	You put your wheat in there.
t1_dt8qvn7	1	*	Any time.
t1_dt8nq7q	0	*	You put your wheat in there.
t1_dum7ug1	0	*	But It could go back that way If the government,puts back a hard boarder up. Though I think It might not be as bad as before.
t1_dulhtv7	1	*	Its really just applying to the present a basic analysis on how human progress was achieved in the past.
t1_dulkwzj	1	*	>Also, thanks for your suggestion but unfortunately I DO know some bits about apartheid (or segregation).  I guess you know this from being the priviledged ethnicity/race
t1_dskp1vh	0	*	Always in what possible reality? What state of total historical ignorance could lead to a nonsense statement like that?
t1_dsksd6z	0	*	What conclusion are you trying to draw here? Democrats bad, Republicans good?
t1_dsl14ma	1	*	Ah, the good ol' Schroedinger's minority.
t1_dsl3gqh	1	*	More like Nimrod.
t1_dskramm	1	*	What makes you think Americans want to come to shithole Europe?
t1_dskrbcr	0	*	Sounds legit.  Def not way, way more complicated than that.
t1_dsktlmn	1	*	You know how hard it is to get a visa in the EU from the US?   
t1_dskv9p5	0	*	I have been to Toronto.  Besides the riots over hockey, it was pretty similar.  Besides all the white people I mean.
t1_dskuoqp	1	*	> But if the Democratic party would accept and listen to us rather than continue pointing fingers maybe we could have some actual conversations.  Accept you for what, and listen to what?
t1_dskqt2y	1	*	Can confirm. Grandmother lived in Nazi Norway.
t1_dskoou1	1	*	If you can deny what he is saying then I would be surprised. 
t1_dskquv3	1	*	We have enough unskilled farm labor already, thanks. This isn't the 19th century either and the country is getting crowded. 
t1_dsknvin	0	*	>what most Americans think privately on the world stage  Wrong
t1_dskklit	1	*	Mmhmm, if you say so mate. 
t1_dskr7xh	1	*	I mean, most people would agree that Haiti is in fact a total shithole country, because it absolutely is. That's not the issue here. 
t1_dsksjgy	1	*	I doubt he considers his grandfather.  FTFY.
t1_dskx87k	0	*	Its been over 3 hours and still no source. The only source he has is up his ass and out his mouth
t1_dsxew6y	0	*	No instead they make the employer pay you more money, and have gotten us basic labour protections, but hey fuck the 40 hour work week and overtime right?
t1_dsy6jrt	1	*	Not Heinz??  (Site of third grade field trip)
t1_dsz5e94	1	*	It's more complicated than that.  Other people make wage!  Spend HERE!
t1_dsyaabu	1	*	I use to love BK too. It's easily the worse chain for standards around here and their burgers taste dry 
t1_dsy21td	0	*	Is there an actual definition for artisanal bread?
t1_dsxkky6	1	*	Same, haven't been to a BK in years once their quality drop became uniform among locations.  The last time I gave them a chance was around 2013.  
t1_dsyashc	0	*	If the employee keeps his opinions to himself then he has nothing to worry. If the employee decides to exercise his 1st amendment like a boss then he should have a lawyer on retainer.
t1_dsxz34x	1	*	I know burger king was too good to be true!
t1_dsxriz5	1	*	That explain everything. 
t1_dsy5ihe	0	*	Yes I have. I am happy to see such companies flail. I give more of a shit about working people than I do about badly run corporations.  
t1_dsy90no	1	*	No supply side economics definitely works. See china in 1992. Problem is most people just expect the wrong benefits from it.
t1_dt8x2n9	0	*	Found the conservative canadian, to think conservativescare more about the poor is a joke, you are clearly lying to push your conservative agenda
t1_dt8wy9v	0	*	Thats literally what a threat is, it's if you do this, I'll do that, aka a threat
t1_dsxd4m2	0	*	See, when unions do it, it's not an implicit threat.
t1_dsyrqxi	0	*	Ummm Wendys owned Tim Hortons from 1992 to 1996 when Tim Hortons went public...
t1_dsxo93h	0	*	I really never understood the obsession, just assumed it meant there just weren't any other options in Canada so you all just assumed that was good coffee. Its not.
t1_dsycd6b	1	*	I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground before I clean up my chemicals throughout Colombia.
t1_dsyjvzy	1	*	Ive never seen a good source on that. As far as I know thats just a popular myth.
t1_dsxndvo	1	*	The average store brings in 5-10k a day. Assuming only a 5% profit margin thats 100-200k a year.
t1_dsyb3g7	1	*	That number is from Tim Horton and assumes average 35 FTE at each location, I dont think thats very reasonable assumption.  
t1_dsy0e99	1	*	Your asking Canadians to ban Tim Hortons, Kraft, and Heinz? Whats next? Beer?
t1_dsxy31n	1	*	Yeah ik there regular coffee is good but the espresso drinks pleasantly surprised me.  Stacks up to my shop and most other chain coffee shops!
t1_dsxtsms	0	*	I'll just leave [this](https://i.imgur.com/FMPYvzN.gifv) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/7OUpG5G.gifv) here.
t1_dsxptqa	0	*	Better cut their taxes some more
t1_dsxhpl9	0	*	Wrong country. We're not America and we don't demonize unions, one of the many reasons your country is going to shit and we aren't.
t1_dsym789	1	*	Kind of, except Labatt is Belgian. Owned by what's now owned by Anheuser-Busch since like 1995.
t1_dsz4o3f	1	*	That's the thing, I never said it had the best.  Just better than Tim's.   
t1_dsyfi0e	1	*	-Thinks that one person owns 4,600 franchise locations -is not simple minded Pick one Cheers buddy, you arent the only one drinking tonight
t1_dsxx13t	1	*	all minimum wage increases lead to higher rates of unemployment. Government attempts to set the minimum wage that is most beneficial for the well being of society.
t1_dsqr22c	0	*	Don't get me wrong, I think Trudeau is the best Canada is going to get in terms of politicians, but he's turning us into Trump's lapdog. 
t1_dtsyry0	1	*	It's the one that likes to sign stuff without considering any repercussions.
t1_dtsm8wi	1	*	We really need to just start calling them god-emperors. The pretense is getting annoying. 
t1_dt68bdm	1	*	Wow very edge. Much badass
t1_dt5xlf3	0	*	Gold consumption is 50% jewellery, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry. It's usefulness is overstated.
t1_dtn9fox	0	*	Yes. 
t1_dtnblwu	1	*	The conditions that led to the rise of hatred need addressed not those feeling the hatred. If you ignore them and try to silence them you only concentrate the feeling. 
t1_dthch88	1	*	Middle and senior managers, ultimately to a person in government responsible for it.
t1_du0cl50	0	*	That's assuming doing that accomplishes anything and that the US will actually stop funding terrorist groups going forward.
t1_du0rizf	1	*	And your point is..?
t1_ds3ui79	1	*	Just got back from visiting my brother in rural Rwanda. It's not scary.
t1_ds3glr2	0	*	Collaborate and listen.
t1_ds3q30z	1	*	The place they bought it from wasn't also the government was it? That's why it's capitalism.
t1_ds3j7k1	1	*	Ring a Drone-Ding !
t1_ds3q6lr	1	*	This technology was driven to cheap prices due to millions of free market RC hobbyists.
t1_ds3nhdr	1	*	Standard DJI drones can get a couple miles up, so I think the main issue is the other air traffic that you brought up.
t1_dsos6z2	1	*	it's all cms my dude  never be shy about cms  We could cheat..and say it in ms....
t1_dsohhta	1	*	Skipping a meal, however, is much more likely to break your discipline
t1_du352dh	0	*	In the Redditverse where self-driving electric cars fill the street and are charged by 100% green energy. Where the oil industry has crumbled into near nothingness. In other words, fantasyland.
t1_dv14q0b	0	*	Was that after WW1, they divided up the territories and didn't pay much attention to local politics right?
t1_dv1r9cx	0	*	I get gigabit in a small city in southern Ontario. It's fantastic. Unlimited bandwidth, too.
t1_dtvn91d	0	*	False dilemma really. 
t1_dtwbhmf	0	*	When it's cannibalizing it's young and preventing its pride from repopulating.   Ffs do you not know how to look these things up yourself?
t1_dtvn5ll	1	*	So they deserve to be shunned and have death threats sent to their family? 
t1_dtvmnyy	0	*	Replace cat with homeless people and you'll see why some of us have a problem with this situation.
t1_dtvdngj	1	*	No otherwise we wouldn't need these hunts... 
t1_dtvklfm	0	*	Guess it depends on how you value life, and which lives you believe to be above others.
t1_dtw0pot	0	*	Dogs have had a symbiotic relationship with humans for thousands of years, pigs haven't, and bacon is fucking delicious. Also I don't like factory farming either
t1_dtvyqlm	0	*	Nah. You can grip weapons in other ways. Have you played Hand Simulator?
t1_dtvrksz	0	*	He is saying that neither is.
t1_dtvewsn	0	*	It's pretty much my hobby, yeah. Sad, I know.
t1_dtvn7ic	1	*	Boy could drown me a lot easier by accident, leaving us both dead. Why would I risk myself for some idiot who cant swim? Plus that dogs gonna be fine. 
t1_dtvgplc	0	*	(that's kinda my point)
t1_dtvra6s	1	*	 You're goddamn right
t1_dtvfnud	1	*	what? Is this actually a thing? Then what's the point?!  Thanks, now I'm furious! 
t1_dtvu99f	1	*	I agree with you. Many of these animals that are hunted are either old or Violent towards their own species. 
t1_dtvh4bf	1	*	But that's what this hunter did. We aren't talking about licenced conservation killing. We are talking about captive animals being brought into an enclosure and shot.
t1_dtvij3s	1	*	When did it need to be an accomplishment? 
t1_dtvt0j7	1	*	Blood for the Blood God!! 
t1_dtvh28g	0	*	Head on over to r/watchpeopledie and search for the video of ISIS children hunting dudes and killing them in a bombed out building. 
t1_dtvehqn	0	*	That would be really cool to see, I've seen scans/models of that kind of stuff but never a proper plastination, it'd be fascinating to see with my own eyes
t1_dtvrym5	0	*	Having priorities and values isn't a negative thing. You're acting like trophy hunting doesn't help the species in the long term, or maybe you don't know that.
t1_dtvhkww	1	*	You are bad at logic.  False equivalencies are literally one of the first things you learn about in intro to philosophy.
t1_dtveika	0	*	That's because they have diamonds 
t1_dtw226f	1	*	redacted
t1_dtvh4ma	0	*	> I don't personally eat them, so therefore no one in the world does ever. fact!
t1_dtwhnim	1	*	Nothing really justified. But its Karma. Hes a piece of shit. 
t1_dtviygx	1	*	Neither are captive bred lions...
t1_dtvy4vy	0	*	So instead of rape they should be allowed to put down the infertile women?
t1_dtvh709	1	*	*Hunters put more money than you ever would towards canned hunts
t1_dtv7ve2	0	*	Tell that to the hunting game farms in Texas with African animals.
t1_dtvrbeb	1	*	uhhh, yeah, your comparison is completely shit
t1_dtxeep3	0	*	That animals don't have as much value to humans as humans do. Are you suggesting we let animals get drivers licenses and vote in the midterms?
t1_dtvaps9	0	*	Just to be clear- you think these cullings involve killing every last one of them?
t1_dtv9hm0	1	*	Yeah I'm sure everyone on here defending the practice is dropping 100k to fly to Africa to hunt bro 
t1_dtvl9m4	0	*	So nothing useful. Your job will be replaced by automation soon. 
t1_dtvrahe	1	*	We'll gag and hogtie a shaved carrot top.
t1_dtvpuw9	1	*	That is very hypocritical
t1_dtvlw2p	1	*	No they are not different . They are a human being involved in a hunting accident. Same loss of life.
t1_dtvkqwh	0	*	While I don't doubt that it happened who are these mysterious death threat people. I've always wondered.
t1_dtvlg16	1	*	> they would threaten to hunt him like he was an animal  now that's funny in an ironic way. :-)  
t1_dtvgck0	0	*	Well then I think my ramblings were entirely out of place, apologies.
t1_dtxc9mg	1	*	Nope.
t1_dtvr8ut	1	*	What have you donated to conserving the lion population?
t1_dtvfntj	1	*	Move over in that lead lined basket.
t1_dtvg1qp	1	*	With regards for the animals and the effects it has on our planet ( pretty relevant these days) kinda 
t1_dtvbo6h	0	*	If they were doing it to themselves and hunting would stop it then again, yeah maybe. You know any indigenous tribes where a single adult is threatening the entire population?
t1_dtwg3ae	1	*	Why though? You can sustain yourself on a vegetarian diet perfectly fine with no health issues so raising and killing meat for your taste is purely for fun.
t1_dtvh7d6	0	*	no.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c
t1_dtvk2kn	1	*	Because nobody does lol
t1_dtvhkur	1	*	The irony is, this happens to us all (if we are lucky).
t1_dtwjspo	0	*	You had had chickens as parents? 
t1_dtxdwj8	1	*	Humans are more important because they're a dominant species? 
t1_dtv8ngp	1	*	Kinda, but everyone does it so its not that impressive.
t1_dtvktid	1	*	you watched it till the end tho? i find it a rather informative and good video.
t1_dtwppht	1	*	If being the key word.
t1_dtve3e7	1	*	SO BE IT!
t1_dtx88dj	0	*	Are you not? Scale is important
t1_dtvxohy	0	*	Puffin and horse were a surprise to me, but they were really tasty too. I'm glad I sampled them. 
t1_dtvxhqp	1	*	Nope, if someone I love and respect started doing it, I'd just disown them
t1_dtwae2h	0	*	Closer inspection huh? You've gone and checked this out personally?
t1_dtveqsp	1	*	They aren't conversationists. The people they pay so that they can get a no effort free kill are conversationists. These are just spoiled cunts that get pleasure from causing death.
t1_dtvkocn	1	*	Funny, that's kind of how health insurance works.
t1_dtv9gp0	0	*	im not sure why you're looking for a debate. you asked me why people are acting a certain way, and I told you why people are acting a certain way. 
t1_dtvkyo4	1	*	And the inverse of America
t1_dtw9706	0	*	I like how you assume to know about my education and automatically ruled me out as stupid or wrong.
t1_dtvrjq2	0	*	oh fuck off
t1_dtvqjlb	1	*	Yes.  More sporting, more skill, more risk, more excitement for the nimrods.
t1_dtvo6p8	1	*	It sounds like your chicken masters treated you well. Did you buy your freedom with a handful of corn?
t1_dtvecfo	1	*	Heinous fuckery most foul
t1_dtvdv8l	1	*	Never heard that joke a million times before... 
t1_ds2cr2w	1	*	[dowh dowh dowh dowh](https://youtu.be/5rpAK3Y8DK8?t=797)
t1_ds3tu1g	0	*	No, I mean the Japanese government has the freedom to ask us to leave and we will. This is not hard, even for a wannabe edgelord such as yourself.
t1_ds3ffza	0	*	How politically correct of you. 
t1_du6xz5a	1	*	No, the anime scene is already toxic by such scenery. It needs to die.
t1_dtk98ix	1	*	Yeah I realise that. I dont know how they exactly reason with it but meh. Im fine payin 5 euros a month more if it means my children wont live in a world of fallout
t1_dtjn914	0	*	I was under the impression the UK gets a large proportion of gas domestically through the north sea.
t1_dtjm26b	0	*	The UK has never sourced a large amount of its gas from Russia. UKCS and Norway are the dominant sources, Netherlands too from the Groningen field.
t1_dtapc8o	0	*	You don't even want to know about the black dot in the middle of bird shit? Are you too busy pushing your **CARBON** agenda to ask? Did you give your car away yet? Otherwise, shut the hell up!
t1_duv5tfw	0	*	I guess if you like hunting polar bears then sure, go ahead, burn it all!
t1_duv915c	1	*	Great point!  Thank you!
t1_duvbcce	1	*	Understandable, especially if you use the metric system, but I'm used to getting shit about it from my buddies
t1_duwbe9p	1	*	I just can't understand how people,  as a whole  culture,  can care so little about where they live.  Especially when it's so visible.  
t1_duvdeq6	0	*	I only know that word because there's signs up all over the local head shop about legalizing it and stopping the government from taking it away
t1_duv9qvt	0	*	Thanks for contributing.
t1_duvroe1	1	*	Yeah but those damn hippie libruls
t1_duwb5gb	1	*	Used motor oil is full of carcinogens, hope you didn't play in the road as a kid.
t1_duva5qj	1	*	It's cheap, there's lots of beaches, lots of things to do, it's beautiful.
t1_duvefkh	1	*	Actually making eggs + bacon now. Thanks for the inspiration I didn't know I needed
t1_duvwyvq	0	*	How are people such assholes.  I feel like crap when I spill a bit of gas on my driveway when I put too much in my lawn mower.
t1_duvrwbc	1	*	It is indeed. You can look for a picture of the Dominican Border and the Haitian border for comparison.
t1_duv9jip	1	*	I think /u/naanandcurry was talking about two separate things. And saying Most of the trash on this island comes from the large rcountry it is a part of is actually a very meaningful statement.
t1_duvfpka	1	*	Totally, it needs to start/stop wth the locals.
t1_dtla0dy	1	*	He could be referring to Capetown literally running out of water...
t1_dukfd5i	1	*	you should just have clean piss strapped to your leg at all times, that's what the pros do
t1_dul3scs	0	*	Dont feel too bad. America is fucked up but our women arent being mass raped by refugees. You just gotta choose your battles. 
t1_dukruje	1	*	I see
t1_dsmupxa	0	*	No one likes turks.   Brits, Germans and Croats apologized. Held the people that did it accountable, stopped attacking their neighbors and moved on. Unlike Russia.
t1_dtxfbxj	1	*	For...reasons.
t1_dtxndtv	1	*	Lanaaaa!!
t1_ds2xju7	0	*	Yes, many billion of years from now the Universe will be void of life. How is that relevant to us fucking up the planet so we can't survive another ten thousand years?
t1_ds2kktb	1	*	The Bible is the perfectest book ever written and I don't need propaganda nonsense telling me otherwise. God can do anything.
t1_ds2lqcm	1	*	That's a fucking sad fact.
t1_ds2gna4	1	*	Shit by that logic than global warming caused the Dust Bowl 
t1_ds2vrat	1	*	> spending $500 billion each year capturing carbon dioxide   Roughly what the US spends on gasoline every year.
t1_ds2w3lh	1	*	Honestly, I think humans need to feel the effects before they will act. I think this will only delay things.
t1_dsupdpu	1	*	I cant attest to all companies, but some companies do pick vendors that have better workers rights and conditions in factories. Google is one of them.
t1_dt57fjk	0	*	And your country STILL sucks. Ill take all of that to be in the U.S. and not have to be from your dumpster fire of a country. 
t1_dt9p58m	1	*	Best place on earth
t1_du8sece	1	*	Complete nonsense.
t1_dsh4gaz	0	*	Yeah. In this case it's actually over something. Sure it's an extreme reaction but there was still a reason. 
t1_dsh9fgg	1	*	Jeeze. Then you go around posting it? This is literally how fake news spreads,  stop being illiterate idiots and fucking read!
t1_dsh2pnd	0	*	Oh the latter it's total bullshit. Just saying getting a rape kit anywhere can be a nightmare and is always invasive to some degree. 
t1_dshto9c	1	*	Yes.  Half of sperm will be y, half of it x.  It's generated by a parent cell splitting its chromosomes in half via meiosis, and each precursor cell has an xy pair.
t1_dti6cs7	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_dtismod	1	*	Except this is the longest bull run in modern history, which means that there is no way in hell it will go another 10 years.
t1_duqcn2r	0	*	Let me talk slower, since you apparently didn't understand:  Read   UNSC  Resolution  478
t1_dupvff7	0	*	i suggest you read the news!
t1_duq8mq5	1	*	Vatican city is a hill in the middle of Rome, it is nothing like Jerusalem. Also, the Vatican is a remnant of the papal states- a legitimate nation in its own right.
t1_duq7oxs	0	*	There was a war for independence? 
t1_dsm2upa	1	*	He got into Yale because he was from a rich powerful politically prestigious family. Mans dumb as a fucking rock.

t1_dsm4wqg	1	*	Good to know. Thanks chief.
t1_dskn26o	1	*	He's evil and should rot in jail but Trump simply hasn't had the opportunity to do what Bush did. I have no doubt that if he were president in the 2000s he would've even been worse than Bush.
t1_dslcmud	1	*	That's really a topic for the courts. One thing is clear, he can't on his own, he needs Congress to either pull out or amend a lot of regulations so he can pull out.

t1_dsjpi5u	0	*	Computer vision  Yeah no.
t1_dsjk261	0	*	It's like that group of scientists that want to ban nukes.  It's purely academic with no real bearing on reality. The reality is that drone swarms *will* be weaponized. Not a matter of if. 
t1_dsjhuzi	1	*	Ah ok. The youtube vid description said rocket. Ty!
t1_dsjxu6z	1	*	Wont somebody think of the squirrels!!
t1_dskan2z	1	*	How are they navigating these trees and buildings in their way?

t1_dtez8f7	1	*	the real question is, do you want russia to be powerful? Because putin makes that happen, so its better russia is weak by not having putin. His removal at any cost is useful to the USA. 
t1_dten9zl	1	*	That's the problem though. It doesn't say how it determines what sources to use. Just because it says it isn't biased doesn't mean it isn't...

t1_dsgzlpx	0	*	6 more months before we can elect someone else.  Although as much as I want to hope, I'm sure the next person won't be much better.
t1_dsh2rhf	0	*	Now if an employee wants higher wages they could ask but I imagine they will just be ignored.  If a collective agreement is made through a union between the staff and employer it is recognized.
t1_dshff6b	1	*	https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/03/which-is-australias-favourite-fast-food-chain/  True.

t1_dsi29fe	1	*	The average cost of this change to Tim Hortons stores? [$243,889.10](http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/by-the-numbers-tim-hortons-franchisees-and-ontarios-minimum-wage-hike) 
t1_dsgy30q	1	*	They also treat their employees like shit, and the food is pretty shitty. 
t1_dsh1iq5	1	*	Then the business dies and another pops up to take its place. Or the consumers lose that business and its not replaced because its not profitable and all those jobs are lost.
t1_dsha8fc	1	*	This irritates me - New England generally Blue - Dunks are the opposite of a progressive company  
t1_dsh2oqa	1	*	I don't think you have a good grasp of how bankruptcy works...

t1_dsh4338	1	*	That's a low blow Loblaw
t1_dsh4jgm	0	*	Coverage there isn't great. I deal with some Canadians in my job and some of them come to the US for healthcare. 
t1_dshh0et	1	*	They built one in central Ohio awhile back.  Went there a couple of times, but their coffee is really unimpressive.  I get better coffee at the Speedway gas station. 
t1_dsh7hac	1	*	I've honestly never had a Timmies cake. My family always went with the Dairy Queen icecream cakes. Atleast those are still around.
t1_dsh6qgw	0	*	Put you on an ice floe and wave goodbye

t1_dsgy0rx	1	*	Seriously. I literally just bought a bagel from there. Bagel? 2.25. with butter? 2.95. with cream cheese? 5.75! Like, wtf? 
t1_dshh9r6	1	*	And with their new app, I don't even have to risk talking to a cashier and having them mess my order. I can cut out the middleman, and get it messed up directly in the kitchen! 
t1_dsh5gcu	0	*	You're welcome anytime. We do see you as honorary Canadians. And hey, there's always room for one more province, and we all know there are too many states! 
t1_dsgu49n	1	*	Plus McDonalds coffee doesn't rot your gut... at least as much.    
t1_dsh920l	0	*	Lol did you just land here?  Next thing you know you'll be asking what is the significance of Participaction
t1_dsh6ttv	0	*	it's surprising there's room for tim hortons when there's already a caribou coffee or starbucks every mile.

t1_dsh13pq	1	*	Still gotta get a honey dip every now and then though.

t1_dsh2h4r	1	*	Oh well yeah. We all got that. I thought you meant real benefits. 
t1_dshcr25	0	*	Woah!,  There is still a huge taste difference between Ontario Tim's and Michigan Tim's.  I find the latter quite stronger
t1_dsh273t	0	*	Ive only eaten popeys once and it made me really drowzy im not sure how people can eat there regularly.   I think what OP was stating in the original comment is that they see a profit of 8m.
t1_dshf5h9	1	*	sorry
t1_dshs5k9	0	*	You can't take a poor person to the bank, so your comment makes no sense.   bye bye
t1_dsh3eki	0	*	Well that happens when pretty much any company goes tits up. Executives will always get theirs

t1_dshfi0v	0	*	Happy cakeday!!!!!
t1_dshf48f	0	*	Funny thing is they likely did this to try and salvage jobs. Your going to see automated order boards replacing people quicker and quicker now.
t1_dsh7fnf	1	*	What am I missing? To me their regular coffee has no flavor, and their Latte tastes like half water half milk stirred together with the same spoon that was just used to stir real coffee. 
t1_dt80cv2	1	*	Wow, it's an honor to meet you.
t1_dt90hma	0	*	I think you are overestimating how good the conditions in Pakistani prisons are.
t1_dt89rxz	1	*	And retards who can't grasp nuances. Oh wait, that's you.
t1_dtaskex	1	*	Yeah, I've seen plenty of death and bodies and fucked up shit. Hiding never helped noone.
t1_dt7ndbm	1	*	Yes it is. The majority of pedophiles do not rape children. Most child abuse happens at home by non-pedophiles. 
t1_dt7xtsv	0	*	When did I say that?
t1_dt7lbwq	0	*	that's like saying 'they're not hanging murderers, they're hanging people who illegally kill people' - people who rape children _are_ pedophiles.
t1_dt7kfn3	1	*	What, i'm asking the guy on his opinion on what constitutes mental illness.  Of course the guy in the article is mentally ill.
t1_dtfnxhu	1	*	Before and during the German invasion, some Poles also massacred Germans living in Poland. I guess nobody gives a flying fuck about that. Its called bloody sunday, it can be looked up.

t1_ds5rqrd	0	*	Brawndo: Its got what plants crave!
t1_ds6aebz	1	*	It's fine, if that were the case then the plastics would leech into the original drink, too. That's just fearmongering

t1_duaqstd	1	*	Yay :[
t1_dtbehvl	1	*	Even a non nuclear war would result in millions upon millions of dead, and humans aren't adverse to fire bombing entire cities or blasting them to nothingness either.
t1_dtbcvju	1	*	70,000 voters determined the entire election
t1_dtkcbrz	1	*	Trump and other Republicans retweet Russian propaganda accounts. It doesn't get much more reciprocal than that.
t1_dtbt3xo	0	*	Therefore the very idea of security is a dangerous and frightening prospect.

t1_duo6elh	0	*	Hey Ivan, how many posts you have to make before you get your daily vodka ration?
t1_duo5inm	0	*	Yeah. It happens all the time. The Syrian Government doesn't want an uprising, if an amnesty means that fighters will put down their guns and go back to work then that works for everyone
t1_dupnvu3	0	*	They should not have taken up arms against the government and accepted foreign military orchestration/aid...

t1_dsm1450	1	*	Just did this at the store. The nice Indian man furrowed his brows at me and said nothing. What's your secret?
t1_dslzcsp	1	*	the whole slap on the wrist to the top wall street executives after the housing bubble burst is a sore subject too.
t1_dsm8g7z	1	*	That's just how Americans talk in bars and locker rooms.
t1_dsm53ql	1	*	Seems like something you would remember.
t1_dsm0pbp	1	*	If someone isn't being a clear fuckwit and it's part of the conversation they'd probably get a person's heritage pretty easily
t1_dsm06hj	1	*	My dad used to tell stories of eating squirrel brains as a kid in Tennessee. Maybe theyre just trying to connect with you on a deeper level? Find some common ground and whatnot.
t1_dslzy08	0	*	Haha. Your supposition being that racism is always plainly out in the open?
t1_dslybsa	1	*	So it's all about your accent? 
t1_dsls341	1	*	Of course you can; if it's intelligent, thought out, relevant, and well spoken. If not, you will be discarded.
t1_dslx8f7	1	*	People pressing about unwanted topics isn't a race thing though. It happens to everyone lol
t1_dsmtcd3	1	*	Hi. I'm op. I make my own decisions and I form my own opinions. You can stop wasting your breath thinking your going to change mine and others mind. Carry on.

t1_dslxpg5	0	*	I've scrolled through hundreds of comments before coming across this. Finally. It's cringe. How oblivious they all are to how they are being manipulated by MSM.
t1_dslzy2f	0	*	Current climate.  Giving compliments is now news worthy and causes uproar.
t1_dsm45rj	0	*	Insisting is rude, asking is not. And if you did not specify you did not want to answer, you can't complain the person did not take the hint.
t1_dsm1svy	1	*	Yea, I feel like this is a question youd ask after breaking ice at least, or it can come off as racist(?) or rude.
t1_dsmem4g	1	*	He did that because Trump is a Jewish puppet. 
t1_dslvi6v	1	*	Just read about it. I can't believe believe it was not an Onion article. 
t1_dsm1wvu	1	*	Two others said they don't recall what he said. Not that he didn't.

t1_dsm62wm	1	*	Blood ocean! 
t1_dslvrca	0	*	Because she is unlikeable.  Still no logic to what you're saying though. He can be unfit regardless
t1_dslzpbv	0	*	We already know what happens when reality disagrees with trump, either crooked Hillary or obama gets blamed and he goes back to patting himself on the back for winning
t1_dslwzd5	0	*	I remember when he asked a black reporter to set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus

t1_dslx2b7	0	*	Every major party presidential candidate since Richard Nixon has released his tax return, but you're right,  who cares about nearly 50 years of precedence? Total nothing burger.
t1_dslwlmn	1	*	I wish for a day when we are all just identified as human and are differentiated from where we reside. I am a human who resides in Arizona.

t1_dsmrb72	1	*	Brah, i am a supporter too.

t1_dslx7ta	0	*	It's not the just difference of viewpoints as say Bush....it's the pussy-grabbing, it's the constant accusations of money laundering, sexism, racism, etc...

t1_dslyzzo	0	*	What if you were French Canadian though? Those are fighting words!
t1_dslxul0	1	*	Because you'd know he really didn't mean it, as it would be followed by thoughtful and intelligent sentences. 
t1_dsm5va5	1	*	I always ask where the name is from.   oh, that's an interesting name, where's that from or something.  
t1_dslzb62	1	*	TIL responding to where are you from? with the actual place you are from is considered smart ass manner.

t1_dslz7o9	0	*	Such bias in you Padawan, such bias indeed

t1_dslvl9u	0	*	/u/kcb1986 please dont say first term as if there will be a second term. It makes me vomitous. 
t1_dslyd64	1	*	Not if you're actually asking where they're from. But if they tell you Chicago and that's not the answer you were looking for then that means you asked the wrong question.

t1_due0tov	0	*	Its not laziness,  the 2 generic drug sellers just dont send sales reps to persuade the doctors. 
t1_dufpjgn	1	*	The real issue is the individual agents are old and dirt cheap.
t1_due15l6	0	*	True, but sometimes drug companies also do it just to get a band new patent and markup.

t1_due1uce	0	*	Concerta made my ball hurt.
t1_duf9fu3	1	*	Apparently people like to downvote facts that they find inconvenient. lol   You are completely right though.  The US by FAR contributes the most to medical research and research in general. 
t1_duee7ma	1	*	You're absolutely right, and I wouldn't want to see a truly free market anyway. I /would/ like to see a restructuring of patent law to better support market innovation and competition.
t1_dudxml8	0	*	>Whats to fix? Nothing stopping you just lowering yours to compete.  Outrage from the left. Media frenzy. Trump just literally did this and what have we all been told since?

t1_dtbptxg	1	*	Actually, he didnt say anything about racial purity and over 20% of Israels population isnt Jewish so you are completely talking out of your ass.
t1_dtbbnei	1	*	Uhhh Africa wasn't a colony. If you're actually comparing Africa to the us the better (but still inaccurate) comparison would be native Americans, who didn't fare so well

t1_dsqdk87	0	*	That was my thought. She ripped it or something and freaked out and made up some story and it snowballed into something far bigger than her 11 year old mind could have imagined.
t1_dsqdu5r	1	*	ALL SIDES
t1_dsq6e7a	0	*	It's far right of center, to say the least.   Though, these days; the far right is much more further than they used to be. They've kind of walked off the ledge and dropped into an ocean of crazy.
t1_dsqaut8	0	*	You guys did give millions to a literal terrorist soooooo
t1_dsqi6xc	1	*	Yep.
t1_dsqa1v8	1	*	The clock boy thing was never proven false, his parents were just proven stupid in the aftermath.  Balloon boy was the original big social media hoax that made someone famous for lying. 
t1_dsq5mpd	0	*	Speculation != telepathy ffs.
t1_dsq95dh	1	*	Right?
t1_dsq8o1s	1	*	Everyone rushes to be the super cool redditor that calls out the injustice first. Like reporters rushing to sensationalize, only at least they get paid for it.
t1_dsqa1fq	0	*	I yes those happen too often that no ones heard about that arn't reported 
t1_dsr4psw	0	*	Not black, but trans and a sex worker, which they keep attacking her for in court. They printed out a bunch of her ads and stuff even though it's not at all related. 
t1_dsqge9i	1	*	Jesus. You're right. The brother totally knew this was all bullshit. Can't hide anything with an expression like that...
t1_dsrsr6w	1	*	But Christianity isn't the reason they do it. They never yell praise Jesus when shooting people.

t1_dsq40ep	1	*	If she's aware of those issues and it can help her get out of trouble than shes not fomenting the issue, she's lying to get out of trouble. 
t1_dsq6uhl	1	*	Reddit refers to itself as a lynch mob all the time, because it has been and will continue to be a lynch mob.   If you refer to reddit as a single entity none of its actions make sense. 
t1_dsqautf	1	*	Maybe beat her up now :/ either way she on her way to a beatin'
t1_dsqgl2u	1	*	Even if it were legal, its purveyors would probably still be shamed by many.

t1_dsqbujt	1	*	Wise words. You sound like a stable genius. Your IQ must be like 200.
t1_dsqx0vs	1	*	Unfortunately given the circumstances, many people would assume they are fake even if they aren't now.
t1_dsr0uob	1	*	Or they get the same amount of coverage but to two entirely different audiences. And then everyone has something to re-enforce their already held opinions. 
t1_dsqjdnh	1	*	Some still do. He got a great gig out of it though, and helped push his narrative forward. Although Trump is now president, so maybe he didnt.
t1_dsqe8je	1	*	Not to mention she put hijabs on people (men and women) during that Women's March. By the way, aren't hijabs usually black polyester in Islamic countries?
t1_dsqf42x	1	*	Due to the fact that most kids don't possess the faculties to appreciate the effects or scope of their actions 
t1_dsq3q2p	1	*	But where did she get the idea to make it racial/religious? Or to run to the media? If she doesn't have an agenda, her parents do.
t1_dsq4csm	0	*	Your reply reminds me of the Duke Lacrosse hoax from a few years ago , Sure the evidence points to their innocence but by god something happened and I am pretty sure those rich white boys did it.
t1_dsq10xl	1	*	Highly suspicious, maybe it's an alt account?
t1_dsqq23a	0	*	You know your on Reddit, right? You are correct though.
t1_dsq5e1y	0	*	Not where I live, at least. Anyone offended by that book needs offending. 
t1_dsq7dk2	1	*	It's not just Reddit.  Social media in general has turned into a 24/7 lynch mob.  Scary shit.  
t1_dsqjlse	1	*	And why shouldn't people defend him? Wtf are you all on about? Random people saying he did it deliberatly is now proof is it?
t1_dsqga62	1	*	Nevada.
t1_dsr8qbi	1	*	Sure sounds like a Palestinian to me. Or maybe just plain old Canadian, eh?
t1_dsq8sn9	1	*	Thats the point, if truth is only putting on its pants instead of its shoes that means its another step behind.
t1_dsq6ryu	1	*	True but we are so far the other way. Good point. 
t1_dsqexe8	1	*	If you think that the truth is bigoted then you are well along the road to a very miserable place.
t1_dsqdab2	1	*	No, it wasn't. I don't know about that situation but it 100% is not the same person, though I'm not surprised to hear of another simaler situation. 
t1_dsqisvh	1	*	Shhh, don't be so insensitive, you know truth bothers them lol    Fact of the matter is MOST people are smarter than Trump, but his followers need someone on their level to identify with.
t1_dsqbuhw	1	*	That isn't the person I'm talking about but I wouldn't be surprised if this situation happened more than once. 
t1_dsq71qe	1	*	Agreed, which is why investigations are so important. 
t1_dsr2lj9	1	*	>Well stable geniuses don't have the speech pattern of a sixth grader  We have the worlds dumbest billionaire president!!! /s
t1_dsq2v1k	0	*	No no no, I need no further explanation. I now understand that a kid playing with a shitty clock is worthy of an arrest, and all the adults that were involved were very intelligent. Thank you again.
t1_dsq6qkk	0	*	That which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed with out evidence. If you'd like, I'll be happy to supply at least 10 cases of these hoaxes if you can supply 5 that were true.
t1_dsqfep7	0	*	Her parents should be for supporting the lie if nothing else. This could have ruined the poor guys life. I'm not sure why you think that's okay. 
t1_dsq6cgq	1	*	Probably an 11-year-olds version of virtue signaling. She probably expected a parental pat on the back for being a martyr but that it wouldnt go any further. 
t1_dsq9yce	1	*	Safety First!
t1_dsqdcqr	0	*	So if the attack had been real, you would think there's a problem going on with Islamophobia? Or would the incident being true or not true, have no effect on your opinion?
t1_dsqbbma	0	*	Funny I actually was going to guess you were around 14 or 15.
t1_dsr6ru2	1	*	Now how can we find a way to fuck up the economy for him ...
t1_dsqa08j	0	*	I'm combining this instance with others. In this case, there's no specific individual accused but there's a clear connection to racism that the victim is attempting to capitalize on and exploit. 
t1_dsqdxo0	0	*	Wow. Well if you're certain not much I can argue, is there?  Can I factor all the attacks we don't know about too then?

t1_dsywqa7	0	*	Considering that past presidents have given up their properties/businesses to have it not interfere with their ability to enact non-biased laws, this is a new low for presidents.

t1_dt1c1ry	1	*	Yeah, as if the United States has never artificially supported rebels in other countries for our own gain and then left them to die when we're done with them.  
t1_dt1ew4w	1	*	It's still a one-party system. Not saying America's 2 party system is any better, but reform isn't possible in China unless several key people want it to happen.
t1_dt1cg9n	0	*	Strange. I saw Kinder Surprises in some Chinese supermarket.
t1_dt1cpno	1	*	And North Korea is worse than is China's. That's irrelevant to the conversation though, just like China's track record is irrelevant to the US government shuting down. 
t1_dt1f94b	1	*	Sounds like what happens when you attempt to centralize the economy under the state
t1_dt1c8m6	0	*	I love weddings!
t1_dt1be1n	0	*	Its literally a Monarchy.  The government is called *Her Majestys Government*.  Thanks for the unnecessary rudeness, but youre wrong.
t1_dt1lvp7	0	*	It wasn't ok, I don't know where you got that from
t1_dt1pmpi	1	*	Welcome to the first Thanksgiving, pilgrim  - Peter Griffin as Winston Churchill
t1_dt1b6ww	1	*	It's a constitutional democratic republic. All three are as important as each other. Don't skip one.
t1_dt1mvsx	1	*	That's why I said pray.
t1_dt1edds	0	*	Do you feel this way about Nazi protesters?
t1_dt1cqyt	1	*	Who's that? I've never head of candleja

t1_dt1gpgf	1	*	We have slavery in the US literally right now. 
t1_dt1kyki	1	*	Being stupid isn't a mental illness.
t1_dt1b49i	1	*	The electoral college is a bad idea, yes.
t1_dt1b7y5	1	*	^ The shut down should be transitioned into a huge pork cut.
t1_dt1cmum	0	*	>my socialist European country  Transnistrians out in force today, I see.
t1_dt1rnmp	1	*	better question WHY should they?  hong kong is part of china now - so what is the point?  they can erode it's democracy all they want ...
t1_dt1fbou	1	*	haha they promise young kids who don't have much direction the world- money, travel, honor. I feel the same way, but you can't help who you fall in love with and the life they choose!
t1_dt1f2ny	1	*	Thanks. I was too lazy and drunk to find the exact description. 
t1_dt1brm0	0	*	Wyoming gets two senators, just like California. The congress is designed to represent the states equally AND proportionally. 
t1_dt1r7e6	1	*	Also, more than 50 years ago if you ask me. 
t1_dt1g7ry	1	*	yep
t1_dt1djfw	1	*	FUCK XI JINPING AND EVERYTHING HE STA
t1_dt5u848	1	*	It seems rather juvenile to point to anothers apparent failure as evidence of ones own perceived success. 
t1_dt30or0	0	*	That is the dumbest argument Ive ever heard. 
t1_e0grbnd	0	*	oh do shut up.
t1_dt1bksl	0	*	If they're happy about it then they're financially comfortable. A lot of people aren't.

t1_dt1b8c0	1	*	>Mr. Sun is also the deputy chairman of the County Peoples Congress Standing Committee, a powerful local position.  I'm sure he had some sort of say in it.
t1_dt18xhi	1	*	Doesnt China use a king?
t1_dt1m6z2	0	*	Thank goodness the US government isn't the sole facilitator of the US functioning. 
t1_dt1es3e	0	*	This is basically explaining why the way that Nebraska and Maine split their electoral votes COULD be a problem, but it has nothing to do with the outcome of any presidential election.
t1_dt1sn5n	1	*	If you've got the money, of course
t1_dt1eccn	1	*	Only in the US, but in most places when a government falls, it just means it's time for an election. No different than a midterm election etc in the US. What you're talking about is some sort of coup.
t1_dt1ddy6	1	*	Yah thats what I mean. They call it right to work in my state for some possessed reason (positive spin I guess) but you are correct 
t1_dt1kou4	1	*	Is that so? Could you elaborate on that? You must be quite knowledgeable about this to make a statement like this without explaination. 
t1_dt1r5bu	0	*	Sure if you're white.
t1_dt1plf4	1	*	Im too drunk to taste this chicken  * Col. Sanders 
t1_dt1bwwj	1	*	I made an edit to my comment saying that I made an error with the portion you've quoted, read the rest first...
t1_dt2m9dg	1	*	The thing is, the US system is worse than many other systems that have been tried. Like for example those democracies that control campaign spending and have proportional representation.
t1_dt1x791	1	*	Fucking hipocrite George Washington always lying out of his wooden teef....
t1_dt1lfuk	1	*	It was sarcasm 
t1_dt1oiet	1	*	Oh we're going to use old government policies to condemn them now?    Let's discuss slavery. 
t1_dt1kj4g	0	*	I think the median estimate is 1000. I think that's proportionally less than the 4 sadly enough.
t1_dt1frgf	1	*	No, that's London Bridge
t1_dt1gxq4	0	*	The point of that was although the USSR's criticism was accurate, it was clear that they were trying to deflect from their (in most cases far worse) human rights issues.
t1_dt2673w	1	*	You and your friends sound really fun. 
t1_dt1f6wg	0	*	And everyone working on research grants as federal contractors can suck a fat dick, eh?

t1_dt1dehu	1	*	So the accuser is hypocritical, that doesn't change anything about the validity of his claims. Sure, it puts them into perspective, but falling back on fallacies is the weakest of retorts.
t1_dt28tlj	1	*	The Mysterious Old Man who did narration in V was okay too, but it did sound like he was reading a lot of his lines for the first time.
t1_dt5u8sb	1	*	So what do you think?
t1_dt2bfu1	0	*	Por que no los dos?
t1_dt13wo0	1	*	No dude Im not discrediting anyone, Im saying both countries have a lot of fucked up shit on their respective plates. And is it not obvious that communist China is no where near a democracy? 
t1_dt1fs2n	1	*	paid vacation!!!  
t1_dt12ym7	0	*	Naturally not all of them. Most managed to flee. But many were indeed mangled by the tanks.
t1_dt1o6lm	0	*	And the PAP is not doing as well as before. The facade is already cracking. 
t1_dt1a5uq	1	*	They already started making the series...
t1_dt1ckbg	1	*	I spent so much time playing Tropico. So many political hit squads!
t1_dt1asj3	1	*	Hunger games
t1_dt1gw8w	1	*	There has been.  Past performance does not necessarily prove future endeavors. 
t1_dt271db	1	*	For all of its ills, the United States' commitment to freedom of speech is commendable. Nobody can deny it.
t1_dt1ezpz	1	*	I feel bad for the military members that lose pay because they cant just quit. Federal law enforcement on the other hand? Fuck them broke until they decide to find an honest way to make a living.
t1_dt1cjbh	0	*	Then they realize they over paid you, don't tell you, and then sends the debt to collections after a few months :/
t1_dt1w4lf	1	*	That's why he is such great propaganda for the Chinese government and other non-democratic governments elsewhere (e.g. Iran).  Of course they don't mention more successful democracies.
t1_dt1w4li	1	*	He's notorious for it so I already had him tagged. 
t1_dt1neq9	0	*	China has modern day wage slavery tho
t1_dt1nwuy	0	*	I for one welcome our new AI overlords 
t1_dt1mh12	0	*	But better than the people talking shit, right? 
t1_dt1mpup	1	*	Quite good actually.  The Chinese police aren't actively shooting them dead simply for being black, unlike in the US.
t1_dt2l9z8	0	*	I'm just waiting till I can join the Martian Congressional Republic.   F you, Earthers
t1_dt1eb9m	0	*	Ho Chi Minh too 
t1_dt1845p	0	*	The people may have risen first. But the government fell because of external forces. That is not what happened in Egypt and Tunisia.
t1_dt1d5yf	1	*	Based on what historical study are you claiming this. Which democratic societies ended up being real long-lived, compared to the autocracies of history.
t1_dt1ez16	1	*	Except for me of course
t1_dt1b77b	0	*	So have wonderballs been illegal in the US for a while too? I was under the impression they were the same thing basically. 
t1_dt1mqz6	1	*	Lol got me there. 
t1_dt1prnd	1	*	Go look at the ghost cities in China as a start. That is a bad sign.
t1_dt1f1bw	1	*	This. Theyll end up getting time and a half when they get back.
t1_dt3fgfz	1	*	One stayed (mostly) within his country's own borders, the other did not? 
t1_dt43rzk	0	*	Yeah, kind of a different issue from fining people for smoking it in the first place though, isn't it?
t1_dtx3m50	0	*	The only fucking idiot here is yourself.  
t1_dv2g54t	1	*	Honestly, it is. It's just a much more soft and justifiable form of manipulation. I'm European and you're not gonna hear me say we shouldn't do it, but let's call a horse a horse. 
t1_dv1qs6q	1	*	Oh God here we go. Alright I'll bite. What do you think was so unfair about Obama's trade policy?
t1_dv2t5qu	0	*	An electoral system they successfully exploited...
t1_dv28m8h	1	*	In terms of self-sufficientcy, the comparison would have to be US Vs. EU. The member states aren't going to give up their cooperation and trade.
t1_dv30ph1	1	*	Fox News will sort that out. And CNN will regurgitate whatever Fox News says with some arguments about how right they are.
t1_dv1oaq6	0	*	The easiest part about being a fundamentalist is that you already know the one true answer, eh? 
t1_dv1ik33	0	*	RemindMe! In 10 years about the downfall of the EU.
t1_dv2fh55	1	*	When they do it in such a way to favor a given election outcome how is that not meddling in elections?
t1_dv1tng3	0	*	Shiteass
t1_dv2o1yu	1	*	We aren't giving away anything with trade.  That's the whole point of trading in the first place.  We exchange money for stuff we want.
t1_dv2kp13	1	*	Yes.  And Bush was a one off and Trump is a 180. 
t1_dv2ed5t	0	*	Im also pretty sure that europe can do fine without american junk food and cars.
t1_dv3uxx3	0	*	LG gone, Samsung gone  Apple would celebrate
t1_dv23rkr	1	*	Just like how Obama blamed Bush for everything the 1st 8 years of his Presidency.
t1_dv1i18l	1	*	Link to said experts and their sayings?
t1_dv340kv	1	*	There's a difference between thinking someone would be a better president and deciding that a ridiculous clown might be a better choice than a criminal.
t1_dv1pe2b	0	*	I'm not sure you understand what's going on. the EU and US aren't cutting off trade. 
t1_dv2cb69	1	*	Yes, and then you sell the infected meat on store shelves and feed the leftover carcasses to the remaining other cattle.
t1_dv288nn	1	*	Well good news, this administration had me needing the larger sized container for my alcohol needs anyway. 
t1_dv25zxu	1	*	Yes and Putin is the emperor.
t1_dsy2hpa	0	*	They can downvote actual history as much as they want. Doesn't change the facts.
t1_dsytv0e	0	*	Most of these refugees are military age young men. They can fight.
t1_dsye8f3	0	*	Out of surreal and morbid necessity.  Their society is fraying.  
t1_dtq13dw	1	*	may your water be blessed and rock under your boots
t1_dtpi09y	0	*	Are you sure? Last I heard scientists briefly considered them extinct in the wild until they found a few in the canals branching from the lake.
t1_dtr2mhu	0	*	Where's this image from anyway?
t1_ds4g9fy	1	*	Why did you remind me of that video?! Nearly spit out my coffee at the office.
t1_ds3gjhf	0	*	I didn't just say that. Can you show me exactly where I said that?
t1_ds3urng	0	*	Really? Almost every festival in Aus Ive been to Ive seen girls topless, with either glitter, body paint or just natural. Its definitely acceptable. 
t1_ds45bmy	0	*	I think he made a decent attempt at putting into words the perspective of many men. 
t1_ds4bvgv	0	*	Nothing grants the right to steal too. Having no consent when you take something is STEALING much like no consent when you touch somebody is ASSAULT. 
t1_ds3t0zu	1	*	It's not illegal there.
t1_dtrqeb6	1	*	> Yup, our two party system is now two undesirable extremes to choose from. >  > Reform democracy while you can.   FTFY 
t1_ds6i5p1	0	*	The astronomical headline was added by some sort of anti-immigrant troll.
t1_ds6kska	1	*	Yep, makes sense really. America is 60% white and 1% Muslim. Do the math and Muslims commit more terror style attacks than other groups. 
t1_dummgfb	0	*	Let's just keep everything how it is now then I guess...things are so good already...
t1_dumu2uj	0	*	What are you talking about? The top schools in the country are all private, and they definitely care about grades. 
t1_dt6ke7s	1	*	Seems like you are buying the #releasethememo trash the Russians are peddling.   Go ahead and release it.  Ohhh.  Scary.  
t1_dt6g55a	1	*	See, it was pretty obvious that you must believe the fake news peddled by Trump and the GOP once you started trying to tag every single person ITT that you don't like as an /r/politics poster.
t1_dthqpv2	0	*	Thanks Scientologist with a great Thetan level!
t1_duh7rev	1	*	Yeah nobodys that obsessed about gay sex unless theyre _obsessed_ with gay sex. 
t1_duh3zlu	0	*	Nothing is going to end this administration as long as Republicans are in control. If they cared he would already be impeached.
t1_duh9c9n	0	*	Does that phrase also describe Trump?
t1_duhfgct	1	*	I mean... that's not really a huge jump is it.
t1_duh6b0i	1	*	Cooperate with what, exactly?  Is there some evidence of higher crimes I have missed?  Legit question.
t1_duh2fji	0	*	Manafort was not on that boat, I don't think even Navalny started that.
t1_dugmzr1	1	*	Once youve sailed to Cheddar Bay...
t1_duhpk78	1	*	I'ma gonna flows a little more nicely, I think.
t1_dugpgcu	0	*	Sometimes they are not. But you just need to convince a grand jury that the overwhelming evidence of intent makes the action itself obstruction.
t1_duh235g	0	*	Then he's not really being a very good double agent, is he?
t1_duhchd0	0	*	lmao that was good
t1_duh184n	0	*	Well, that's presumably because none of Hillary's aides *did anything*, whereas everyone in this circus is already an evidenced (if not convicted) scumbag.
t1_duh680m	1	*	Ken starr disagrees. 
t1_duh3cob	1	*	At least Billy Joel tried.

t1_dugxwma	1	*	Pretty simple, really. 
t1_duh3y1t	1	*	Hot scoop. Did your haunted toaster tell you this? Or was it your alien abductors?
t1_dugv8yu	1	*	Oy! Get stuffed ya cunt.
t1_duh291y	1	*	Yes, more proof that morons are stupid.  It is really starting to pile up.
t1_dugx5t8	1	*	haha, oh yes, few of us are. What a legend
t1_duhbcvu	1	*	Whats a constitutional crisis?
t1_duhb3iw	1	*	Sarcasm. *WHOOSH*
t1_duh6cn5	0	*	Do you think Donald Trump colluded with the Russian government to affect the 2016 election - yes or no?
t1_duh1rne	1	*	I got a Scooter-Libby sense of deja vu. Manafort might never roll on the godfather if he's been promised a pardon.
t1_dugsib7	0	*	Lol they're getting desperate because we're over their shit now.
t1_duh47a0	1	*	Can we start milling their deck?

t1_duiyra4	0	*	Gosh, I wonder?
t1_dv40q6k	1	*	Oh thank god. I hate sunburns and can't wait until we're all mixed enough to stop getting them.
t1_dv437pp	1	*	Yeah, getting religion right is an oxymoron to begin with.
t1_dv3u8r0	0	*	Who told you these things?
t1_dv40bp3	1	*	Slightly different idea, because these two rhinos are of the same species.  A humanzee would be more like a mule or liger, but we havent officially made one successfully and it might not be possible.
t1_dv3snr0	0	*	50% of the time, it's boners every time.
t1_dv4cv5m	0	*	No predators at all - are you sure on that one?
t1_dv469r7	0	*	Move him to Greenland
t1_dv3ymgs	0	*	Peach Snapple best Snapple
t1_dv3uce5	0	*	Well at least we didn't hunt/pouch the species we didn't know about to extinction. Sadly, we'll never know if any of them would have induced massive boners.  
t1_dv44w8b	1	*	Animals are going extinct all over the world, particularly in the US. There is no you guys, its a global problem. 
t1_dv4k3ss	0	*	Poor Africans are being given guns to get rhino horns. Only poor Africans will do it because its very likely you get killed or arrested. The money to supply weapons comes from Asia.
t1_dv40sj9	1	*	Reddit 101.  Don't misuse the voting system, dammit! 
t1_dv3yndm	1	*	 We're kind of moreso just the most unique thing to occur as a species, and haven't really grown into recognizing our impact yet. 
t1_dv5povc	1	*	You know what you can blame on the Asians? Shar-Pei dogs. Thanks, Asia.
t1_dv4dxqq	1	*	How about starting with yourself?
t1_dv496bh	1	*	It is one of the worst things. If aliens do find us I don't think we will be able to justify our actions at all.
t1_dv450tu	1	*	V funnee!! Ha ha ha
t1_dv4ceg8	1	*	That's extremely sad :(

t1_dv3zwle	0	*	I just don't think this planet as is is meant for such a beautiful creature, call me a cynic but they deserve better. True imo, not trying to state fact.
t1_dv41x5l	0	*	Another nihilist on Reddit, how surprising. 
t1_dv3yt5x	1	*	That might save the rhinos...but at a cost to other species that won't get saved. It has to stop with demand.  Just figure out how to convince everyone to demand jellyfish, and we'll be fine.
t1_dv44k1x	1	*	This is the kind of examples I was looking for, got a link?
t1_dv4034f	0	*	You and people like you are the problem. 
t1_dv45hga	1	*	No sapient is correct. Don't correct when u don't know what the original post is saying 
t1_dsv9w99	1	*	What perspective must you have to see that?  From the outside looking in where I have a unbiased opinion is a pretty good perspective.
t1_dsucxzu	1	*	Maybe if you're 15 years old.
t1_dtew1yx	0	*	Did I say anything even remotely similar to that? I sure didn't. You clearly missed my point.
t1_du8ajqr	1	*	Basically what you're saying is Arabs are evil and subhuman, let Israel do whatever they please. 
t1_du8ptpj	1	*	Ahh you know the tru tru.

t1_dtsq1iv	0	*	Thank you, couldn't remember the exact details.
t1_dtrexvk	1	*	And the police did look in to it. They looked into it so much, that they put a person under survailence and managed to arrest him due the evidence gathered by the police.

t1_duhy2aj	1	*	Funny I specifically said when they started recording(79) -2015. Obviously things can and have changed in 3 years but that doesn't make my post or the original article wrong.  
t1_duhogxp	1	*	Fuck you damn foreigner. If its cold as ice well ask your opinion.
t1_duhnqsc	1	*	TIL plants grow better in ice  Im going to put all my faith in Elon Musk getting me off planet before that happens. 
t1_duhjeah	1	*	Because our government is ass and cares more about money
t1_duhpj8q	1	*	as an american. 100% agree.  we dont riot as we are still to comfortable to riot or the propaganda networks have convinced the most riot-able the problem is with SJW's or ANTIFIA.  
t1_duhg9mz	0	*	Sure. Move out of cities and your cars to tropical Africa. Where there is still no electricity and significantly reduced life expectancy.
t1_duhm0i3	0	*	Those problems are actually pretty difficult and time intensive to solve. You can be angry, but it won't necessarily get things done faster just because you want to think that it can be.

t1_duho4m4	1	*	Yep I dont know what to tell you this country is a mess we are run by backwards ass fucks. 
t1_duhnje7	1	*	Nothing gets done because our politicians have been bought and just don't give a fuck. People donate to charities all the time, but the government is what actually has the tools to solve those issues.
t1_duhmk2q	1	*	Don't get me started!  But, YES, you are absolutely correct.
t1_duhlxq6	1	*	You made this comment because you knew you'd get upvotes because reddit loves America bashing.

t1_dtcthx9	1	*	Read the rest of this particular thread. It has been addressed.
t1_dtd0y5r	1	*	Arguing against democracy by picking America as an example is like arguing against European food by picking out Surstrxf6mming.
t1_dtcoxw6	1	*	South Korea as well, and even Japan to an extent.  In order to achieve the rapid development they saw, most of the people, but mainly the poor had to be exploited.
t1_dtbxsww	1	*	No our Congress as it is right now is too incompetent to even be that.
t1_dtcwcbd	0	*	You realize that means Hong Kong was democratic for more than 20 years right ? Which means an entire generation of adults grew up in a democracy. So no it was not always a farce.

t1_dsnshoj	1	*	they probably care much more about being able to cheat on taxes than protecting us against the banks
t1_dsmn69c	0	*	So you think people should be able to carry out commercial level criminal offences without punishment?  There's no real punishment there besides a slap on the wrist of community service.
t1_dsmg2c5	1	*	So you can't understand why something that is done on a computer is cheaper than something which requires counting, tracking and moving physical objects?
t1_dsnb53s	0	*	It's getting banned because banks and governments don't want you to use cash.
t1_dsnfs68	0	*	If some customers are less expensive to deal with that others (you), it is entirely fair that they pay less and you pay more.

t1_dsmi1as	0	*	Of course the full cost of the product is included in the price, otherwise every single supermarket would go bankrupt eventually.
t1_dtsifo7	0	*	A lack of regulataions is not the defining characteristic of a free market. You can craft regulations that increase market freedom.
t1_dtru07e	1	*	People in US has a religious belief complex for 'freedom', anything with a 'freedom' tag would automatically get a boost of affection by 50%.
t1_dtrnz38	1	*	It's better than peanut butter, at least.  *ducks away*

t1_dueut9t	0	*	Well, I'm just saying that sometimes you can cheer at the mob from a distance for perfectly rational reasons. So hell yeah they do, I guess.
t1_dues5hr	1	*	It's true. You are right. But I've known of some cases of heinous crimes commited by people who walked free because of this. It's a tradeoff, as you said.

t1_du1r738	1	*	Good point
t1_du1wpfn	0	*	4 billion is penuts for a country. Thats was just to prevent them all from dying. You cant do anything with 4 billion as a country. 
t1_du1i2xl	1	*	More reason not to pull such an idiotic stunt.
t1_du1fehi	1	*	This sounds like a way better movie than Olympus has fallen. The premise seems similar too, just switch South Korea with America 
t1_du1djov	1	*	...in 1968  ...while the vietnam war was ongoing   Since then SK presidents have visted Pyongyang two different times.
t1_du26a7u	0	*	Dont act like you dont know the UN was formed by the allied forces as a direct result of the war.

t1_du1evz4	0	*	What if Germany had nukes and the ability to destroy Moscow/London/Paris/NYC/DC/SF?  In that case the only alternative is nuke them before they nuke us, I guess.
t1_du2cho8	0	*	The US can always strike NK nuclear weapons without SKs support or consent. Don't forget that.
t1_du17xom	1	*	But a unified korea none the less.

t1_duqjbmr	0	*	> You'd rather see things your own way, through your lens, and judge everyone and everything by your merit.  Yes, that is what decent people do. 
t1_duq32tg	0	*	No Tibet is still not free. And the only thing that can still free it is military intervention. A lot of it. And if that's not going to happen, Tibet will never be independent. So why even mention it?
t1_duqhcn1	1	*	I'm with you, friend.
t1_dv0fmjs	1	*	Yeah, there's a multitude of factors involved (well, all of them are really just inequality with extra steps) rather than just black market access.
t1_dv07kb9	0	*	That would work too, but perhaps its easier just to restrict access to guns

t1_dsorwm5	0	*	Interesting...  Do you have any info on what they actually do?
t1_dt2je5b	1	*	If Mexico occupied the USA, denied rights to all its citizens, then built settlements across it for Mexican citizens, I suspect there would be some controversy. 
t1_dsfi2ri	1	*	A verbal promise no one has ever heard is a law and yet the Budapest Memorandum is 'only' a memorandum. Siberia's calling, time to go home Ivan.
t1_dsg2745	1	*	Thanks for all the info in the previous comment and this one!
t1_dsfohm8	0	*	And the USN still took the threat fo swarm tactics and the need for more small surface combatants seriously. As fucked up as it has become the LCS program was in part motivated by that need. 
t1_dsfr1x6	0	*	I thought the economy went to shit because oil prices collapsed to 1/3rd. I didnt realize Russia even cared about the sanctions.

t1_dt06xrq	1	*	Happy birthday!

t1_dt03qgp	0	*	But youre in Calgary, canada's texas, home of rich oil billionaires, and poor homeless people with the worse social safety net in the country. That's a recipe for crime.  And also paranoia.

t1_dszymau	0	*	You know that like 50%, or some ridiculously high number like that, of murders are never solved right? It is really easy to get away with murder as long as you don't have a motive.
t1_dt01oj3	1	*	Theres a reason its straight out of a Hollywood movie  It used to happen all the time; and now apparently still happens. 
t1_dt0gh7w	1	*	I don't feel like one though! Should I take you, random reddit person's word to heart? 
t1_dszv54j	0	*	Don't be, just another Reddit detective. Probably a gamer. They're harmless IRL.

t1_dt03t3r	0	*	The fact that they're rich and powerful has everything to do with the investigation and suspicion that they were murdered. 
t1_dt044ec	1	*	His company isnt going anywhere though. Maybe they were sending a message to the next person who takes it over ... then theyll have a chat 
t1_dszyqyy	0	*	THIS IS WHY WE NEED PUBLICA. Its a crypto currency that would have made it much easier for this man to get his book out. Not even coin shilling here just stating the truth!

t1_dt01bns	0	*	OP just meant that he literally owns a drug company and could easily get access to drugs to use for a painless suicide. 
t1_dt02yon	1	*	Perhaps whoever wanted them murdered used what's described in the article as camouflage, believing that everyone would automatically assume the feud was the motive?

t1_dtn1nn8	0	*	and no, I didn't edit after you replied. I added a link for you, which you jumped all over, cherry picked the highest number in it you could find show you could put me in my place
t1_dtnv2iz	1	*	How strong is the evidence of a cover up caused by strong evidence?
t1_dtnsnwf	0	*	Oh, my apologies for the contentious tone. Thank you for your reasonable replies.
t1_dtnd12a	1	*	seems worth wild
t1_dtoiu3q	0	*	Yeah... you know FOR SURE, huh?
t1_dtow00p	1	*	Since when do conspiracy theories have to make sense? People legitimately think that 97% of climatologists are lying about climate change for no apparent reason. 
t1_dtnvezx	1	*	One, two forces kneel before you
t1_dtntiv7	0	*	True, but let's not forget that educated people could be theater, business, or liberal arts majors instead of say biology or pre-med.
t1_dtn66j4	1	*	Cause that's a great tactic to bury information and divert attention from a higher power.   There's sensible theories that are purposefully over blown.

t1_dupu1r6	1	*	That would be Omnisapient, though.
t1_duulaqi	1	*	They hope. But in a more earthly analogy if you get your third expensive speeding ticket your spouse may forgive you, but you still have to pay the ticket.
t1_dupx8ki	1	*	>The dude is getting out in 8 years  This shows me that you either haven't read the article, or you have some agenda for misrepresenting the facts.
t1_duppxyo	1	*	You should add spoilers for the 95% who want to comment without reading the article.
t1_dt0pztx	1	*	Not. Yet.

t1_dt4d91o	1	*	Or Phyllis Vance's farts!
t1_dt4lkpy	0	*	I guess I grew up with weed in the house so maybe that's why the smell doesn't bother me. Tobacco makes me gag. I would rather breathe through a dirty sock I've worn all day than sit near a smoker.
t1_dt4ld3l	0	*	Tobacco smoke makes me gag if I get too close. I grew up with weed in the house so I guess that's why the smell has never bothered me even before I smoked.

t1_dt4fdne	0	*	you bet lol, I dont know how no one ever busted them, their corridor smells like that 24/7 even when they are out.
t1_dt5qgxs	1	*	shes not wrong, it metabolizes differently in the liver (11-hydroxy-THC) during ingestion which is particularly effective at crossing the blood-brain barrier resulting in a more intense high.
t1_dt4u95t	1	*	It's illegal in Ontario to smoke indoors. So smoking lounges are illegal.

t1_dt4o8nc	0	*	Almost like certain minorities will find themselves at odds with the law more than others and with yet another law that can be selectively enforced.
t1_dt4o1bd	0	*	That's completely missing the point that nobody will likely enforce it. Cops are probably glad to get on with solving some real crimes.
t1_dt4q0j5	1	*	So says you. I for one disagree
t1_dt4ug9i	1	*	yea i know its a non issue. i mean, its currently ILLEGAL and everyone smokes it all the time everywhere. its just a silly rule. 
t1_dt4ths7	1	*	Touchxe9. But don't you think if landlords can forbid it they would? 
t1_dt4og2a	1	*	smoking in a rental wouldn't be illegal, it'd just be against the terms of the lease...
t1_dt5jl0u	0	*	Sounds like a dirty place regardless of the smoking, and even if not, this is an extreme case, not just someone puffing on their pipe a few times a day.  
t1_dt4pcxx	0	*	But that's wrong. There are no known carcinogens in vape liquid, though I am not sure about Marijuana in the mix. But that's not even the point for landlords. It's about the value of their property.

t1_dsk53ux	1	*	Wow, you are dumb.
t1_dsjn8q4	1	*	Anything for that sweet sweet data.
t1_dsjkbhn	0	*	They did that to the Nazis as well, you know going to the moon and all that.   Hell even the Russians did it. 
t1_dskqrw5	1	*	It's whataboutism but it's still a valid point. Ignoring points made through whataboutism only brings about more whataboutism because they don't get addressed.
t1_dsj9xzl	1	*	True but not often discussed. Like most shameful things, people hope that it will be forgotten.
t1_dskhy4n	1	*	really reminds me of how most americans deal with slavery

t1_ds68eln	1	*	South Asians make up more than half of the Qatari population, if they were given proper rights they would be running the place. 
t1_ds887ra	0	*	Eh, it's not cheaper tbh. I was just at my local McDs last night and a SMALL hot chocolate was like $2.59, which is definitely higher than Timmies
t1_ds8j2y9	0	*	>3,468 in Tim Hortons in Canada. $200/day = $693,600. $693,600 * 12 = $8,323,200.   Why are you multiplying by 12 to go from days to years? You're short by a factor of 30.
t1_ds8tsbk	0	*	Well that's interesting, because such businesses actually make products available for cheaper, raising the standard of living of minimum wage workers.
t1_ds8qm5w	0	*	Are Apple employees generally making minimum wage?  Well, maybe the ones at the Apple stores, but they're retail. 
t1_ds8fmbi	0	*	I'm a millennial myself, but I do agree that there is a large sense of entitlement and a low sense of appreciation amongst a lot of the people here. 
t1_ds9l7j8	0	*	Im confused. You want the cheese below your egg? Infidel 
t1_ds8czxm	0	*	This would be an accurate comparison if minimum-wage employees made up 100% of operating expenses.
t1_ds909rp	1	*	The argument is not about minimum wage...god...you don't know how to read. The argument is about benefits. And whether a person can live on the minimum wage, which they can. 
t1_ds8l6p2	1	*	Haha wow, thank you for bringing this up by bye Tim Hortons!
t1_ds8d7ve	1	*	you're appealing to feels and not actual economics. don't be so hypocritical in the same place. 
t1_ds9rekd	0	*	In comparison to the rest of Canada and the US, Ontario had a pretty high minimum wage, actually.

t1_dtdmatp	1	*	I've met plenty of people with masters degrees who I would consider just as dense. That academic achievement, especially by a wealthy child, doesn't actually provide as much credibility as it should. 
t1_dtdg5sz	1	*	Seem to be living in a bit of a bit of an alternative reality bubble there, lol. 
t1_dtedlz4	0	*	Oh I definitely don't agree with a lot of Jr's policies.  But disagreeing with someone and thinking they are stupid are two different things.
t1_dtd3nvq	1	*	Honestly I'm amazed he didn't just name the kid Robert Barron.

t1_dtdekt1	1	*	Trump is dumb he doesn't know words!  Actually he was saying a real word.  Yeah whatever nerd. 
t1_dtczz83	1	*	Seriously, look at the mess we are in now. Finally, a valid excuse to say Thanks, Obama.
t1_dtd0t9u	0	*	Yeah i still have it too. I even spell it that way to certain people. If you like the drumpfinator try the cloud to butts extension. 
t1_dtd2d10	1	*	I wouldn't be surprised if he had several billion, but I think the majority of his wealth is off the books, seeing where it came from.

t1_dtd0i75	0	*	I envy your metaphor abilities.
t1_dtd7eje	1	*	Its the accent paired with the fact that the media loved to play his gaffs as sound bytes. Obama was a great orator, highlighting his intelligence. Bush relied on being relatable.
t1_dtd2mim	1	*	The guy's rich, he's a billionaire that isn't in question.  Trump Corp is a private company with 20K+ employees and I think Forbes had it ranked as the 50th biggest private US company recently.
t1_dtcral2	1	*	But other countries, especially developing ones are not in the same league as the USA and haven't had a 100 years benefit either.  
t1_dtd2vai	0	*	Is he aware of how much his father is hated?
t1_dtdaud8	0	*	What exactly is the issue with the TPP, in your own words?  I don't actually know that much about it, and I'm worried I was a sucker for propaganda.

t1_dtdd57g	1	*	What's the point?
t1_dtdho52	0	*	So were giving them stuff that costs money. How is that any different
t1_dtd6h9o	1	*	Yep, because Generalissimo Kleptoski in bumblefuckistan totally needs those millions for some solar panels and really really promises not to spend that money on suppressing his political enemies.
t1_dtd1w8g	1	*	I don't think Trump's heard this one yet otherwise he'd be using it

t1_dtd6tj7	0	*	Could you elaborate?

t1_dut4jia	1	*	That is the most likely scenario. The breaking down is just as essential as the building up.
t1_dsta1xy	0	*	I heard different opinions but its good to hear they may have been exaggerated. People sense pain differently. I cant judge because I didnt do it.  Btw, why did you do it?
t1_dsrssx1	0	*	This was based on a recommendation that's more than 20 years old. This link you posted is from 1996. Many studies have shown preventative benefits of circumcision since. See above.

t1_dsrs1o8	1	*	Did you literally just call me an insecure man with a mutilated dick? Are you serious? Attack circumcision, attack circumcised people. What a movement.
t1_dupb7nn	0	*	You literally did imply that when the very mention of NATO civilians made you pedantically and as it turns out, incorrectly correct someone.

t1_dt9dex6	0	*	Being both fast and accurate is important for any job. I think that's why professors make tests that are hard to finish in the time limit, to raise the skill ceiling beyond just knowing material.

t1_duibulv	1	*	Small compromises become large compromises because small steps forward are better than no progress at all.

t1_dtn1n51	0	*	Ha!  Have you ever met a Federal Judge?  They give pressure, they don't get it.  A Federal Judge is the only person that can say no to the President and make it stick.

t1_ds50m1w	0	*	I enjoyed everything in this comment. Thanks for the links, interesting reads. 
t1_dtenjo9	1	*	Fair enough, makes sense really. Farming seems to be one of the things where economies of scale can just make a huge difference to everything you do

t1_due6mpm	1	*	It was a non-binding advisory referendum. I strongly suspect that if people were offered a second vote, which outlined the complete lack of a plan, they might change their minds
t1_dt2i08x	0	*	I hate Erdogan too, but let's be real, NATO and western world will always hate Turkey even with another leader. 
t1_dtmzj8s	1	*	That much was obvious. :p
t1_dts1q4u	1	*	When Trump says something like this Trumptards praise him for being tough on terrorism. If it's Obama they call him a drone happy warmonger.
t1_du823rk	0	*	Usually the tributes go the other way in a hegemony 
t1_du8dj9u	0	*	Yes it does, it keeps friendly governments in power. If they weren't friendly to Israel they wouldn't get any aid. 
t1_dt6u7nu	1	*	Naturally, it's really the only way.
t1_du72psi	0	*	we must be reading different articles. I read that they have not gotten a single charge or conviction. 
t1_dtvbaje	0	*	excuse to what?
t1_dtugr4p	1	*	Thank you!
t1_dtv4bbs	0	*	I've always enjoyed MREs for the novelty and high calorie content. Sugar and fat taste good. But your friends tend to look at you weird when you bring them camping and get overly excited about them. 
t1_dtubpel	0	*	The utilities company I work for just sent hundreds of linemen to PR to restore power free of charge.
t1_dtu742u	0	*	Yeah! You showed him with your superior source and scathingly insightful response!  /s

t1_dtelifd	1	*	Thanks for this. I just spent ten minutes sobbing for my grandchildren (who don't exist yet). Then i read the rest of the thread. 
t1_dtf92it	1	*	Isn't that just burying my head in the sand though? It doesn't ruin my day or anything. Just makes me feel helpless. But also makes me want to be in a position where I've got power to make a change.

t1_dtemw7r	1	*	Every single person alive today, including uncle jimmy, and little timmy. 
t1_dteg4j2	1	*	Well, its right around the corner. Lets see if humanity rises to the occasion.

t1_dteov1c	1	*	Yes. We are. Its biblical.  every living thing in the sea shall die. Rev 16:3. 
t1_dteiflh	1	*	Environment is an easier sell because it could affect the person or their family, not an animal they've never met.
t1_dtethn6	0	*	There it is, the casual eugenics comment.
t1_dtfm4yi	1	*	a term for this is [future discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference#Temporal_discounting) or more generally, temporal discounting.

t1_du62zel	1	*	Yeah, needs fewer tomatoes. 
t1_dt2id6p	0	*	Yeah because you cant prove me wrong. If you could then you would, instead of pulling this i'm too smart for you bullshit. 
t1_dudf6qe	1	*	It is not the single biggest source. I've spent a decent amount of time wading through the statistics. It's big but not the biggest. 
t1_dsi19n0	0	*	Your retort makes no sense.  I'm not peddling a conspiracy theory. 
t1_dsjuzxq	1	*	Yeah their current president is Moon Jae-in. The former president was Park Geun-hye.

t1_dsi70rb	0	*	Newsflash : Not all right wingers hate Muslims or Immigrants.  Hi there.
t1_dsi1fif	0	*	Strange that right wing Islamic extremist cling to the left wing's welfare tit like no tomorrow. Are they just right wing because it's a religious belief?
t1_dsi72r7	0	*	He's actually pointing out the irony that the majority of this site is an echo chamber yet the majority of this site also references T_D as an echo chamber.  Pot calling the kettle black.
t1_dsfnod7	0	*	Where was that?
t1_dsfx2nz	1	*	Come on man, just because they are muslims doesn't mean they steal : D
t1_dseza1d	0	*	Better yet. Let them starve till they get home after school.
t1_dsfuid7	1	*	Compared to US school lunches, some French schools are basically 5 star restaurants. 
t1_dsgb9q9	0	*	Fair enough. As long as we ensure the rules apply to everyone.  https://www.google.com/amp/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/video-puts-muslim-bakeries-florists-in-gay-rights-/
t1_dsgimg6	0	*	How much do you pay for a small can of tuna over there
t1_dseud9j	0	*	It's unethical to eat vegetables. I don't think humans should be treated like this
t1_dsewbmv	0	*	Self services solve that issue generally with generally or a meat or fish option but not every school as it especially on the lower school levels.
t1_dsgawdv	1	*	Sure, not appeasing Islam by providing halal school means =\= oppression. 
t1_dseterw	0	*	Because for European non eating meat in unnatural...
t1_dses27u	0	*	I don't see how that is far-right terminology, but I respect your viewpoints. 
t1_dsercy9	0	*	Because most people like to eat meat?
t1_dsfun63	1	*	You mean it's NOT pizza day...okay I'll take the damn sandwich. 
t1_dsesxa2	0	*	So then the kid that can't eat pork can just say Hold the pork what's the issue?
t1_dtcgygs	0	*	> You can blame overpopulation and consumerism at the same time.   Not when the former deals 20% damage and the latter deals 80%.
t1_dtckbj9	1	*	Right 
t1_dtcqzep	1	*	Can you share some recommended reading on the topic?
t1_dtcvzkm	0	*	Well then whats the point of telling them to slow down meat consumption when theyre already slow?
t1_dtczu1q	1	*	Not even close to farm animals. 98% goes to farm animals
t1_dtcpdy5	1	*	Good point
t1_dtc6ca6	1	*	Clearly. The rich will be able to move and eat and stay cool, for a while. 
t1_dtejctn	1	*	Sorry, dont know the reddit lingo. 
t1_dtcoqqg	1	*	Even going part time, ie meat once a week helps a hell of a lot!

t1_dtcni39	0	*	literally just google it, bud. im not the one pulling shit out of my ass to insult vegans. if you actually read the article you will see that its about soy and corn to feed cattle
t1_dtcu7hn	1	*	Unfortunately, this is very accurate. 
t1_dtcpb63	0	*	You should be so proud of yourself for being such a morally superior person to the 98% of Americans who aren't vegetarians. Get over yourself. 
t1_dtcswca	0	*	https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/spain-spain-reached-record-levels-beef-and-pork-production-2015
t1_dtcl1tv	0	*	But... couldn't you just make something that had levels, but was open-air? Like a parking garage, basically?
t1_dtcrx06	0	*	Yeah, I mean its clear they are doing it because its cheaper. In part it may be because the government is giving the land away cheaply, which artificially makes it appealing. 
t1_dtecc3p	1	*	Thank you! 
t1_dtcsy6k	0	*	idk, not everyone browses reddit, thats the only source of that info for me
t1_dtcqrv0	1	*	Isa Does It is my favorite vegan cookbook!
t1_dtd0sjy	1	*	I don't know, I think the thought process of Eat less animals, so they eat less soy, so there's less economic incentive to deforest the Amazon is pretty straightforward. 
t1_dtcnfd7	1	*	Not a vegan but my wife and I make that burrito recipe all the time, so damn good! 
t1_dtcqgt5	0	*	...
t1_dtcp9u8	0	*	Unfortunately the average human mind is more attracted to apathy than reflecting on the grand consequences of their choices. It's just too hard of a pill to swallow :(
t1_dtcl403	1	*	I like your style. Maths. Got that s in there like a proper non-American. Nice.
t1_dtcvadl	1	*	Join our cult while we act superior and shit talk vegetarians for not being good enough.
t1_dtctrep	1	*	There's no shortage of food the issue is distribution and fallow feilds are important for the soil 
t1_dtddpla	1	*	I'm forever alone so it doesn't really matter.
t1_dtcraia	1	*	The thug kitchen recipes are good but the fucking writing style gets fucking grating very fucking quickly fucking fuck fuckity fuck.
t1_dtcllwe	1	*	Why don't you take a big step in signaling to your government that you want them to do that by reducing your own ecological impact? 
t1_dtcu5vl	1	*	Farmer here, apparently we need more fields to lay fallow, not making a profit.
t1_dtcs2gl	1	*	It is! I have almost cut in half how much meat I eat...still working on cutting down on cheese. 
t1_dtcuvms	0	*	Eh this replacement of meat with cheese thing feels inaccurate, I usually top meat with cheese. Lack of meat drives me to legumes, tofu, portobellos and eggplant. 
t1_dtcmz39	1	*	Yup
t1_dtdeoku	1	*	Yeah so while we are larger per capita consumers of meat, the Chinese drive the majority demand.
t1_dtck9iq	0	*	You do not understand the food chain at all.
t1_dtcxve1	0	*	If everybody cuts their meat consumption by half, which isn't really that tough a goal, that's the same as half of us going vegetarian.  Even cutting it down a little is a great step forward!
t1_dtcuz37	0	*	I'm not talking about race I'm talking about humans. All races are humans.
t1_dtck940	1	*	Would you rather enforce laws or put money in your pocket and let your grand children worry about the reprecussions
t1_dtcstv3	0	*	Whats the vegan where one only cuts out meat? Dairy and eggs are cool, and can't beat leather seats. 
t1_dte5a5x	1	*	Cool story bro
t1_dtcoqyi	1	*	[Here you go](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/holland-agriculture-sustainable-farming/)
t1_dtcpt06	1	*	Lula, sorry for typo. Sounds funny 
t1_dtcpvq9	0	*	Oh shoot, you don't get your meat from factory farms huh?  Do you get it from your friends uncle who treats all his livestock like family?
t1_dtck7ue	1	*	Soy Fiesta!
t1_dtcpfi3	1	*	Moroccan is also good.  Spicy and filling.  Sure they have a lot of meat dishes but you can replace the meat with chick peas...lots of veggie dishes too and they taste amazing.
t1_dtcr82k	1	*	You'd probably be surprised that overweight/obese vegans exist as well as incredibly built vegans. It's almost as if you can get all the nutrients and calories you could want from a vegan diet.
t1_dsulhoh	1	*	I think his point is that there is no need for a women's rights movement in a western country. Even if abortion is restricted, many women support that too so it's not really a women's rights issue.
t1_dsgc7zz	0	*	I will never claim the media to be 100% unbiased, but neither will I claim it to be Fake News.

t1_durjwpo	0	*	you can get AR-15 semi-autos in Canada
t1_dsm72gn	1	*	Cause he smells right? 
t1_dsylk41	1	*	This illegal tax break only applied to Apple anyway.
t1_dsy4rue	1	*	More than Ireland is, at least on this issue.
t1_dsxp8po	1	*	Is this why Ive been stuck with my Nokia phone for 19 years now? 
t1_dt3o7ji	0	*	> WHen was the last time a google or an apple came out of Europe?  Spotify, one of the worlds largest music streaming services 
t1_dsxs50v	0	*	Huh? I mean it certainly is the most popular phone.
t1_dsymlk0	0	*	What's wrong with Huawei? I've been eyeing one up for my next phone. Canadian doe.
t1_dt17vtm	1	*	All will have nukes, but all would also carry many more decoys than warheads.
t1_dt0pjd1	0	*	Maybe people could stop responding in short single sentances and actually make the time and effort for a proper reply?
t1_dt1gp54	1	*	Yeah. That's what it's for
t1_dt0ohrw	1	*	Yes. I read the article. And many like it. And many publications on the subject of nuclear strategy.
t1_dt1g8yq	1	*	Yay even more depressing!!!! :):) <3<3
t1_dsmy6t5	1	*	Woosh
t1_dsme1nw	1	*	That is true, almost like some people lack of common sense to see it.
t1_dslrp9t	1	*	> hes just human like the rest of us?  I think I'm aiming for a slightly higher bar.
t1_dskxtym	0	*	Mitt romneys was never president? If he was maybe that woulda come up.  It was both sides fault. You think an instigator cant get prosecuted under law? 
t1_dsmgm76	1	*	> When I was growing up the saying was  if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. Now it's be as rude, mean, evil as one can because the US president condones it. Fuck manners!
t1_dsl7ewj	1	*	a colleague of mine said the same thing earlier, and no lie, you both are right! They know it!
t1_dskyque	1	*	Lines from the poem that was written purely to make money. Seems American enough.
t1_dsn5wi5	0	*	Agreed, there are many shitty things the current administration's pulling, but the DACA bill, like Title IX, is total bullshit from the Dem side.
t1_dsla6ap	0	*	Lmfao little testy there huh?
t1_dsmaq79	1	*	Well we don't know what he said exactly. It was as far as I know a closed door meeting. 
t1_dsmd9pl	1	*	Finally!  A man of honor, you sir, are a scholar and a gentleman, salute!
t1_dsqldl1	1	*	Well, immigration is actually a fantastic way to help those countries. Overseas remittance from immigrants has a very significant effect last time I checked. 
t1_dsmqa2l	0	*	That's kazikistan 
t1_dsl6ut8	1	*	Damn, he's fast. 
t1_dsqlgcq	1	*	Surely what you're talking about has no relation to neoliberalism? 
t1_dslx31h	0	*	Youre right. In that case I can assume that Obama never said anything offensive during a meeting.  Grow up. These are grown humans interacting in stressful environments. It wasnt a public address.
t1_dslvhh3	1	*	Hey you got a second?
t1_dsldrov	1	*	Wow, that's some grade-A derp right there.
t1_dsmqwnr	0	*	I do find it rather hard to believe yes.
t1_dsm88mp	1	*	Norway has a very different culture and too.  It's clearly not about culture. 
t1_dt2j4cr	0	*	>Are you sure he just doesn't have a pathological hate for the US?  I think  u/Evilutionist does   As if there aren't any Kopinos, Japinos and Filipinos ditched by their sexed fathers.

t1_duua1z9	0	*	Maybe so, but I guess we will never know. 
t1_duubz8h	0	*	They even made up stories about Russia invading Ukraine.  I hear CNN is even saying that the Russians speak their own language called Russian.  Will their lies and propaganda know no bounds?
t1_duub3ib	1	*	Yes. 
t1_duq3v2x	0	*	Still get on better than some other migrant from the ME I imagine. Same language is a good start. 
t1_dupazl6	0	*	Seems that way from what I'm reading. I don't understand this move. Imagine the shoe on the other foot....but here in the US. Oy vey
t1_duq2mex	0	*	I'm sorry you're not able to understand the nuanced situation at hand.
t1_dupz7s5	0	*	I think you might wanna get tested for mental retardation.
t1_duq4j7f	0	*	Exactly! The original land is NOT in the state it was from what I understand. 
t1_dupsegi	1	*	If the land was taken within living memory, yes.
t1_duq4odg	1	*	Because 70% of these people aren't decendents of those who lost their land, and you're naive to think every Jew received what was taken from them.
t1_dulepvu	0	*	Anglo Irish agreement doesn't see it that way.
t1_dsqu8aj	0	*	I see some dumb misuse of apostrophes, but this is among the most egregious I've seen.
t1_du30j1o	1	*	We are more prone to thinking that he is the boogeyman that Russian propoganda uses to try to justify invading their neighnors.
t1_du2rpuh	1	*	Awesome, thanks! 
t1_du3xgac	0	*	I believe Russian government will continue to be a dick. I should just say Putin, rather.
t1_du32456	1	*	Draaaaagggoooooo!!!!

t1_du37yxk	0	*	Quit making stupid jokes about serious issues lmao
t1_du31ah9	0	*	It's illegal, and you can't use it during OS if you don't have a corrupt government provided doctor to falsely diagnose you with it, like all Norweigan skiers do without consequences. 
t1_du35dez	1	*	I'm about as far from Trump as it is possible to get, thanks. 
t1_dt9auib	0	*	for safety. Presumably to keep people from using it as an exit or an entrance. Truly stupid.
t1_du4cyw2	1	*	I have problems controlling the one I have already.
t1_duusore	1	*	Yeah, it is much better to let them crash into a bus on the highway, takes away the shock of discovering them dead...  Self-driving cars might even bring them to a hospital before it's too late.
t1_duqa08g	1	*	I doubt you really want the army looking for drugs.  Hell if anything give them a break to rest and retrain after so much war.
t1_dtsdpp5	0	*	No, you get up and go to bed an hour earlier during DST, that's why it's still light(er) outside.
t1_dtrkv3h	0	*	I like you.
t1_dtsgch9	0	*	It was 20 years ago. Twenty Superbowls.   Nobody remembers except you and me. 
t1_dtrsesp	1	*	Thats just nonsense. And if time traveling were even a minor issue in this regard it wouldnt be extraordinarily popular among retirees. 
t1_dtrhs8e	0	*	Sorry, you're right. I connected it with the OP in my mind.
t1_dts2qa2	1	*	To be fair half of the length of your country is above the arctic circle...
t1_dtrwtf6	1	*	Oh yeah, I agree. Using UTC +-/X hours would be much better than having DST, BST, CEST and a lot of other names that hardly anyone can remember what times they actually represent.
t1_dttjj3s	1	*	You should be more clear in what you write.    You just added in that you want more daylight in the morning. 
t1_dts8oz7	0	*	You can add UTC today if you need it to be free of ambiguity. Also, youd lose the ability to talk about local time. Like 9 in the morning, where ever you are.
t1_dtrvkr8	1	*	I commute home in pitch black, I'd rather have sun in the evenings than the mornings, when I spend all my time either asleep or getting ready for work.  
t1_ds7aolm	1	*	lmao, hes a social democrat at least that's what he is openly, which means he does not support the overturning of capitalism but merely the regulation of it.
t1_ds6dk2p	0	*	Why is a unified army a bad thing? - Serious question? Would have thought it would increase collaboration (we're already in NATO) and reduce procurement costs.
t1_ds7gp1p	1	*	Weapons of mass destruction?
t1_ds6mlgo	1	*	A 2/3 majority requirement most likely 
t1_dte745a	1	*	/r/ShitAmericansSay
t1_dtn7ynr	1	*	My stance is that I would assume the claim is true unless the Democrat members of the committee directly dispute it.  Then I take it with a grain or two of salt. 
t1_ducohgu	0	*	You're an idiot. I'm not even American. 
t1_ducundo	1	*	I'd say he's qualified in that he's exceptionally good at executing the plan the administration gives to him, he wasn't hired because of his judgement on public interest.
t1_ducm5lt	0	*	Just a fascist then. Cool, carry on. 
t1_dujubzg	0	*	Really? You think refugees are like Ottoman armies? Can you explain?
t1_dsrsdd9	0	*	Sounds like an absolute shit storm.  
t1_dsknze0	1	*	That's a good point. Hmm, I'll think about it.
t1_dse2bif	1	*	Now Trump said yesterday he is willing to talk to Kim Jong Un directly.  So you believe everything this senile flip flopper says?
t1_dse1qe8	0	*	China has clearly stated if the US first strikes NK it will defend its ally.  I am glad you are on the front lines. Since you want war so bad you should be the one to fight it.
t1_dtam54a	1	*	I like your opinion AND your username lmao 
t1_dt9zuj8	0	*	Any videos that aren't from clickbait?
t1_dta2uw8	1	*	Yeah, nail on the head. They'll report facts at some point but most, by far, is opinion. People can't watch 24/7, so I think most are exposed to far more opinion than the facts
t1_dt9veqd	1	*	Except in 44 countries where anyone might want to question something.
t1_dta22iv	1	*	This. 
t1_dt924hb	1	*	People also say good music is dead.  Like journalism, it's just a matter of knowing where to look. You might have to dig more these days, but it's still there.
t1_dtsub99	0	*	It wouldn't be Tsarist era wealth, more like Gas company nepotism and monopolies IIRC.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarch
t1_ds7pj73	1	*	The country was rich but the people were not. There was huge wealth inequality and major corruption.  Hence the support for socialist populism.  Sadly that just made things worse.
t1_ds83b1d	0	*	> it does not fullfil the definition of a communist/socialist sate  It absolutely does. Go read on what the chavista government has done to private industry and production.  
t1_ds8apzf	0	*	Over 70% of Venezuela companies are private. Private companies destroy food to sabotage their own economy, all to pressure Maduro.
t1_ds7gqjr	0	*	What are you talking about? In my province welfare rates don't come close to covering monthly rent, and housing that targets homeless people has several year wait lists. 
t1_ds7w49o	0	*	Replace hurricane with disease and you've got the plot to The Division!
t1_ds7qqwl	1	*	Did France seize private factories and nationalizes them?
t1_ds7qo7n	1	*	Not real communism because it failed before it was finished? Nice try, once the free market is dead then capitalism is dead.
t1_ds7dj1g	1	*	Yeah Im lucky to have parents that fed me, so Im good, but I do have friends that live with that reality.  Having shit parents can really fuck you up and make everything hard for no reason.

t1_ds1czx3	0	*	Make his room a box that's not quite tall enough to stand up in and not quite wide enough to lay out flat in.
t1_dtnjhew	1	*	Terrorism has a political or ideological motive. The ideology doesn't have to be religious.
t1_dtnuuxh	0	*	Is that what the article is about? I didn't see the word Christianity in the article at all or any mention of a church. 
t1_dtmmzhz	0	*	Ahahaha, sorry, that just drives me up the wall. I see it all the time and have never said anything about it and finally I just snapped. Just like where do these cunts come from. So unnecessary.
t1_dspnjq7	0	*	That still makes no sense, if I had a cousin who went to a protest and ended up on the receiving end of riot control measures I'm not going to make it my mission to slap cops on video.

t1_dta1c3z	0	*	> As far as I'm aware his polling numbers have been going up since the election.  I just checked, and this statement is 100% accurate.  What polling figures are you using that shows a drop?

t1_dti05fs	1	*	Seriously?  Have you been following any news AT ALL in the last year or so?
t1_dtxh8qm	0	*	Right? I'm from a third world country who just moved to the US for school. It's amazing just how much everyone underestimates US in pretty much every aspect

t1_dsvdts2	0	*	Then I guess the leaseholders should be suing the manufacturers then to recoup costs? 
t1_du0j4w0	0	*	It's pointless when you can present your argument without bringing them up at all.
t1_dseypnf	1	*	Plus, workers overseas tend to send money back to their families, giving a nice cash influx to the economy.
t1_du88w99	1	*	Oh I do. I was just wondering why he was asking.

t1_dst83td	1	*	Could be one of the semicolons in a for loop definition.  The third clause is optional in some languages, and it would get past linters at the very least.
t1_dstiymb	1	*	Youd think they would dispel the minor illusion before we eat their dicks. Guess not...
t1_dsthq4e	1	*	And thats fine - laws are made by legislators, not citizens. I cant think of any reason why we should not legislate for the least level of animal suffering possible though.

t1_dutyb8b	0	*	Trump is a president who can be easily manipulated by flattery and is incapable of executing a coherent policy agenda. What else xecs that then weak?
t1_dust5m3	1	*	Exactly, hence your comment about it on a page full of comments about it on an article about it among tens of other articles about it.   *No one fucking cares!*

t1_dutx3a8	1	*	It's easy to get over a wall.
t1_dushuhh	0	*	> And apparently, the price of the wall would be far cheaper than the current costs of policing and dealing with the border.  You're going to need to provide a source for that.

t1_dusoxdl	1	*	DAE not really understand the uncomfortable ness around the word moist?
t1_dusipm1	1	*	Reagan was not a moderate. He should be reviled by any who hold even centrist views. As a lefty, I fucking hate how his image has been rehabilitated.
t1_dusk2vf	1	*	[error]

t1_dusithx	1	*	Damn elves
t1_dutpc0r	1	*	It's very shortsighted of Americans to think they can compete in this global economy with that attitude. Now is not a good time to insulate. The 33% hive mind is running our country amok.

t1_dusjwtt	1	*	Not at all actually. And since when are approval ratings the same as election predictions?

t1_dusklrw	0	*	Just want to say, love the username. Fblthp was the best thing to come out of RtR.
t1_duspp23	1	*	This, but but
t1_dush9w7	1	*	US govt declares war against ally would definitely make for an interesting headline.   It would then be followed by All other UN countries impose economic sanctions on US.
t1_dusx9ua	0	*	it's hilarious, or at least it would be _if there weren't actual numbskulls who see what's going on and still somehow think he's doing a good job_  :(
t1_dusuuvq	1	*	Oh so youve bought 25 years of republican propaganda. 
t1_dusiodf	1	*	Reagan policy worship is literally the genesis for today's GOP and its voters. Like the guy below me says, reap what you sow.
t1_duslxgb	0	*	Tariffs is putting handgun in your mouth and shooting it lots populist idiots on right and left. 
t1_dusoufj	1	*	Cause of racism...
t1_dusjpn0	1	*	Because the US has a border force thats on the brink of rebelling and marching on Washington to instal the president of Mexico?
t1_dusuddb	1	*	They can't think for themselves.
t1_dutp2ep	1	*	How about a very small wall, shaped like a square and with Trump in the middle?
t1_dusm35j	1	*	Mexico gets billions from the US this way. In relation, the US gets almost a million. 
t1_dusi6ob	1	*	You don't know what a tariff is
t1_dusif9r	0	*	When I was in Italy and Trump was on the news, everyone in the bar groaned. Probably flashbacks of Berlusconi, but I'm sure other countries feel the same way
t1_dusqtkw	1	*	Lol. Banning bots on /r/redacted would severely curtail posts.
t1_duu85ys	1	*	Those aren't children. It saves children from being born to unprepared or unwilling parents who cant or wont give them the life they deserve.
t1_dushma7	0	*	Does that mean raising taxes on US corporations is a tax on the Americans buying their products? A regressive one at that? Should we just drop all corporate taxes?

t1_dutc2dj	1	*	More likely they move to China
t1_dusi2ir	1	*	If something is picked up and used regularly by a hate group, it is then associated with a hate group. It doesn't have to originate from them to be connected to them.
t1_dut9gio	1	*	I answered dozens of people. Sending me 11 desperate messages doesn't earn you the right to a reply. Sorry bud. I spent a couple hours in the hive last night. That was plenty. 
t1_dushd5x	1	*	Trump supporters parrot every lie he tells. I dont see why this would be different. He doesnt have to fool *everyone* into thinking Mexico paid for it, just the people that already/still support him. 
t1_dsopf94	0	*	Its sarcasm. Please read [this](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSBRE9AB00I20131112)
t1_dsppj4n	1	*	I'm sorry I thought you were the Saudi who doesn't like that.
t1_dspgqsy	1	*	They'd probably keep doing so regardless. Countries who go to war generally don't care much about how this affects their public image.
t1_dt9l3q7	1	*	This!
t1_dt9kkop	0	*	If is your ancestors? What. I don't need to leave the country I was born in to respect the wishes of the aboriginal people. No one is suggesting that.

t1_dulk8kw	1	*	I'm so scared of small risks.  Best to just hide.
t1_dula9ay	0	*	Duterte didn't order the murder of innocent people, it's corruted policemen who did what they did and they must be punished accordingly... do not blame someone for the actions of another person.
t1_dul4njb	0	*	It makes me laugh to read about him because he's very far away
t1_dulbhk3	1	*	Yep...it's one of the reasons why I'd rather just be in at least a semi committed relationship or nothing at all. 
t1_dul73hx	0	*	Doing it here in (South) Africa as well. Mobile data is expensive. Free though with Facebook as the launch pad. Insidious.

t1_dule6fy	1	*	just took a year off from working.  Will look for a job here though in a few months.
t1_dul5jqu	1	*	Theyre all victims of his massive, massive, humongous troll propaganda army.
t1_dumcqwp	0	*	Sure it did. It may have been believable or anything. But realism isn't exactly one of their strong suits of that movie. lol

t1_dul4cel	0	*	morally evil people in power should be shot in the head. 
t1_dul2cfi	0	*	Because most of us Filipinos with decent grasp of the language probably  don't have to work those kind of jobs to begin with.
t1_dul3a6u	1	*	Yeah. But the person makes it sound like you only need US money to rebuild the country which is far from the case.
t1_duktqiz	1	*	Probably. I live in the city and almost everyone here is circumcised around birth. I only knew one (previously) uncircumcised guy and he also got his around 10.
t1_dul70wu	1	*	its not that hard unless you only want to date beautiful women (like most of reddit)

t1_dv2j9b0	1	*	Wow how sassy of you... 
t1_dv2p184	1	*	Yeah my sarcasm also makes it easier for you guys to dismiss me instead of actually thinking of counter arguments.
t1_dv2vapc	1	*	Commenting just this will often get you down voted on any topic, even by people who agree.
t1_dv378u8	1	*	And after 9/11 most Americans wanted to bomb Afghanistan to hell. 
t1_dskewra	1	*	IMO that's the problem too. That the (ex-)president of Mexico doesn't like Mexico being called a shithole country is irrelevant. He's responsible for its current state. He should look elsewhere.
t1_dskdh92	0	*	They deserve to be treated as equal humans. Do you denigrate all those less fortunate than you and accept denigration from your economic superiors happily?

t1_dv2rix4	0	*	It's funny because you're calling me stupid yet you're trying to find other purposes for a nuclear-powered missile-defense evading missile.  There is no other purpose.
t1_dv0zhyy	0	*	> Putin would love nuclear war  No he wouldn't.
t1_dv199jb	0	*	I don't see how Crimea fucked Russia over... It's their only opening to the Med without which Russian markets would be suffering due to the loss of naval commerce.
t1_dv111ll	1	*	It sounds like satire but sexual frustration from beta male types is literally a serious issue and has costed countless lives more than the average Joe would think, it's an epidemic like obesity.

t1_dv0wkoi	1	*	Oh, just so an accident can happen that would kill everything? Right.
t1_dv14qwz	1	*	We also have to keep in mind the defense shield we have right now isnt perfect. No way is it stopping multitudes if ICBMs. Its still business as usual
t1_dv2az96	1	*	Canada is the 2nd largest country.
t1_dtaj428	0	*	I wonder what % of those sites have shut down...

t1_dt9yxwo	0	*	Yeah, with no light pollution, the sky is only like 20% black.  There are way more stars than there are not-stars.

t1_dudgddm	1	*	Thank you for taking the time. I agree with most of what you said, except the last bit. Turkey would not be acting alone against NATO.

t1_ds82iok	1	*	So the problem is simply making up a new menu? That doesn't sound plausible, does it? My explanation sounds plausible; yours doesn't. Im more likely to be correct.
t1_dtu82cu	1	*	Except if you call someone the wrong pronoun. ILLEGAL!
t1_dtvmubt	1	*	your comment is simply not true. 
t1_dtv9nd2	1	*	It was over 11 million, the 6 million was just the Jewish victims.
t1_dtvbwe4	1	*	I was agreeing with you.
t1_dturgik	0	*	It has nothing to do with the law. The law talks about pinning Nazi crimes on Polish people, not about the crimes Polish people committed against Polish Jewry.
t1_dtvm8g8	1	*	> Polish death camps = Death camps in Poland.  That's like calling the US military bases in Japan Japanese military bases, just because they're inside Japan doesn't mean they belong to them.
t1_dtub37j	0	*	The potential to be jailed for writing/saying something is a great example of why Americans have the views on private gun ownership they do.  Food for thought. 
t1_dtv7mbt	0	*	>Exactly. Poland should pay Israel compensation  Imagine being ***this*** stupid
t1_dtu5mi4	1	*	That is relevant.
t1_dtxwalb	0	*	I didn't state otherwise. But still the law is suppressing historical research.
t1_dtvbk4m	0	*	So it's a single case in which they apologised and admitted their mistake.   Still weird you need a law for that.
t1_dtva4j3	1	*	Yes
t1_dtuc8ic	0	*	I don't think Poland has statues of SS officers in order to make jews feel uncomfortable. 
t1_dtvefcp	1	*	That's not exclusionary with at least some poles being complicit in the holocaust.  edit: If it's unclear, the sentence was supposed to mean supporting crimes, not supporting nazis
t1_dt4z5bs	1	*	You've obviously never heard of the Banach-Tarski paradox.
t1_dt4jt5e	1	*	*I'll build my own white house, with hookers and blackjack!*
t1_dtv6wui	0	*	The CAS decision has everything to do with it. It's based off of the evidence uncovered from Rodchenkov, the architect, and WADA verifying those claims. 
t1_dtus1sa	0	*	Considering yourself to be more important than others is not a valid argument at all. 
t1_dtuh6hx	1	*	When I hit my Juul I get a little retarded so YMMV on that. Coffee generally makes me sharper.  Edit: A lot retarded.

t1_du9f34y	0	*	Statistically speaking, I'm not wrong. But practically, I wouldn't mind being wrong as long as it didn't mean us being wiped out by a significantly more technologically advanced civilization.
t1_du9ywf3	0	*	No, it's absolutely not a ponzi scheme. You need to check the definition of that word.
t1_du8xb8o	0	*	Almost makes me wish I had a fallback GPU like a 1050ti or something so I could use that while I turn my current 1080 into a 1080ti when prices become more reasonable again.

t1_dsahuf5	0	*	Youve got that backwards.  Trust me, Ive worked closely with British Sugar. Most the UKs sugar is home grown from sugar beet.
t1_dsak5v0	1	*	The coke with cane sugar is generally in glass bottles (in the US) which gives a different flavor. Im not saying its the sugar that makes the difference, but they ***do*** taste different.

t1_dtalnem	0	*	Thinking that the rest of the world shouldn't care about US politics and their president is kind of being ignorant about the US position in the world. How do you see that as reasonable?

t1_dsbe2ni	0	*	The fuck you talking about. There is no racism towards mizrahim in Israel  Source: I am one
t1_dscgkju	1	*	Seems like they are just pedophiles trying to abuse people's trust. Especially since what they are doing is death penalty worthy by their religion.
t1_dsefjui	0	*	We meaning the losing team?
t1_dseflmg	1	*	Yeah he just said it.
t1_dsfymih	0	*	i don't believe you.  your account is very new, so you're a troll who lies.
t1_dseg18g	1	*	Yeah well if I hear about some general Mattis on the media I'm not gonna know who the fuck they're talking about. At least this way I can identify him as that general named Mad Dog
t1_dsehyn0	1	*	I see you havent met rapey steve yet..... he isnt allowed near women folk in public or private 
t1_dsef0td	1	*	Even if he doesn't like the nickname, I still want to see a Mad Dog 2020 campaign. #1 Perfect Campaign Slogan and #2 he would be the best president in generations.
t1_dsebiud	1	*	When millions of people protest it works. And when it doesn't, thats what you have that amendment you care so much about for.
t1_dsewe37	1	*	you accussed me of not reading an article i'm literally not allowed to read, don't back track now.

t1_dsec2uq	1	*	it's actually defense but sometimes shit gets broken and people get killed in carrying out that objective
t1_dsefrnv	1	*	Saying that Kim Jong Un is crazy is a lazy conclusion at best
t1_dseg4zw	1	*	Nobody seems to care about the Iraqis that were killed during an illegal war started by war criminals that are still walking around free
t1_dsee919	0	*	You take a picture of Papua New Guinea and load it into Photoshop. Then remove the background and add a transparent layer and save it as a .png 
t1_dskm0uq	1	*	If I had a very vested interest in this satellite that is also what I would say.  If I knew I could recover fragments before anyone else you bet your ass I'd be all over it. Armed and ready 
t1_dul7j8w	1	*	It was actually pretty good. They did look at bits and pieces of Catholicism. A good 1/5 of classes are meditation sessions too
t1_duladsl	0	*	Western culture does not separate religion. An understanding of Christianity and its roots are very important to understanding western society.  It influenced everything public and private. 
t1_dul9wlt	1	*	I depends on the school, however. Some schools' religion classes aren't far off from being just Catholicism classes.
t1_duliacb	1	*	There use to be a website called godulike that was like an encyclopedia of religions that had beaucoup listings of religions, but I can't find it now.
t1_dumjdns	1	*	Hardly, for the cultures that entwine culture and religion together, you teach them as one, for the cultures that don't, you teach culture separately. 
t1_dumi62i	0	*	What part of Ireland are you in, I think that there is a bit of a conflict with Protestants in the north.
t1_duld9ra	0	*	to be fair, a scientist is an ok fallback choice if you have none with a philosophy degree available. 
t1_dulm2h8	1	*	Which is understandable in certain countries.
t1_dt130h9	0	*	They don't charge them. It said they refuse them insurance.
t1_dt7hgv0	1	*	I mean, didn't kim's brother get busted running around Disneyland, removing him from succession? If kim didn't want to run the north, he could have just done something similar.
t1_dsz190u	1	*	...That's literally their reason for wanting to withhold it: for their own benefit.
t1_dulcm4s	0	*	If rights are important to the Palestinians why don't they give any to their women? It's a simple question.
t1_duli9uf	1	*	What does that have to do with anything?
t1_dukt387	1	*	Can you liquify and freeze it to store the energy for later using long loops for storage? Edit: Oops you already said that i shouldn't skip so many words when reading.
t1_dt90foy	1	*	>supposed  And the Olympics Committee's do not give one shit about that anymore, just look at the last two Olympic games and the state of things in the host countries
t1_dsdl8f6	1	*	Erdogan going; OFF WITH HIS HEAD.  He's done it in the past, and we have evidence of it.  We even have footage of Erdogan giving his bodyguards the order to beat American protesters on US soil. 
t1_dsde6ho	0	*	If a syrian gets to european soil, then they came from syria, not turkey.
t1_dsdbq9s	0	*	He was shot at in ... wait for it ... Germany!
t1_dsdcm9q	1	*	This is German version of Thanks Obama!
t1_dsdl3zi	1	*	He thinks he already is.
t1_dsetv79	1	*	Nah it's not that bad. No one gets lynched or mobbed, well it's very unlikely. Unless you're at a protest or something but I guess that's no different from most of the rest of the world. 
t1_dsdofqe	0	*	Evidently the sarcasm in my comment wasn't understood. My apologies. 
t1_dsdnw1l	1	*	Care to link the news you were reading?

t1_dv23lgu	1	*	 Bruh...
t1_dv2xah6	1	*	The White army had lost moral order for a fight. The momentum was for either the Red army or Black army, 100 years back in the region.
t1_dv2yiae	1	*	it's literally just racists.
t1_dv2ymzz	1	*	And yet, it wasn't. Republicans chose Trump over the others. 
t1_dv26zlc	1	*	Sorry.
t1_dv1vmhz	0	*	Source is history books and the internet.
t1_dv39r87	1	*	Ah. Thanks.
t1_duj7gcm	1	*	Not like the Philippines is any better. The courts are corrupt there too
t1_duj7fjj	0	*	Hmm, aren't they doing something in Africa as well?
t1_duj0jlo	1	*	And a country with thousands of extra-judicial killings is better?
t1_duixpd8	1	*	Fair call. 
t1_du8amyu	0	*	Impoverished people in America are typically overweight- the horrors of capitalism.
t1_dtm9cwc	1	*	I did not heard the cut in half one. I've heard they are loud and it ruins the view. 
t1_du70dow	1	*	Trump's proposed budget he released yesterday increases Israel funding by 200 million.    
t1_dtf3wov	0	*	Wrong, Surgical Steel...i.e. Stainless Steel is magnetic. When initially created it is not but when bent and cut it gains magnetic properties.
t1_dtelaj3	1	*	Yes, the super conductor magnet is remains so even without power. The only way to quench the magnet is to release all 1000-1400 liters helium, at and obviously really high expense.
t1_dtfeg0z	1	*	Why narrate something if you're not going to just record your voice?  Literally any reason or answer for that can be rebuffed with then don't do it.
t1_dtv6u9d	1	*	Big strong Russian boy. Very impressive...
t1_dsae4go	1	*	I see you've flown United before.
t1_dst6uim	1	*	Yeah, you need to pass the Intelligence check 
t1_dst05ef	1	*	Yeah, compared to EQ, IQ is a very stable and quantifiable measure.
t1_dssbqx9	0	*	**LOW CASE LETTERS?! IS THIS HOW YOU QUOTE YOUR KING?!**
t1_dss382p	0	*	Proof he was not a benevolent being.
t1_dst7ffp	0	*	If even one other planet has life on it, we are all aliens.
t1_dsthfbm	0	*	Yea, I did the same thing at least in regards to the Brother Laser (I got a monochrome one).  Fuck HP and the shit they purposefully do to make you constantly buy ink.
t1_dss9prt	1	*	We wouldn't be printing them out rather than saving them on disk, though. Disk implies the mid-90's or before
t1_dstf9d4	0	*	Why don't you invent a way how to make other people smarter, then?
t1_dssxbgw	1	*	> . It's sad to realize that so much potential gets wasted because people love to get wasted  Its sad that you think that's what it is. 
t1_dsse6c6	0	*	Generally intelligence is referred to the speed in which you acquire knowledge and skills, not your capacity or your existing knowledge.
t1_dsrmwof	0	*	smdh
t1_dss6ffa	0	*	Some people with high IQ's dont relinquish there responsibility to the human race, no, they embrace it....and utterly help destroy it. 
t1_dsr2jew	0	*	Funniest conservatives querelously quaffing quince-juice quietly from quilted quarter-cups
t1_dsauy3v	1	*	So in your mind is it unconstitutional to show my ID to buy a gun? Thats a right that I have. 
t1_dsb1y9k	1	*	Bullshit.  Our country has an illegal immigration problem.  Proving who you are and that you have a right to vote needs to be mandatory.
t1_dsbj81c	1	*	Exactly, people never think about the other side that have wanted America to stand up for Israel in the UN for years
t1_dsav4ej	0	*	In SC you can get an ID only for free. Why do you liberals assume poor and minority people are too dumb to get an ID?
t1_dsvzgon	0	*	They're talking about performance enhancing drugs, not marijuana
t1_dsvxegd	1	*	I know more than one person that hasn't (my ex girlfriend included). 
t1_dsw5ykv	1	*	This was my thought exactly
t1_dswj29b	1	*	Sure this is all Western propaganda!
t1_dswz19j	1	*	So the right-wing talking points are just as incorrect, misleading, and stupid as ever. Thanks for the heads up! 
t1_dsw25fr	1	*	And the Russians continue to love that shit today. (The Russians meaning Russian government dis-info and propaganda arms.)
t1_dsw4rfj	1	*	KGB was dissolved in 1991. Its called FSB.
t1_dsvuxsx	0	*	That didnt look like a joke, it looked like the ramblings of a middle aged virgin.     Kind regards, Reddit
t1_dsvwjd2	0	*	Haha, you edited your post to change the wording but I read it wrong.  It's ok to admit that you're wrong on the internet.
t1_dsxeuji	1	*	Sit down. This is gonna take some time to explain...
t1_dswemgi	1	*	From small animals, not horses. You hold a cup on a stick and wait for them to pee. 
t1_dsw6jxh	1	*	It's the deterrent factor. Just like if North Korea were to get rid of their nukes that regime wouldn't last a month.
t1_dsw8zjh	0	*	That we are being fed an anti-Russia narrative. It's painfully obvious.  That's not to say Russia is perfect or even good, but it's certainly not the Satan spawn it's portrayed as.
t1_dswdz2o	1	*	Amputee gets prosthetic wheels to replace lost limbs, becomes real life Teen Turbo, destroys Kasey Kahne on final lap, wins Daytona.  I'd watch.
t1_dswfprh	1	*	I prefer the snatch.
t1_dsx13fa	1	*	Wait holdup, those fuckers had a KGB squad break into a facility and swap samples?

t1_dsdayhk	0	*	Did you know that most Redditors don't even read the articles and just rush to comment?
t1_dsd50yz	0	*	Er what? As far as I know that doesn't happen. At least not in the UK.
t1_duggu0c	1	*	> Israeli-~~Arab~~ Iranian   in this case. 
t1_duggc3o	1	*	They can't fight a country that doesn't exist. 
t1_dtbz29o	0	*	Did you not read what I wrote? The core module is already being finished. It will launch next *year*. By the time the ISS will be decommissioned, Tiangong 3 will be there for a stopgap measure. 
t1_dtbx434	1	*	Reality is left leaning. Sometime the truth really hits the trumpeters hard. 
t1_dtaz0al	1	*	She did get more votes by a fairly large margin.
t1_dtmzyop	1	*	Unfortunately. 
t1_dtncdqt	0	*	Selling an inordinate number of shares the day before a new tax policy was announced? Sounds like tax dodging to me. 
t1_dss6q8d	1	*	RETURN THE SLAAAB.
t1_dssez30	1	*	Well yeah, the raiding ended when the Khanate was destroyed. Not sure of the exact year but it was a long time ago.
t1_dss7ynv	1	*	Very similar.
t1_ds72v8j	1	*	Dude. I didn't say it was wrong. The other commenter was saying that this account doesn't have any posts or comments until now, and I explained that's because the OP deletes his posts.
t1_dt2rsc5	0	*	Dont ask why one should care and then get triggered when you get a accurate response.   
t1_dt2kl8n	1	*	I think he's probably referring more to the daily scandals since before he even took office rather than the one good example you've given. I mean you can't possibly have not heard of those, right?
t1_dujef6n	0	*	Well geez, what am I supposed to go into specifically?
t1_dsgozed	1	*	You get a drone!  *You* get a drone!  EVERYBODY gets a drone!
t1_dx9k7jo	0	*	Yh soz its late and I'm going through a GCSE rabbit whole 
t1_dtax84r	0	*	I mean you kid but I've met people who'd take that as an actual stance. My opinion is just as valid as yours except it isn't an opinion-based question
t1_dtp088x	1	*	ace doesn't either.
t1_dtp5ck0	1	*	Take a look around, look around.
t1_ds2r20l	1	*	We will always **dab** on haters, in 2018 too.

t1_dsrh9xd	0	*	Where is a source for that? I don't give a damn about PETA, just want to know if that's verifiable by source.
t1_dsm227p	1	*	Slaves to a foreign dictator instead. Cool.
t1_dsdrcyv	1	*	I respect that. lol 
t1_dsdmxnu	0	*	That's a bad assumption. Because someone points out hypocrisy, you cannot logically assume they can't defend their point, just because they recognize the cognitive dissonance of the opposing party.
t1_dsdnuz4	0	*	I don't know about that. We got genocided again about 70 years ago and we still haven't been able to shut up about it.
t1_dsdt7ml	0	*	Some of them maybe, but many I think are purely indoctrinated at this point. The administration and others really did a bang up job with their propaganda
t1_dse9wo5	1	*	I'll just have them write me 400,000 25$ checks.
t1_dsdob4g	1	*	There are multiple countries that I cannot visit because I had an Israeli stamp on my US passport.  
t1_dse2qpf	0	*	I agree that it makes sense to do it that, but what I have a problem with is people making those decisions profiting from it.
t1_dsdtx12	0	*	Lol i can never win..i say both are untrustworthy and corrupted and its still not good enough.

t1_dsdpwbk	1	*	*nice*
t1_dsdyk9x	1	*	Oh no doubt, the people of Gaza are living in an open air prison. That's a fact all sides can agree upon.
t1_dseqzgk	0	*	It's almost like the POPULACE went with the candidate who won the POPULAR vote.
t1_dsdsrxm	1	*	terrorist isn't an objective term and shouldn't be mistaken for one  resistance usually is terrorism, the kind we like though 
t1_dsdq1sn	1	*	Yes, because the president is orange /s
t1_dsemv6n	1	*	If a protest/general strike ends up being bipartisan even better. If people rise up in unison against the government, they will fall.
t1_dsdqwna	1	*	Just give the guy a debit card to a bank account.   Easy. 
t1_dsdun5t	1	*	sorry, I meant to imply just that I don't want anyone doing it, trump most of all for sure. screw him.  
t1_dsdlfpc	1	*	At least better than ballsack eyes
t1_dsdpl17	1	*	Those out of power vs those in.
t1_dse084p	1	*	Dems are either complicit or incompetent. No reason to trust them 
t1_dse5t3a	1	*	This man contracts....
t1_dsdv96q	1	*	The government writing their own laws on what's illegal for them and what's not, WCGW
t1_dsdomwf	1	*	Wow that's scummy
t1_dsdy6zu	1	*	Yeah.   Previous president's maybe.
t1_dsdwjrm	1	*	> It is absolute insanity  Absolute inanity, too.
t1_dsdpvfi	0	*	Right! But millions of dollars and we have to prove quid pro quo?

t1_dse2tno	1	*	There are precious few at ease   With moral ambiguities.   So we just pretend they don't exist!   -Wicked
t1_dsdp08i	0	*	I was about to write a wall of text disputing you, but if you cannot understand the irony of that statement  then your obviously not worth my time...
t1_dsdwxl1	0	*	Yup. Both sides are guilty of some heinous shit, but one side is worse. Plenty worse, in fact.
t1_dsdrfd1	0	*	Clinton was less swampy. I mean, she had more establishment swamp on her, sure, but Trump and his camp simply have no respect for ethics or norms, and they generate swamp to unprecedented degrees. 
t1_dsdoznv	0	*	After WWII there were tons of terrorist democratically voted in all over Europe. 
t1_dsdpod4	0	*	Didn't an Israeli or Arabian government just give him a ton of gifts not long ago? About the time he touched the light orb?? Was a golden knife or some crap, some rugs and who knows what.
t1_dse1sim	0	*	Charity
t1_dsdx746	1	*	Arabs and blacks make up a huge part of the population and unless they provoke the military (Palestinians sending bombs to schools) they get along fine 
t1_dsdx7wr	1	*	Hell, some Israeli politicians were terrorists. Where do I even [Begin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin)? (pun intended)
t1_dsdwp90	0	*	Really?! You are okay with open, naked corruption? Like, shrug and say, hey, we could be China!. 
t1_dsdopmr	0	*	Maybe you are. I am an ugly bag of mostly water.
t1_dsfifr8	0	*	Who said that?
t1_dse1gim	0	*	So Obama is just as culpable as Clinton, got it.
t1_dsdq14c	1	*	 Many people would call you a Nazi for that yeah. Not me, but Trump has been called a Nazi thousands of times because he tolerates Nazis, you are tolerating him being a Nazi by saying he's not a Nazi.
t1_dsdqnap	0	*	Struggling to pay for basics as a college student.  I don't even have cable.  Unfortunately that isn't an option for a lot of people.
t1_dsdqmia	1	*	When the Democrats last had power we got the ACA.

t1_dsdt6a3	1	*	No, for Trump for example, we have actual media reports and confessions. 
t1_dsdlqws	1	*	It would be surreal for me too if he flashed me his huge wrinkly balls on our first meeting. I mean, like, take me to lunch first, bastard.
t1_dseajd0	0	*	TV news has problems I'm not sure how to tackle.  Long form in depth interviews might be helpful.
t1_dsdkb7f	1	*	That's my point. No candidate is elected before kissing some serious AIPAC ass first.
t1_dsdnfqp	1	*	I don't want to defend him either but it's a very good example of how bad things are in this administration. 
t1_dt243ga	1	*	Oh right I see.

t1_dsllvti	1	*	I confirm this.
t1_dsmemda	1	*	People shouldn't need religion to make them act like decent human beings. I find it usually has the opposite effect. 
t1_dsecn5p	0	*	I'm going to go on a limb I'm no Rhodes Scholar or anything but I think if you live in the US you go on http://www.hm.com/us/ and if you are in the UK you go on http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/

t1_du64kcd	1	*	You are blind. So blind.

t1_dup0jzx	1	*	Correct.  I was actually looking up longtail tuna status and the wiki article mentioned the southern bluefin and I followed the tuna link. 
t1_dungh11	1	*	The redneck hicks are the ones catching the fish though.   Not their fault demand for the specific fish is so high; they just wanna feed their redneck hick families. 
t1_duox7ws	0	*	>but moreso out of superstition at weddings and as a show of affluence.  lol please don't comment on things you know nothing about. Such an ignorant comment.

t1_dunlotm	1	*	Look at all those jobs we created for people with rubber gloves, tubs of soap, and toothbrushes!
t1_dtdocfq	1	*	That sounds like a horse who has been broken. I can't agree with this person's logic at all. 
t1_dtdap4c	1	*	That clearly was not berating. I was even complimenting him. I genuinely am asking him a question. Chillax white knight! 
t1_dtdigub	0	*	A republic where corruption has been legalized. Basically a plutocracy/oligarchy hybrid.
t1_dtddetd	1	*	Ouija board?

t1_dtdbeig	1	*	Not mutually exclusive. The US is a republic and a democracy.
t1_dtdhxm3	1	*	Or America!

t1_dtdn5zh	1	*	Their UN Security Council veto probably has something to do with it.
t1_dtdbg1m	0	*	The United States is a representative democracy. Being a republic means it doesn't have a king.

t1_dtezkbq	0	*	Last time the smart and moral did that in Russia, we got the USSR, which reddit despises .
t1_dtdc8f1	1	*	Ummm no you don't. I live in Canada and I can guarantee you that no one is getting arrested for a peaceful rally or protest. 
t1_dtdglkz	1	*	That's not always true, the Soviets didn't have that problem when Stalin died. It depends in the system really and how it's all organised.

t1_dsa3kkd	1	*	The market wants what it wants, and a first-person perspective from China has scarcity and value. If China was completely open those youtubers would have a lot more competition.

t1_dttxeei	1	*	That's true. I agree with everything you say.   The general principle is stay smart but not be a smart-ass. 
t1_dttr0p8	0	*	Oh for sure, I'm fully pro-legalization (although I don't smoke). And there's not much concern about toxicity, but rather the effect on brain development and function and things like that.

t1_dstqar0	1	*	Thank you. Yes. There are a ton more outlets in which we can hopefully unify a Country. Playing a sport is not one of them 
t1_dstqgxi	0	*	That analogy doesn't really work as nobody went to war with Germany over it's camps. They went to war with Germany because of aggressive military expansionism.

t1_dts4i6h	0	*	Where do you live in Canada? I know British Columbia is lax, but I heard that in other provinces like Ontario, this isn't necessarily the case. 
t1_dud86py	1	*	Okay, so why do you think Genocide watch listed Whites as an at risk group in South Africa?
t1_du9zynm	0	*	That's poes.

t1_du9cmlh	1	*	Need to turn alcohol into water. Like a reverse Jesxfas. Then the drought would be over.
t1_du9hh1y	1	*	I'd be OK with that.
t1_du9yf6c	1	*	No, it's more literal. Imagine someone torturing you while giggling every now and then because they find it fun. 
t1_dualj13	0	*	you can do it my man i believe in you
t1_du9ozqh	0	*	I feel like people are down voting you because they haven't read his username.

t1_du9lg8y	0	*	How is this water fiasco a thing?
t1_du9x0jl	0	*	I actually heard it was a prostitute, but couldn't find anything to verify that. I imagine all are likely scenarios.

t1_du9wijb	1	*	Still gives him quite a bit of leeway in tardiness though.
t1_du9rnyj	0	*	Well of course black people cant be racist! Now lets just ignore how they treat white South African farmers and how theyre begging them to come back.

t1_du9dm77	1	*	Well that's the most terrifying thing I've read all day.
t1_duaj49r	0	*	Read the article and let's discuss
t1_du9ibur	1	*	I loved it.
t1_dua03c0	0	*	What is communism and socialism?? EFF is communism. Not ANC.
t1_du9lcmh	0	*	My guess is that it comes from the dutch, where south is zuid.
t1_dua0xbx	1	*	You have to be specific. It's the northeastern part of the country that boko haram is rampant.
t1_dsextvz	0	*	If you were correct, we'd all be buying free range chickens, organic meat, fairtrade chocolate, and avoid mobiles that were assembled by using slave labour.  It just won't happen.
t1_dtpfsld	1	*	The tides turning on the rich.
t1_dtfxbb6	1	*	No one said economists are perfect. Your links say they were off by .1%. 
t1_dtnj9xz	1	*	I uploaded the Info (Report from the 2. Feb) it is a bit down, as well as in the r/nuclearpower!  Regards
t1_du8buin	0	*	I trust Trump about as far as I can throw him!  At least Trump is in the real estate business not the business of security.  That's not to say he tells the truth (ever)!
t1_du8430t	0	*	Everyone will blame the russians! They don't even have to do any more work we're already doing it for them. 
t1_du9jlrl	1	*	Hmm...  Seems like China would be the most likely culprit then.  Get Russia and the US to fight.  Subjugate the loser and chum up to the winner.
t1_du889i7	0	*	I'm saying we need to be better than name-calling.
t1_du7uhg4	0	*	play both sides and create chaos/hatred.  polarizing politics is very, very toxic for the country as a whole.  
t1_du8mtn3	0	*	Are you talking about someone who didnt even get elected? Bad exampls.
t1_du7zshf	0	*	Except the Dems stonewalled the budget and caused a shutdown all by themselves... So why is a simple majority important when you need more to do anything?

t1_du83ajc	1	*	You call getting more votes rigging. That's just silly. 
t1_du81kii	1	*	They have been actively undermining the FBI investigation, and even trying to get Mueller fired. But go ahead and pretend that's normal. 
t1_du83blb	0	*	Apparently that's your definition of rigging, so...

t1_dsvwdud	1	*	Totally makes sense. Just not a factor I was considering. 
t1_du3apoz	0	*	Issue is that there's no definitive test for are you high right now
t1_dt49gfp	1	*	And I am just as desperate to keep what I have because I have just as much right to my glimmer of hope.
t1_dt3tfi3	1	*	If they dont want to risk death then maybe they should stay in their country. 
t1_dswisp5	0	*	And pretty sure the British deputy foreign minister would have condemned them during their illegitimacy
t1_dsxon62	1	*	Amazing.  Everything you just said was completely wrong.
t1_du2huba	0	*	How is Gitmo a concentration camp? Illegitimate detention doesn't equate to forced labor and extermination. 
t1_dte8iio	0	*	Neat
t1_dtcvvo5	1	*	This is well said and explains how it seems a lot of people feel.
t1_dtdopg6	1	*	Lol, yeah, but not registered to vote.  And voter ID wouldn't prevent them from voting, because they'd have an ID.

t1_dtcy0nh	0	*	The electoral college favors rural populations, thats its purpose
t1_dtd3ecb	1	*	People harvest Reddit accounts and sell them.
t1_dtcgusg	1	*	That source says nothing about Obama trying to circumvent FISA laws.  It DOES say that this administration's allusions to that effect are just false accusations though.
t1_dtdeieg	1	*	This is true, I agree completely.
t1_dtcn7mm	1	*	It's not uncommon for public company IPO's to be millions of shares. Owning 5% of a million stocks would be 50,000 shares.
t1_dtdcxee	1	*	1) They don't have the best and brightest ruling the country - they have the most politically connected  2) There are definitely no checks and balances. Jinping is an absolute dictator.
t1_dtcieqk	0	*	What makes you say that? Do you not know how things go viral?
t1_dtczhp2	0	*	That's not why it's there.
t1_dtdtlvi	0	*	I voted obama.  She called me deplorable because I like pepe and support trump.    Thats an insane lie  
t1_dtcj2s5	0	*	I suppose you can prove that assertion.
t1_dtcsceg	0	*	but what about the right!  I never said the right don't. I'm discussing Russian troll bots. That's the boogie man the left uses not the right.
t1_dtdcejw	1	*	DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA ARMY SPAMMING  WHAT? 
t1_dtt7kla	1	*	Oligarchs were.  Concerned at all?
t1_dsiymys	1	*	Republicans are the party most inclined towards oligarchy. In fact they seem to have a hard on for it.
t1_dsixfui	1	*	Where did I argue that?
t1_dsifx81	0	*	Here's a tip, when someone noticed you're a troll account, abandon it and try again later. Nobody will get fooled by you.
t1_dsjn2j5	1	*	I'm saying a republican is covering for republicans.  
t1_dsizxfl	1	*	Act how? The next step is *actual battle*.
t1_dv3a78m	1	*	Based on actual figures, Poland had below-average anti-Semitism though, and there's a modern push to paint the nation as a whole as complicit in Nazism.
t1_dsv8r9f	1	*	Most actually use lipo batteries which are generally 3.7v per cell. For example the dji phantom 3 uses a 15.2v battery.
t1_dswg236	1	*	Haha
t1_dsvbe1w	0	*	You don't know what you're talking about. Rigid Inflatable Boats and Jet Skis are super common on beaches in Australia with surf and drive near people all the time.

t1_dsw33s9	1	*	Funny part is he could probably build you a new dog given enough time and capital. One you'd never have to pick up the poop. If it had poop, it'd be capable it picking it up itself.
t1_dsvyz07	1	*	Precidents set in place by former presidents. Sad state of affairs and abuse of technology IMO.
t1_dsvmttb	1	*	To be fair, the man doesn't think that we live in reality and is against workers' rights. There is a reasonable disconnect.
t1_dsvbrvg	1	*	I thought cthulhu took care of that ?
t1_dsvf88v	0	*	Did you miss the point of my post?  Technology is not inherently good or bad it's what you do with it.

t1_dsvges3	1	*	Lol that sub has more propaganda than the Donald sub 
t1_dsvegu2	1	*	UP YOU BLUE BOYS
t1_dsvbet4	0	*	Insanity. The lifeguard was in a lose-lose situation, there was nothing he could have done to be correct. How are people this stupid allowed to make these decisions?
t1_dsv9xrl	1	*	What the frick?... the heck?
t1_dswc23w	1	*	No, futurology is full of snake oil technology and overhyped titles.

t1_dsvay7o	1	*	Any sufficiently studied magic is indistinguishable from technology.

t1_dsvl8th	0	*	> I can get about 2.5 miles before I lose the video signal on a good day.  Are you using a directional antenna? Pretty sure you'd be able to pick up more signal if you improve directivity.

t1_dsvauxt	1	*	History buff here - this is accurate 
t1_dsv9y12	1	*	I get the same thing.
t1_dtz8og9	1	*	I move away from the mic to eat chocolate pudding.
t1_dtoolo1	0	*	Right - left in politics is more of a line drawn on sand, in 1930 ties right wingers were killing Jews, modern day in some countries introduce gay marriages. 
t1_dtp5mxf	0	*	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9JRLCBb7qK8     He's not wrong though, as it was turning frogs gay. It was legit, and if it was doing that to frogs imagine what's its doing to humans.
t1_dtolvhv	0	*	There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that will happen.   Have you forgotten that we can still vote after we leave the EU?  Far too many alarmist morons on here. Get a grip.
t1_dtgzsmh	1	*	Suffer enough to make you hate your creator and curse your birth-who is in charge of this dump, anyway?
t1_dtgl2tw	1	*	People go clean from morphine in hospitals 
t1_dtf9phq	0	*	the president, I assume
t1_duegbzc	1	*	I don't disagree but I think the majority doesn't care enough to protest unless it (seemingly) impacts them on a personal level. Mere hypocrisy isn't enough to spur them into action.
t1_ds8ux21	1	*	The thing is, though, that Abkhazia and South Ossetia were de facto independent even before this war.
t1_dstn4ht	0	*	Seems to work though!
t1_ds89e83	1	*	LOL I rest my case
t1_ds85cvi	0	*	You think Trump knows how to spell Revoke?

t1_ds800to	1	*	I'm with you. I am in no way a health nut. But kale actually tastes pretty damn good. 
t1_ds7yrka	1	*	No you don't, you're just better at lying to yourself than the rest of us. 
t1_ds7xiss	1	*	Neither.
t1_ds7yk9g	1	*	And as someone in Europe if you think the biggest military power in the world's opinion doesn't weigh down EVERY war talk ANYWHERE you are naive.

t1_ds87mxa	1	*	Put them in the oven till they get crispy and salt and pepper liberally. Not half bad at that point. 
t1_ds7nyvy	1	*	Honestly, i dont think thats Trumps plan. It might be SK taking advantage of the situation, by i dont believe its pre meditated 
t1_ds873fp	0	*	I hope you realise pretty much no one in nk uses electricity. They will starve the entire country to death before giving into the West's demands.
t1_ds8gpq2	1	*	Or dont eat it?
t1_ds8ucfs	0	*	Nk invaded SK. We countered that invasion and stationed troops so they didn't do it again. 
t1_ds7zdbh	1	*	Try spinach
t1_ds81db1	1	*	Please read the article it clearly states that they have a meeting after 2 years.
t1_ds7o7aw	0	*	In their original press releases NK never threaten. If you cant read korean and your media exxagerates and lies thats your problem.
t1_ds7uw3k	0	*	Neither did North Korea for awhile, apparently they just got the ability to target USA cities.

t1_ds8ecvi	1	*	I thought it was 10, in a deal partially brokered by Obama (as a senator) himself.  Just how betrayed do you think Yanukovych felt when the US whistled and walked away?
t1_ds7st1q	1	*	It could be, but that aint something to boast about. Therefore, twat
t1_ds83373	1	*	The only way I've had kale is in soups. And there it can stay. 
t1_ds7owk0	0	*	That's definitely the spin that Trump is going for, but it doesn't fit the timeline.
t1_ds8uxxq	1	*	The thing is, though, that Abkhazia and South Ossetia were de facto independent even before this war.
t1_ds7y3xq	1	*	When you get rid of its crappy texture?
t1_ds7s86b	1	*	Not to mention that aide is going to help prolong the regime. Which if people want to end they need to not fall for the same shit.
t1_ds89xpt	0	*	So if our enemy had 30,000 fully mobilized troops right on the other side of the Mexican border and aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Mexico you wouldnt consider that a threat?

t1_ds8ivgh	1	*	I'm not American.
t1_ds81xug	0	*	North Korea has the largest army on earth therefore they are the most powerful country in earth. If you say it three times it doesnt make it true.
t1_ds83lyl	1	*	I think two of those words are made up.
t1_ds892i4	1	*	I mean... most wars end up pretty terrible for the people. If NK and US go to war no one will be happy except maybe the two dolts masterminding the whole thing. 
t1_ds7x70o	1	*	I love kale. Saute the stems in a little oyster sauce and garlic add some water and it is delicious.   
t1_ds82wos	1	*	Both are applicable. In Arizona we say Mexico. In Florida we say Cuba.

t1_ds7xqu3	0	*	It's cabbage.
t1_ds7wdif	1	*	It's just Ukraine. The word 'The' doesn't exist in Ukrainian, so it's impossible that's its 'The Ukraine' 
t1_dsg5yce	1	*	Theyre*  Probably shouldnt call someone a dumbass and make that mistake in the same sentence. Normally I wouldnt care about a grammatical issue, but given the context I think its important. 
t1_dsg38o6	0	*	source? 
t1_dsg8wfd	0	*	The book was public domain too and could be purchased by anyone, why did Wikileaks feel the need to promote a pdf of it? Especially since it wasnt a government document. 
t1_dsfp7ij	1	*	Sounds like most Trump supporters.
t1_dsgawl1	1	*	If it were any other time in American history I'd 100% agree with this.  Considering Roy Moore's narrow loss and Trump's own sketchy history with the underaged though...not so much.
t1_dsg10ox	1	*	wat
t1_dsg3n4c	1	*	It's not that person's age you should be worried about...
t1_dsfvmzu	0	*	Obama created the FBI to spy on Trump
t1_dsga1o6	1	*	Chuck AssGrassley
t1_dsg3dmv	0	*	Everyone else does it too is not a valid defense. 
t1_dsg8k5r	0	*	the sad truth is that they don't care as much as you do. 
t1_dsg0kqc	0	*	Sounds like a Slavic washing machine brand.
t1_dsg3qzh	1	*	To excuse it? They'll just bitch about Hillary and ignore it.
t1_dsgcli6	1	*	And it sort of looks like they recommended criminal charges so they could prevent the release of this transcript since it's suddenly related to a criminal investigation
t1_dsgchct	0	*	Isnt Tillersons tactics exactly how H.H, Holmes built his death house? Basically just by confusing everyone and hiring and firing contractors?
t1_dsfzuht	0	*	Probably just not finished yet?
t1_dsfzv6w	0	*	My guess is legal cases that hold the potential to take down a President need slightly more fact checking and evidence than various internet sources. Be patient, he will be around.
t1_dsg335r	1	*	 In b4 rip 
t1_dsfysvi	1	*	Good breakdown, helps dispel the myth that their written articles aren't much less weaselly than their opinion programs.

t1_dsgctdm	1	*	> Trump is like very ahead of the game.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
t1_dsgbcl2	0	*	You call that an aggressive defense of Trump?
t1_dsg0cfb	1	*	You can't put someone in prison for incompetence+motive to be deliberately incompetent. Congress is supposed to notice the latter and prevent confirmation in the first place. Alas...
t1_dsfyqiv	0	*	You are incorrect. The 5th protects you from self incrimination or witnessing against yourself nothing more. you can be compelled to speak. Its called contempt and you can be jailed for it.
t1_dshbbfq	1	*	That is totally preposterous. If redditors started dropping dead then its time for revolution. Luckily try as trump may, we still live in a free society.
t1_dsg1qe8	0	*	Or my favorite mix-up between then and than:  I'd rather be pissed off then pissed on!
t1_dsjd785	0	*	No it doesn't, only if your testimony harms yourself.   No person... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...    
t1_dsg7e6p	1	*	It will 100% be Bill Clinton did something similar, this has nothing to do with his ability to lead  Probably some bullshit peppered in about how Bill was worse because Lewinsky was a subordinate.
t1_dsg5gd0	1	*	Several things from the dossier were confirmed prior to this story. 
t1_dsg2lgr	0	*	I actually loled after reading this. The last administration saw to that already with his red lines...what a joke.
t1_dsg69h4	1	*	Ah yes...Reddit's official shortbus.
t1_dsg4imm	1	*	Yay fascism!
t1_dsh89mo	1	*	There will be no consequences because the vast majority of American citizens are fools who will always vote for safety and cheap televisions over all else.
t1_dsg6mtu	0	*	Nationalism.  There's a huge difference.
t1_dsgab7f	1	*	I don't see an criminal allegation against Fusion GPS in that article, did I miss it?

t1_dsg89yz	1	*	Im giving you and upvote for effort
t1_dsfp92y	0	*	I'm not sure what you're saying.  Someone released it and if FusionGPS only gave it to the gov, where did it come from?
t1_dsg62mk	1	*	Like what Argentina (Kirshner?) pulled on Alberto Nisman
t1_dsg7v2l	1	*	Not as long as the Republicans are in charge. That's a bonus for them. 
t1_dsga7hm	1	*	shell probably end up being censured in a vote 
t1_dsg2gxt	1	*	Youre the only comment in this entire thread that gets an upvote. Thank you.
t1_dsfqs8r	1	*	Actually, it was Jeb Bushs camp who initially funded them.
t1_dsg45p0	1	*	Wouldn't it be funny if Trump was his own unwitting source? He seems to have very little legal knowledge, all it would probably take is an agent befriending him. 
t1_dsg1fcp	0	*	Hiring a private investigator to fabricate plausible lies makes perfect sense. That's why 1. Steele's credibility and reputation; and 2. the independent confirmation; are so important.
t1_dsg092r	1	*	Um, studying has about 3 months left in the US - we're going into the neo-feudal dark ages now...
t1_dsg5x5r	1	*	I think you just don't know it exists.
t1_dsg685z	1	*	Don't expect a rebuttal to the truth, just downvotes and demands that you leave because your opinions offend them.
t1_dsg4hfn	1	*	RIP Rob buddy.
t1_ds1wmh8	1	*	An ordnance technician at a dead run outranks everybody.

t1_dshs9bt	0	*	Yes it does make sense, contrary to the reddit narrative, Israel does not support Genocide
t1_duidzd2	1	*	I don't understand how this is a reply to me. 
t1_duigdch	1	*	Some people can take some shit for fun, others can't, and a few dish it out inappropriately. I often fit in that last group.
t1_duigbi7	1	*	That's a hilarious reply dude.
t1_dv35293	1	*	That may divert some attention away, but wont change anything in Russia. So, in the end Russia doesn't win anything with it. But meanwhile Putin's cronies...
t1_dt0jwsu	0	*	Source? And was it official or just some hogwash?
t1_dt1qgvv	1	*	5000 of which were children women and elderly rebels? Believe the narrative of the government on a massacre, not the best idea
t1_dt1s3pz	0	*	If your friends are the members of FETxd6,  then they deserve it. 
t1_dt0y74g	1	*	The massacre was mainly carried out by Kurdish tribes.
t1_dt10m8u	1	*	A terrorist source? No thanks. 
t1_dt3jd57	0	*	You are completely missing the point.   You dont hit a city center cause of whoops daisies. It was intentionally to kill civilians. 
t1_dv3s8oe	0	*	Who gives a fuck, when a blockchain is more consistent than the banking system 
t1_dudg9ha	1	*	What exactly? Please explain...
t1_dub7faw	1	*	The only one of those that is relevant to the Russia sanction is the Kurdish one.  But even that is a stretch.  So, sure, go further.    
t1_ds4ukb1	0	*	Ugh, these Gurus are the worst. Imagine a telavengalist except a thousand times more popular, evil and scam-ey.   And yes, before people jump on me, not all of them are bad. 
t1_ds4z0yc	1	*	Muzzafarnagar was 62 deaths, Gujarat was 1000+, entire state machinery compromised, minister of state found handing out weapons to rioters and convicted. Depends on what you consider 'big'.
t1_du26nev	1	*	BNW is the ultimate fascist welfare state though.
t1_du2id95	1	*	Koreans would vote for Kim Il Sung???  Where did u get that BS?  Kim Il Sung started out as a puppet of the USSR.  Most Koreans didnt even know who he was.
t1_du2ojfp	0	*	Why is this downvoted? Huxley and Orwell argued what would really happen, turn out they were both right. People are watching reruns of real housewives right now on Xanax.
t1_dslgo3z	0	*	Don't get lost in the details. What I'm really trying to say is that modern society has become a little too delicate on most matters. We all need to be a little more thick skinned. 
t1_duvzim7	1	*	> Yes, we can.   -- The United States
t1_duw99ho	1	*	damn boy, you sure got him huh? /s
t1_dsshn0y	1	*	wrong, good things are despite america. weather included.
t1_dt3fw5x	1	*	What good has trump done. Seriously. All I hear is he's made good deals. Been good for the economy. How?
t1_dsrxljm	0	*	People, not land, should determine elections, yeah.   So California should, proportionally, have a larger role than Iowa. 
t1_dst4fi2	1	*	Well he is an idiot. Nobody is denying that part.
t1_dsgmhzc	1	*	>I dont think I wanna be in a tank that got hit by one, or be in a tank that got its low yield ammunition destroyed.  I don't think I'd want to be in the tank that fires it either.
t1_dsghn6a	1	*	The article is all bullshit.  From experience.  ISC (Ret.)
t1_duefxzl	1	*	As an American who has lived in states on both coasts, in the midwest, and now in Texas... I've literally never seen the item you're complaining about.
t1_due85ht	0	*	http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/20-reasons-you-should-vote-to-leave-the-european-union/  And it only took me 15 seconds. inhale a dick
t1_due88lu	1	*	But stuff like does happen all the time. Otherwise no company or citizen would pay out the ass for a lobbyist. 
t1_duenpmk	1	*	I think the British people are tired of hearing from experts - Gove (paraphrasing)
t1_due5zt2	1	*	That definitely played a role in some minds Im sure but I suspect the main reasons were more day to day problems being blamed on the EU. 
t1_dtqndy7	1	*	Thank you! My opinion exactly!
t1_dtqr7pf	0	*	You used to be a cc denier? What brought you around?
t1_dtqjh07	1	*	Metaphorical sweets is literal beef.
t1_dtqbuvu	1	*	Thanks Mr Koch.
t1_dtqx030	1	*	Because none are dependent on another.
t1_dttkykv	1	*	Lol you cant teach cats much of anything 
t1_dtq9lt5	1	*	Are you denying climate change is largely man-made?  Not saying you are, just looking for clarification.
t1_dtqr84j	1	*	Unrelated, but the animalia with the most mass collectively on the planet is the beetles.
t1_dtqpd54	1	*	I get what you're saying but I don't think it works that way.
t1_dtrj261	0	*	record lows are more likely as well. Climate change gives us more extreme weather. It's not just the warming part.
t1_dtqz3mk	1	*	Then it really doesn't matter, does it?  (semi-sarcastically)
t1_dtqlu4w	0	*	Its not difficult at all to imagine.   I see the numbers too about the ice levels.  I get that.  I get that it also gains too.    8 polar bears in a story don't reflect the population.    
t1_dtqg895	1	*	Venus fly traps tickle just right.
t1_dtqmx1l	0	*	We have already figured out birth control, population rates are declining in most developed countries.   The issue is the rest of the world doesn't like them.
t1_dtqomh2	0	*	Skrrrrrr- *pop pop*
t1_dtq8yxm	0	*	It's ironic that only with a first world way of life can anybody care about this
t1_dtqo9vi	0	*	The latter yeah, can't blame the photographer for recording what they see.
t1_dtqhxst	0	*	Exactly. So we are just going to ride it until the wheels fall off
t1_dtrpvdq	1	*	so sloth, greed, and ignorance, thats a lot better /s
t1_dtt93qr	0	*	Universities are all liberal leaning. Using them as a basis is about as good as using fox news
t1_dtr55cl	1	*	I will! Thanks. 
t1_dtqfzt8	1	*	Ah, a subtle (but important) nuance I didnt catch. Thanks for explaining!
t1_dtrr79r	1	*	Triggered is right, and I think I'm wasteful sometimes but then I see this posted and I feel a bit better that I don't do obviously dumb shit. 
t1_dtqance	0	*	It would be the collapse of an ecosystem humans don't live in.
t1_dtsqdjc	1	*	China and India need it more.
t1_dtqb3lh	0	*	The article reads to me like it's taking about surface area.
t1_dtypjk5	1	*	i mean, its actually an argument that many non-vegans use, so cant really blame me :)
t1_du03syg	1	*	> In europe i mostly eat shellfish and salads.  WTF?! Calm down there, Hitler!
t1_dtzbxc0	1	*	you a word
t1_dtzo7s8	1	*	grammar
t1_dvawveb	0	*	so your enemy suppose to be all meat eater in the world, instead of only dog eaters? Otherwise is that unfair to pigs, rabbits, cows, hens  and many more?
t1_dtz8dg7	0	*	Supposedly, its an un-housebreakable-dog breed, closer to a wolf than a domesticatable dog dog.    I'm really not sure how true that is, though.
t1_dtys7yf	0	*	also with dogs in some parts of the world. The point is, don't take offense to what others do. They're not telling you try their dogburgers.
t1_du0qhnz	0	*	I would say most people aren't discussing it, because it isn't a big deal. It hasn't hit any big media as far as I know.
t1_dtz141j	0	*	Korean hygiene is generally a bit iffy. You take your chances with a lot of things here.
t1_dtz5t85	0	*	for some dog > human > cat > rest :(

t1_du7uyyu	1	*	Yeah its nuts.
t1_ds64p3e	0	*	Oi mate
t1_ds5uux9	0	*	I'm sure a fire can still start though, looks like it crashed into a field of wheat. There are haybales nearby.   
t1_dslj32k	1	*	No you took them in because of your self destructive leftist politicians. They passed the buck onto america. Don't be such a fool as to let them do that.
t1_dslsx0m	0	*	So are the majority of American gun owners. We just have a shit ton of criminal elements in our inner cities that like to murder each other.
t1_dsljiqv	0	*	Also, many Americans get little vacation time.
t1_dsn518x	0	*	> we're pretty much the only country with protected free speech  Nonsense. 
t1_dsnw3ld	0	*	I never assumed or implied that.
t1_dsl5lza	1	*	The proportion of the population that's Muslim aren't that different in those two countries. You obviously don't know anything about them.
t1_dsldze1	0	*	I don't think you truly have a grasp of just how much a shithole your country actually is. Come back when your major cities don't have homicide figures that could pass off as minor insurgencies.
t1_dsmp6u0	0	*	But I like Hoek's Death Metal Pizza shop :( 
t1_dslcnk7	1	*	I was not specifically talking about Norway, but Europe in general. And in Norway, theres also Bergen and Stavanger.
t1_dsl33c4	1	*	No, but some people might misinterpret it that way. 
t1_dsldz9h	1	*	I don't know about moving to the US, but getting residency in Norway is actually pretty darn difficult depending on the field you work in. 
t1_dsm2s3b	1	*	I love you.
t1_dsmaqyo	0	*	For postgraduates probably, but if you work and live in the US for a prolonged amount of time, that surely is registered?
t1_dsl67t9	1	*	Thats literally selfish lol
t1_dsl8jc6	0	*	You think he knows that?
t1_dsls9ez	0	*	when u move to a country or city, are u like hmm that place's population is small i won't move there or are u like wow this place has amazing jobs, lemme move there?
t1_dsl3zx2	1	*	England's view of the Polish would like a word with you
t1_dskzc3r	1	*	Sounds like it might be a mostly U.S. problem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathenry_(new_religious_movement)#Racial_issues
t1_dsl8s48	1	*	seeing that he clearly can't hold a single focused thought for long, sadly this is more likely than the Norway is White' explanation.
t1_dskzddh	0	*	Care to elaborate?
t1_dslhdqa	0	*	When did he say that? Was that in the same meeting?
t1_dslpxoc	0	*	That statement is completely at odds with the previous statement that biathlons are popular.
t1_dskyy8b	1	*	Yea they could but there places that are even better for some of them. Most of it is just choice though.
t1_dsl5095	0	*	Why mention the horseshoe theory? I'm talking about a spectrum.  And please, I'm a European. I'm perfectly aware of how they differ from each other. 
t1_dsmcucx	1	*	As a political scientist, I know exactly what I am talking about. In the meantime, you are a liar and have provided zero arguments.  Also: Do you claim to be a real political scientist or an American?
t1_dsl6sa7	1	*	So does most of the world it seems. 
t1_dsl43lb	0	*	I would blame it on people like Trump, who have brought it to the mainstream. I'm so sorry, but it's not exactly outlandish to suggest that with the history the guy has.
t1_dsldwjw	1	*	You have to wait for it to cycle through France and Germany before returning back to Norway.
t1_dslv9k6	0	*	You are 100% spot-on. Thanks lol.  It made a very big difference too
t1_dslahpv	1	*	So, a mortgage?
t1_dsl2nj9	0	*	Liberals are not socialists. Conservatives have been off in the corner ranting about socialism as if it's 1959.    Lol
t1_dsl0xp0	1	*	What? People in the US pay way more than in other countries for private healthcare.
t1_dskztah	1	*	Why would it not provide an incentive? You still have providers competing for price. 
t1_dsltqqt	0	*	Spare a thought for the descendants of the Irish who migrated to Australia.
t1_dslw3v9	1	*	Didn't make anyone rich. Edit: tried googling john with hookers to make a congress meme. Was pleasantly surprised, and now listening to John Lee Hooker lol
t1_dsm2g6g	1	*	The Monster Math...
t1_dsl8z80	1	*	Do you know how many applied by country?  
t1_dsm926a	1	*	Nah, Gulf Stream and proximity to the see means (for the latituate they are st) relatively mild winters and mild summers. The climate in Canada is more similar to Russia.

t1_dsl950v	0	*	The same applies to the US.  What is your point exactly?  In fact the personal debt bubble in the US is worse.
t1_dsl6oo2	0	*	You're wrong.  About everything you've said in this thread.  And yet you keep saying things.  Why?  What motivates you?
t1_du7e9hw	0	*	Punny joke. He was a (moderate) *right* wing party (VVD) secretary (minister in dutch) who now has *left* the office..
t1_du8h8zj	1	*	Thanks :-) Ill have to look up anoxic event. I hadnt heard of it until now. 
t1_duurdkx	0	*	Netflix has a category for that: Movies with strong female leads. 
t1_duutli6	1	*	> I'm an addict alcohol, who is sober.  sure about that one?  just kidding, hope you're feelin' better. keep it up. 
t1_duvadkq	1	*	While we're at,  lets lighten the load on teachers and have all the armed and addicted children form some sort of militia. 
t1_duvtqtv	1	*	Because he refused to fill a script?
t1_duuxidk	0	*	Hoping that it cures their addiction also.. like pushes them to wtfu. 
t1_duvan79	0	*	I know. But it's apparently impolite to call a spade a spade according to this site.
t1_duv35ba	1	*	So recreational doesn't actually mean recreational at all in this context, instead it means something entirely different? That's just poor language.
t1_duuyq0z	1	*	I mean, in fairness that's not a hard skill.  Literally anyone could post a meme that my mom felt good about and convince her it was a fact. 
t1_duv2u9q	1	*	Are we sure that isn't Gary Buseys love child?
t1_dux69s1	1	*	Useless and impossible to ignore, kinda like hemorrhoids.

t1_duv623n	1	*	Aren't we already making great headway with this?
t1_duuxv1y	1	*	Seems to be some serious self hatred going on.

t1_duvafbh	1	*	We're coming to get you drug person
t1_duv47eh	1	*	this comment plus your username make you my favourite cyber-human of the day so far :)
t1_duv2j4i	1	*	> that his nurse was actually working for the FBI  Rule 34!  Rule 34!
t1_duvc4c7	1	*	Yes, but generally not fentanyl unless you already have a tolerance to opioids.
t1_duv1410	1	*	Not directly. Some of them fall off the edge of society after being fired.
t1_duv0bh7	1	*	We should call it gerrydeadering
t1_duvlwof	1	*	Obviously I think inequality is a problem. Reading comprehension is an important skill, you know.
t1_duvdk8v	0	*	You mean two outlets reporting on the same anonymous unconfirmed sources?
t1_duuwvp2	0	*	Which wouldn't stop people from dealing it
t1_duuwpab	0	*	Michigan got a pretty huge bailout in the form of the Auto Industry bailout.
t1_duuudwn	1	*	There are a lot of psychologists and doctors who have said they believe he is going senile.
t1_duv35lp	0	*	That sounds like potentially bad news for terminal cancer patients and their caretakers.
t1_duuxqo9	1	*	USA! USA!
t1_duv4vxg	1	*	Rush Limbaugh was calling for the execution of drug addicts?
t1_duwbccz	1	*	Opiates for a broken bone.
t1_duwtb8w	1	*	Prozac and ADD medications are the APA. AMA might have had something to do with promoting opioids, though, I don't know.
t1_duuwi8r	0	*	I understand, I am curious about your thoughts on the death penalty for dealing drugs with such a high kill rate, like heroin.
t1_duv4uno	1	*	Yea, he actually thought he made that shit up.
t1_duv2sh9	1	*	Indeed. Politics is the art of doublespeak. Except for Duterte and Trump. They are so fucking batshit crazy that Orwell is lost on them.
t1_duv4ju6	1	*	Christ man
t1_duv4xht	1	*	Except that alcohol is a drug.

t1_dsd1e0e	0	*	... its not a joke
t1_dugvx3t	1	*	Have you even heard of tobacco?
t1_ds3yl3g	1	*	You are right, depressingly so.
t1_ds1c8f8	1	*	>Lots  There were just two in the article, both of which were likely just admin oversights that could be easily rectified.
t1_ds1crls	0	*	Nothing I said disagrees with that. But that's not company store/enslavement by debt sort of territory. It's underpayment of agreed wages.
t1_ds5uuk5	0	*	To be fair, either that range or charging options as common as gas stations.
t1_ds5x9yf	1	*	Dix he say which decade?

t1_ds666zq	1	*	No, those are customers. Apple cult people use the product. The Musk cult is easily 100x the total cars Tesla will ever make before bankruptcy
t1_ds65wkq	1	*	There's a browser extension that'll let you queue emails to be sent at different times in gmail so you never need to look like you don't live a completely standard up at 7 bed at 11 life. 
t1_ds60aao	1	*	 Not if the guy continues to push the technological boundary, and make the public dream like hes been doing for the last however many years now.  Imagination is a powerful thing.
t1_ds66iit	0	*	Old shitty companies, sure, work in a startup that does engineering and chances are every founder will have a strong engineering background.
t1_ds5upmw	1	*	Exactly. Tesla is more than a car company. It is a brand. A brand that has insanely positive press and likeability.   
t1_ds66vp8	1	*	Also fun is if it's your job to get them to renew after the new business sales guy sold them something impossible, then handed it off to you, the account manager. 
t1_ds5ufj3	0	*	The Bolt is an econ car for $37,000. Model 3 is a $35,000 car that happens to be electric.

t1_ds605e0	0	*	i8 is not good looking?
t1_ds5z0mf	1	*	fuck that shit.  I will never drive anything that is not a German. Have you ever been on a model S? Fugly. My opinion, sure, but it is shared among many german car lovers.  
t1_ds6anyc	1	*	That's funny, I have the Gen 1, and I'd call the interior polarizing, even though I can live with it. I think they made the Gen 2 interior much more neutral.
t1_ds66269	1	*	You know what they say... Everyone loves cocaine, most people just don't know it yet.
t1_ds65odd	1	*	You cocaine filled monster.
t1_ds5yrb4	0	*	Not saying you are wrong, but how do you know they are losing money?
t1_ds64t0x	1	*	Does your uncle work for nintendo?
t1_ds5vcnd	1	*	True, but if the model 3 hits mass production Americans will empty teslas factories. The average American isn't comfortable driving something that looks like it came out of my kids toy box.
t1_ds66nvf	0	*	I understand now, thanks!
t1_ds66cpe	1	*	Volume, quality, sustainability and profitability...   He's a great salesman who happens to be a billionaire entrepreneur.   
t1_ds5tytq	1	*	And it's not surprising that probably more than 50% startups fail and it's because of those very reasons he listed. Sooner or later he's going to have to actually deliver. 
t1_ds5oyd5	0	*	No one who isn't lying would claim they can ramp up production by that much that quickly.
t1_ds65s4k	1	*	That sounds awfully close to saying a country cannot remain in public debt forever. Whereas, obviously, it can and they do.  It's not the best analogy but the point is that both can be managed.
t1_ds64z98	1	*	Bmw doesnt have a comparable car now or available in the near future.  Also, late model bmws have had issues with catastrophic engine failures and are generally not known for reliability.  
t1_ds65xux	1	*	Yeah we notice. And then discuss with our fellow peons if you sleep and/or have a life.   -- Peon. 
t1_ds5x9q6	1	*	Pfft, if you were a good employee you would support your industry and drive a nuclear vehicle.
t1_ds5qtv7	0	*	I don't think you understand how loyal the big 3 customers can be. A lot of those people will drive another brand. 
t1_ds69tdz	1	*	Can't read a paywalled article. Got a relevant clip from the article you want to post?
t1_ds69fqi	1	*	Spontaneous breakdowns are a feature, not a production fault.
t1_ds66g09	1	*	How about that guy Tesla?
t1_ds64ay1	1	*	But the details are why it can't be done :-(
t1_ds5xg1n	1	*	TSLA has always been a big short target. Short squeezes are partly responsible for their rediculous valuation. This is not new territory for them.
t1_ds6llag	0	*	Audi is a separate stock I believe. Think their market cap is 30 B something.
t1_ds6gk0p	1	*	I agree, I have seen people lose their minds with it. 
t1_dt87ikd	0	*	Then the US will just claim SK has WMDs and invade. You seem unaware of how the American war machine operates.
t1_dt8kdrz	1	*	I know that. My point was, it causes political pressure. In a reunification scenario, it's more about dearming rather than actively setting up a program.
t1_dt8gcty	1	*	well the status of forces agreement lasts until the mutual defense treaty expires, which requires 1 year notice before withdraw.
t1_dt8jy4s	1	*	> If it comes to a peaceful unification it would come with amnesty 100%.  Even if this is true, and I don't really know anything, do you think he would believe it?
t1_dt8senu	1	*	US will make unified Korea and unreasonable country.
t1_dt8posr	1	*	That was clearly Kim Jong Il.     *You have been banned from /r/pingpong*      Or whatever  
t1_dt87nku	0	*	They don't have a choice with the UK and France.
t1_dt8m23w	1	*	I think the military bases are leased and on contract. They would have to ask us to leave once the lease is up. However, I'm completely uninformed on this subject.
t1_dt9bfkb	1	*	What if the land is leased like in Qatar?
t1_dt8ddne	1	*	Its not even optimism, just delusion and idiocy

t1_duapc86	0	*	A quarter pound?
t1_duavuro	0	*	Yeah but if theyre caught covering the name, the opposition has a field day. If they simply remove the snow, they can just say they were doing their jobs and deny any political motivation

t1_duao2np	1	*	Wait that's the US
t1_duajeqi	1	*	Frankly I've seen some photos of Butovo and it doesn't even seem that bad. Yes, it's just one high rise after the other, but you still get some green areas, shops, metro connections, etc.

t1_duajmyu	1	*	Nah, this is a reference to its always sunny in Moscow. 
t1_dubkh5y	1	*	Nah, we have plenty of room outside the stretch from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. And the areas with room could really use more liberal voters.

t1_du65nku	1	*	damn son
t1_du5vagy	0	*	Historically speaking, the Catholic Church has issued it's own orders in Ireland, which were followed. So don't be getting all righteous about fatwahs. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...

t1_dtflh5d	1	*	> Turnbull and Trump  Jesus, Trump is handed a silver platter and he can't even recognize it. But instead he takes his shitty deal and pisses off an important ally.   Great work! lol
t1_dtfecox	1	*	WOW! You have no idea what that would involve, and how it would drive America further and quicker down the shitter. 
t1_dtgjhx0	1	*	>There's a reason so much of his stupid misunderstandings and ignorance just happen to resonate so well with his base.  because his base is just as stupid and ignorant?
t1_dthr6ft	0	*	I hope it's well labeled when it's sold here! 
t1_dtf8zj2	1	*	Well it was a cheat software to get around the testing methods of the time. Do you think the techs carrying out the tests can go through all of the cars systems to know U0001f602U0001f602 
t1_dtfc767	1	*	no place any Norwegian would visit, that's for sure!
t1_dtglv9y	1	*	Yes, EU and US specs are different. Examples are the lighting: EU: Rear fog light required US: Side markers required
t1_dsdljyw	0	*	See right there, I see you wrote something but all I read is toxic Internet troll. I know they're words. Did you have a stroke?

t1_dtsrsl0	1	*	!isbot /u/memsbiolabs
t1_dttbawk	1	*	No, they havent, you are spreading misinformation.
t1_dtsnsjd	1	*	Well there are links to both so he's absolutely wrong.  They are both in the news.  This link is not about the other story, which does make it a whataboutism.
t1_dtta7x8	1	*	This is a lie, free speech is not dead in most of Europe.  Weird liar.
t1_dtsqlaj	1	*	England is the same. They sentence people to jail over online posts and have cameras on every corner. The big brother state is insane, but the reddit circlejerk is anti russia so this is news now.
t1_dtspmqc	0	*	There's also the people that think Freedom of Speech protects them from non-government entities.
t1_dtstaj8	1	*	See: whataboutism. Probably the single biggest export from Russia.
t1_dtstr42	1	*	US citizens have been arrested for social media posts too, to a less extent 
t1_dttaijp	0	*	There are many many countries around the world that have freedom of information laws, many of them literally called Freedom of Information Act. Not just the USA.
t1_dtspanv	1	*	At least in Germany the government is legitimately elected. That's a gigantic difference.
t1_dttb7u9	0	*	Really, I seem to recall a certain political subreddit and a narrative surrounding the US elections but that could be just me.
t1_dtspywb	1	*	Whataboutism. Germany sentencing people for offensive speech isn't right either. The only speech that shouldn't be protected is speech meant to incite violence or panic.
t1_dtsmmde	0	*	Yeah, bad vocabulary there.  Administrative, legislative, legal, w the legislative split into two, only one of which controls the money.
t1_dtt0pmx	0	*	American president = Russia so lol

t1_dshmp7v	1	*	Nah, I don't want to support his brand, even ironically. I'll be hitting a bottle of actual liberal tears.
t1_dshzytv	0	*	Dont sweat the geography too much. There is no reason why Canada cannot join the EU and be an EU country following EU laws and such.
t1_dsilkfd	1	*	Oh yeah, they just don't know it yet.
t1_dsi8er4	0	*	Isn't fully ratified but is still operating. Wish everyone failed like that.
t1_dsi2ib7	1	*	ummm to overrule him on nafta might not be that hard actually, its hard to get people from border states and those that rely a lot on Canadian business to not want to keep nafta. 
t1_dshkzht	0	*	If you think Canada stopping the supply of Oil to the US would be reason for invading Canada you are either ignorant or extremely dumb.

t1_dtn3ujz	0	*	It' not technically accurate, its an objective fact. 
t1_dtn0mrb	0	*	The four page memo is your source for verifying the authenticity of the four page memo. Let that sink in for a moment. 
t1_dtn3re4	1	*	If the memo put Trump in a bad light, Nunes and his staff wouldn't have written it, Nunes wouldn't have edited it after the rest of the committee approved it, and Trump wouldn't have released it. 
t1_dtn4tmc	0	*	Here is a good article:  https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2017/01/13/the-trump-dossier-is-false-news-and-heres-why/&refURL
t1_dtn3p3p	1	*	So they are correct. Your belief on wether its stupid or not has no bearing on wether they are correct or not.
t1_dtn1qbm	1	*	The memo implies that the warrant was approved based on biased information. It does not claim that the warrant was approved based on false information.
t1_dtn1swv	1	*	My bad, but still he was one of the signers of the warrent and was picked by Trump to replace Yates. 
t1_dtn5put	0	*	You guys should buy some older accounts next time
t1_dtmxp2x	1	*	raw HUMINT, that's what it looks like. I'd call this memo fanfiction.
t1_dtn0eoz	1	*	Except in this case, nobody was actually caught cheating, the PI just told the wife that he was cheating on her with unverified evidence. 
t1_dtmza0z	0	*	What false pretenses?
t1_dtn166g	0	*	Shitposter complaining about downvotes?   Play shit games, win shit prizes. 
t1_dulspp7	1	*	I reported that comment. He posted percentages. They were incorrect. The correct data is readily available in 2mins. 
t1_dulzlo0	1	*	this sounds like standard military recruitment.  
t1_dulkqra	0	*	Did you even read the article?  > He said he wanted to build a caliphate according to Prophet Muhammad's prophecies.
t1_dt8wp2s	0	*	Everybody is welcome over here so no worries buddy. If you're still worried just make sure you are clothed in full orange colors to blend in!
t1_dt9ll9b	0	*	HACK THE PLANET!
t1_dt95qyq	0	*	> so the Dutch want to brainwash us too?  Suffice to say, the swamp that Trump has been talking about in US exists in Europe, too. And those swamps are working together.
t1_dt9j29z	1	*	It needed to come from a pure source. Wikileaks is up Russia's ass and reddit is full of trolls and bots. And news stories weren't getting enough traction.
t1_dt93eh2	1	*	Nice T_D satire there.
t1_dt9r97p	0	*	Why do you Americans know so little about Europe?
t1_dt8wk38	1	*	I still think it's correct? What am I missing? :D Definitely a funky sentence though!

t1_dtjfb3o	0	*	Harmonic congruence is a tautology 
t1_dtjfzvj	0	*	But the harmonic congruence is just every 10,000 years when Vaatu and Raava fight for the fate of the world!      ...I kinda feel like I missed a point somewhere
t1_ducdl5k	0	*	I completely agree, but that group has benefited from the program the most. I think it's a little backward to be honest. The intent may be there, but it isn't implemented as it should be. 
t1_dtkva0b	1	*	That'll learn 'em!

t1_dt7ibcw	1	*	Most of them are economic migrants, and very few are from actual war zones. Political Asylum should be taken more seriously than a grown man from Afghanistan claiming he's a 14 year old boy

t1_dsrjeth	1	*	It might shock you that some people prefer their own culture and poverty rather than a culture which they do not agree with or are happy and rich. Crazy idea, i know.
t1_dsrkx7n	1	*	Oh ok I must have missed it when my boss was a Turkish lady, went to Turkish stores ran by Turkish women and lived in a place with lots of Turkish people.
t1_dscbddm	1	*	Also don't watch it. Don't just blame the uploader.
t1_dscl4bg	0	*	You're barking up the wrong tree. The only reason the Saudi people would massively protest the government, it is because the government is not Hardline enough for them.
t1_dsbcqub	1	*	Some people aren't worth the effort. Relax and move on.. they'll see the light sometime
t1_dsaohx4	0	*	Al Gore gets this a lot. It's as if the fact that he doesn't wear sackcloth & ashes and walk everywhere means he's a hypocrite who can be safely ignored.
t1_dsaql96	1	*	How can you make a profit off selling oxygen for people to breathe if there isn't a shortage? :P
t1_dsap8pc	1	*	LNG, at least its way cleaner burning than diesel. Some shipping vessels are already being converted. Obviously not entire fleets, but its a start. 
t1_dsake8i	1	*	You hit the nail on the head. We need broad, sweeping, societal change. We need a revolution.
t1_dsakdyz	1	*	The time has come.

t1_dsat3i3	1	*	Thats all just cgi created by whiny entitled millennials that just want handouts and free stuff.  /s 
t1_dscjlmg	1	*	Speaking of internet, Trump supposedly took that too, right? Or is everything still fine?
t1_dsajrx0	1	*	Those billionaires are probably building entire safe bunkers/cities where they and their descendants can survive the coming hell.  At least, thats what Id do if I had their money.
t1_dsaj13w	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dsatwcs	1	*	Each of those things by themselves are common knowledge. Say them all at once an people think you're paranoid
t1_dsabzp6	0	*	If you believe that money is power, then look at the distribution of wealth & you see serious problems
t1_dsb56n9	1	*	how much risk do you personally have to face before you start considering violence against them in person?

t1_duvj78k	0	*	And most people are members of the Party.

t1_dsfg86v	1	*	But then they'd just kill the athletes before they even have a chance to compete D:
t1_dsfvbal	1	*	It's my understanding that Israel is widely suspected to have nuclear weapons.
t1_dsffot5	1	*	If you back a dog in a corner they will bite.  If they have nothing to fall back on then what will stop them from dropping a nuke in a populated area in a nearby country?
t1_dsfgtn1	0	*	It'd be very interesting to see what happens when hyper-capitalist SK unites with basically 3rd world military dictatorship NK.
t1_dsfkfiv	1	*	Inbefore they kill all their athletes for getting disqualified.   Edit: spelling also /s
t1_dsfpj21	1	*	No they don't. Please stop spreading misinformation. It makes genuine criticisms of North Korea look less credible.
t1_dsfhie8	1	*	Well not even a whisper of peace until now. 
t1_dsggtbv	1	*	As the other comments already mentioned. That isn't near the worst he done.
t1_dsfi3ck	1	*	Does anyone read sources anymore? Lmao
t1_dsfepgn	1	*	International relations is not based on pride. Let them throw a tantrum. Who cares???   And threat of war is much better than actual war. I don't want to live anywhere else but SK.
t1_dsfa5f7	1	*	The training regimen tho...
t1_dsfh36i	0	*	And invading them won't solve shit either.
t1_dsfghp2	1	*	Yep. And less troubles now that the archenemy didnt qualify either.
t1_dsft84c	0	*	We could lift any sanctions we gave on them with terms for more human rights and/or cooperation.  It would be a start.
t1_dsftm6x	1	*	It is unlikely you will be nuked. What won't be fine would be the economic and political structure of the world if Trump decides to attack NK. 
t1_dsfhnnv	0	*	Wow, this is last sub I expected to see that.
t1_dsfhchj	1	*	> hyper advanced  > North Korea  Pick one.
t1_dshppif	1	*	Yeah I mean I was sure being naive about what I was saying yesterday huh. 
t1_dsfv9z2	1	*	From 21 to 24 inches in under an hour.  At this rate, he'll be around 188 feet by the time the olymics start (conservatively).
t1_dsfvdqq	1	*	Yeah, the 'my button is bigger' twitter spat really caused a lot of people to re-evaluate their Poe detection algorithms. 
t1_dsfhzl3	0	*	Sure, the Kim family has no interest in dissolving the regime.  But if other NK officials could be guaranteed a seat of power, I'm sure there would be many interested in a hypothetical reunification. 
t1_dsfi5v7	1	*	I assumed only the US does that.
t1_dsfg4p4	1	*	Who says they will pay them? They'll be forced to work or 3 generations of their fanily will be sent to labor camps.
t1_dsfsvwq	1	*	Read that last part
t1_dsfh047	1	*	North Korea should drop the nukes and focus on their androids then. Super realistic looking but still not winning at Ping-Pong. They could be on to something. 
t1_dsffvq0	0	*	You could get speculative answers to this, but nobody knows. It's dependent on a million variables.
t1_dsgplu3	0	*	US has no idea what the heck it wants in Korea in long term end game.
t1_dsficmd	1	*	Aren't most of the shorter routes over the North Pole and Canada? Not across the Pacific? Of course California is at risk, but I was just wondering?
t1_dshl0u8	1	*	Damn, then I'm wrong I guess. I'm not used to liking something he did but I'll never root against peace. I hope this works out. 
t1_dsfg654	1	*	My point isn't about their attacking the games... Everyone is just giving them what they want (to partake). Once that's over nothing will change. 
t1_dsfahr5	1	*	Wiff Waff, surely?
t1_dsfr537	0	*	What about Fin's law? Or Rey's law?
t1_dsfg216	0	*	They elected the god damned moon? Crazy bastards... It just might work.
t1_dsfs5y2	1	*	No it's not.      They meant they kill them when they become more lose. Loosing. 
t1_dsfhbhq	1	*	And competitive anal sex.

t1_dsflkm5	1	*	San Diegan here, I completely agree with this.
t1_dsfmohz	1	*	The world has never had problems with suicide bombers? 
t1_dsfqt8e	1	*	Well on the plus side NK nukes probably can't reach main land USA.  Poor Hawaii or Guam tho. 
t1_dsfwcec	0	*	Shh don't worry my child it's ok :)

t1_dt7pigo	0	*	Whatever you think of Boris' politics or his demeanour, he is not an idiot.   I think it's a bit too early to call on Trump. Yes he's a complete liar but whether he's thick I'm not convinced. 
t1_du6a9qi	0	*	Most fan fiction says it went back. MGM should really settle this, but instead we get a prequel. *Sigh

t1_dt2ym9b	0	*	Yeah, no. I don't have a problem with any race doing an Indian accent. Accents can be funny, attaching some arbitrary racial stigma to them is retarded.

t1_dt33xdu	1	*	Yeah I'm sure it was absolutely necessary for ol Donnie to imitate an accent to convey the meaning of a very serious meeting between the two. Go fool someone else.

t1_dt36y06	1	*	I dunno.. seems like we are veering into where a guy would have to wear a dead baby as a dick ornament to be deemed ineligible for the POTUS. Pretty low bar.

t1_dt307bj	1	*	So you're saying it's no surprise then?
t1_dt35hdo	1	*	This from one who thinks someone who is constantly criticized, largely unfair, could have a fragile ego. Your use of words like cheeto expose your own insecurities.

t1_dt361ea	1	*	I never realized before how similar condemning and commending sound, for being antonyms.

t1_dt35qpq	0	*	I'm saying a country that faces a problem with street shitting and disposal of corpses doesn't have much latitude to criticize America.   Are you Cathy Newman?

t1_dt30fcl	1	*	No they don't. They are different accents. Both countries have multiple accents too and no two of them sound the same.
t1_dt3zom1	0	*	Many languages spoken in India don't belong to the Indo-European group (some in Europe don't, either).
t1_dt312aj	1	*	I have got an american accent. Being too much online has caused this. Don't watch many British shows. Derry girls is cool tho.
t1_dt33uaa	0	*	I'd say most people would claim racism even if the person imitating the accent WASN'T doing so mockingly. People would be offended as long as the person imitating is white.
t1_dt34f9l	0	*	I think that was the joke 
t1_dt34sx2	1	*	I think it's a pretty common thing outside the Americas. I have friends from Iran that all speak at least 2 or 3 languages.  Here I am, struggling to learn passable conversational Spanish lol.

t1_dtnzla2	0	*	To summarize the gist in a sentence:  The sketchy bank involved with Prevezon is the same sketchy bank involved with Trump and Co.  That's the connection.

t1_du6qjhl	0	*	Yeah, I'm going to pass accepting any non nuanced answer as just facts.  
t1_du5w5yz	1	*	yes but it slows your reaction time, can slow quick thinking, and hinders coordination a tiny bit. Nothing like being drunk though.

t1_duk3lt2	1	*	> It's almost impossible not to lie to a skilled interrogator.  Not if you're telling the truth.
t1_dukcdb7	1	*	It's money, not politics. He's probably broken many laws with his businesses over the years.
t1_dtiurku	0	*	Do you not feel like that could easily change very quickly, though?
t1_dtinl1s	0	*	Move those goalposts pal. This imperial, colonial, apartheid, racist 8 year old French Jew got what he deserved for stealing from the poor helpless Palestinians. Right?
t1_dtfm0qp	0	*	Maybe not a crime, but blatantly lying for Trump is hardly ethical.
t1_du1lj2c	0	*	Figured. Just conjecture.   6/10 for your mental gymnastics. I've seen better. 
t1_du2dpcg	1	*	almost like theyre all hypocritical monsters
t1_du20z3j	1	*	Passing refers to not being visibly or detectably a minority.   Trans people pass as their desired gender.  Some mixed race people can pass as white.  In this case, a gay or bi man passes as straight.
t1_du1jcjn	0	*	If being told that I don't deserve to have a job or a home or a family or a community because I was born gay isn't offensive, nothing is.

t1_du23ohn	0	*	I read every word.   It was very well written, and very informative.  If people cant take the 5 minutes to read it, they werent going to read a shorter version either.

t1_du1pzrf	0	*	Thats that group with the rape song right 
t1_du1dmim	1	*	Not every, but many out of respect for other nations.  Notice how the Germans showed appreciation for the host country by having the athletes carrying little korean flags and german flags.

t1_du1wviq	1	*	16 maybe... 
t1_du483us	0	*	The way you put it sounded like he favoured the electric chair for gays. Gay conversion (not conversation!) is stupid, but electrocution is not an essential part of it.
t1_du1qf0k	1	*	Would give you gold but I'm poor so I'm just saying this instead.
t1_du23un9	1	*	Over half the country is still trying to figure that one out.....
t1_du1p629	0	*	That would turn it into a dramatic shit show. It seems America has lost all sense of diplomacy 
t1_du1lpos	0	*	You may be correct. I'd like to hear what official policy would be also. I do doubt it though.

t1_du1kut3	1	*	Well it is the state that is home to Gary Indiana

t1_du1w15y	0	*	I think you are wrong, but ok
t1_du1qax3	0	*	Off of straight people, it's pretty obvious a lot of people get real uncomfortable when they can't blame homophobia on being closeted

t1_dsbnyy0	0	*	Or it could be that people eat more than they should.... It's not exactly rocket science. Westerners are just gluttons. 
t1_dsc0ytd	1	*	> I also don't like taxes being used by the government as a form of coercion.  Why not? That is what they are for.

t1_ducym60	1	*	We should. We should become isolationist indeed. In this we are agreed.

t1_du7ijai	0	*	So Guantanamo Bay it is then?

t1_du6wmnu	0	*	Such an accusation would have to be credible. I'm arguing that extradition from Sweden to the US, a country that does not protect the right to life, is a credible risk.
t1_du73uv8	1	*	> They went from being relatively unbiased leaking of information  He was never unbiased. Right from the beginning Wikileaks editorialized their releases.

t1_dsbh4yb	1	*	You have a sober view of the issues and I respect that. Accurate understanding will find a fix to the problem im sure (in the end). 
t1_dt83rek	0	*	She's not an MPP, though. She resigned her seat after she lost.  I liked Elliott, too, though, particularly her stand on nuclear energy.
t1_dt8sfj5	0	*	Fiscally conservative, progressive socially. But it turned out they were just a party that was mildly right leaning, who kept losing elections.

t1_duaao6c	1	*	...lmfao
t1_dt08z8h	1	*	It's also a shock absorption thing. Keeping the fetus encased in a fluid that is almost as dense as the fetus means that there aren't any sudden changes during development.
t1_dt09qsg	1	*	The myth is not about that but that a human fetus goes through our past evolutions, i.e. from microbe to fish and so on. It has been debunked, though.

t1_du211op	1	*	Tried recruiting with nearby technical schools? I figure you probably have but that's the best idea I can offer. Those are people who want to work and a clear path for them is a godsend.

t1_dsyi3i4	1	*	Not even all republicans voted for the bill, 5 of them voted no. 5 Democrats also voted yes.

t1_dut2f6k	1	*	You need to get education on the rivers in China. You speak about top-notch job as far as environmental safety goes. Most rivers in China are completely fucked. Top notch my ass 
t1_dut73a8	0	*	As an american, I think it wouldnt be that bad to start with that. Different perspectives are needed, especially in a time like this.

t1_dutdb3m	1	*	Lol and who the hell are you! Some uneducated pleb Im sure 
t1_dut4iii	1	*	Ikr and add the pollution and try to walk outside. 
t1_dut8yf0	1	*	China actually has a tremendous amount of protests
t1_duta4oi	1	*	I apologize if I insinuated Trump being an authoritarian leader, because he's not. He wants to be, but he isn't and we have enough checks and balances that he couldn't be.
t1_dutbev7	1	*	And from influential rivals within the House of Saud.
t1_dutlyjg	1	*	state capitalist is more accurate
t1_dusx458	1	*	There weren't public elections in the first place. Xi didn't run in an election against an opponent, he was selected by other senior party leaders.
t1_dut4l69	1	*	He never said they were near downfall, he said they were on the path to downfall. Kinda out words I'm his mouth there.
t1_dusz7kz	1	*	It is a bit insane how much he has posted in only 40 days of being on Reddit though.
t1_dut55db	1	*	Or his consistent desire for control and lack of understanding of how our government is supposed to work... I'm not full of hate filled fantasies.
t1_dut5k43	1	*	You don't need to worry about term limits when you control who your political opponents are and the voter outcome *touches head*
t1_dutntib	0	*	funny you mention this. CCP was an ally of Chang's party until he started to slaughter everyone in CCP for holding leftist/liberal political views.  Talk about poor decision making.
t1_dut3seb	1	*	For a long time chinesr families would kill or abandon their baby girls. Google it
t1_dut4qwg	1	*	Nah not really. Its definitely more centralized over other systems though. Some people like to call it state capitalist.

t1_dusvrlf	0	*	I assume he means he's a low grade dictator rather than a take over the world type. 
t1_dutg3n7	1	*	As an American, I agree. Often times people forget how big the world really is, or that there are entire other cultures, languages, and countries out there.
t1_dut5y8t	1	*	Or his inevitable successor is much worse but there are is no longer a term limit so the new dictator can much easier do horrible things.
t1_dut19gp	1	*	You are using words that Democracies use but not adding context.  The party congress is not elected by the people either. Nobody in that federal government is elected by the people.
t1_dut1g3p	1	*	You're absolutely insane. Lol
t1_dut8pql	1	*	Hindsights a bitch, aint it.

t1_dut3cub	0	*	Then they better get ready for one bloody revolution bc thats what it would take.  And you know their leaders would go ham on violence to quell it.  The Chinese population should be terrified.  
t1_dut4eby	0	*	I also watched the last John Oliver friendo
t1_duszwwu	1	*	What about Trump? He doesn't have authoritarian rule.
t1_dusxul3	0	*	Policing involves maintain your order of law. The Cold War and Vietnam were proxy wars for the proliferation of Capitalism (our law) over Communism.
t1_dut3a48	1	*	I shouldn't be laughing but....  In all seriousness, I honestly think internationally we are regressing, not evolving.
t1_dutbvih	1	*	interesting insight. THis reminds me of that cgp grey video.
t1_duthbjw	0	*	I don't think he's socialist enough to become another Mao in terms of ideology, I think he'd basically be a competent version of Putin.

t1_dut2nt7	1	*	I'm sure one of the countries' dictators he bribes will help to keep him safe. 
t1_dut0aup	0	*	Nomination is how a committee determines its leader.  Calling it an election is normalizing dictatorship.
t1_dut9uqk	0	*	>There's no way to no either way with the information we currently have  How do you know there's no way to know?   And why do you reject experiments like the Stanford prison experiment? 
t1_duu3z8x	1	*	> it's kind of surprising that rallies/marches/protests aren't a thing in China  China is autocratic. Protests (large ones, anyway) get you arrested.
t1_duu7gld	0	*	sorry i dont think thats a chinese proverb....it sounds like a meme or popular words....
t1_dusxs2v	1	*	 Agreed. 
t1_duto9n4	1	*	You know, you can recognize that other people don't know what they're talking about even when you're not well informed? It's not claiming superiority. 
t1_dussiwe	1	*	Not humanity, just this current civilization. We might move on to the stars, we might regress, but there won't be none of us.
t1_dusy80h	1	*	Not necessarily. Look at Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew ruled Singapore for 3 decades and turned it from a third world country into a first world country.

t1_dsk87tz	0	*	Do you think they would get a morale boost from a Trump visit though? They'd have to listen to him rambling about how amazing his victory against Crooked Hillary was.

t1_dtbqv7g	1	*	Oh yeah, because it's only possible for an American to be bigoted.  Surely there's no racial tension in Europe, they LOVE the middle east...
t1_dtbx6xg	0	*	So what does winning the war mean to you then? Or should they just stay there forever?
t1_dtbwzdj	0	*	I really can't imagine how exhausting it is to be that cynical.
t1_dtbwrav	0	*	That is a statement on the definition of terror attack more so than a statement about their behavior. Refugees do commit violent crime including murder. 
t1_dtbyrd3	0	*	I think you're confusing the way things *are* with the way things *should be.*
t1_dtbogl2	0	*	Yeah it was. 
t1_dtcbp5s	1	*	Majority of the war was like this in Iraq/Afghanistan. The actual civilian casualties that arent spoken about are over 100,000+. They fuckin hate us and they should.
t1_dtc34h3	1	*	If you think its at the same scale as islamic extremism you are delusional....
t1_dtbwxky	1	*	Just like literally every single commenter in this thread is doing?
t1_dtbyth2	0	*	Just like people care more about their families than about strangers. Headline could read The equivalent of one sixteenth of one of your parents were killed in Afghanistan today.

t1_dtbz8zw	1	*	>Asian countries care more for Asian countries   Let me just stop you right there.
t1_dtbzzdx	1	*	The crusades were a defensive response to massive Islamic invasion. And again, Jesus never told his followers to chop heads off and take slaves. Mohammed did and his followers have obeyed. 
t1_dtc0bu3	1	*	It's kind of a bigger deal for the rest of the world because pissing off the United States isn't wise considering the size of our military.

t1_dtbw6hw	1	*	Apples filled with spiders.
t1_dtbsapq	1	*	The taliban killed a lot of people when they were in power. Suicide bombing is just another way of getting rid of their enemies.

t1_dtc68o1	1	*	Mainly because disease isn't evil and doesn't willingly cause strife (at least as far as we know).  Humans, do. 
t1_dtbt2oe	0	*	We dont stone them, we just bicker over their rights as humans. Thats what makes Christianity a superior religion......
t1_dtbwicd	0	*	Again you keep using atheist and secular as if they are the same thing and theyre not. Being secular doesnt mean youre an atheist.

t1_dtc9ogy	1	*	its stupid, cheesy, makes 0 change just like petitions. if you actually want to help  donate to foundations that there are to help survivors of such attacks.
t1_dtby4qr	1	*	It's so nonsensical. Terrorism is a strategy, not an enemy. How do you declare war on a strategy? Might as well declare war on blitzkrieg, or war on squad formations. 
t1_dtc8csj	0	*	what's the point then? Those places are shit countries. And if you think otherwise, go live there

t1_dtm4hwe	1	*	> They don't believe in property ownership  Last time I checked, all communist leaders were rich while the people under them weren't. What a strange coincidence.
t1_dtm4ra2	0	*	Sure, but they are all monsters. Stalin, Hitler, Castro, Che, Mussolini, Maduro... all monsters.
t1_dtlyu99	1	*	And your grand refuge and safe heaven the US made it that way. Cuba was fucked politically no matter what happened.
t1_dtm7g13	1	*	> Cause Hitler was better?! to defend Stalin  isn't that actually true though
t1_dtm02pu	0	*	Capitalism works better on paper than it does in reality too, but I only ever see this argument made against socialism/communism.
t1_dtmhssm	0	*	Because I can still criticize something even if it's expected.
t1_dtm5c08	1	*	It's probably more because as a passenger you want to die in the crash and not after when the reactor containment fails.

t1_dtz2ffc	0	*	You joke, but that's probably why
t1_dtz5c4u	1	*	no it wasn't a decline, but a slowdown. And it was incredibly small given it's size. There's no decline...at all

t1_dtxcmcq	1	*	It doesnt work that way, they have already invested in other areas. It might hurt them, but not by a lot. 
t1_dtxemvd	1	*	Will do next time, and the next time please make a related argument about the article itself so we can discuss it with you also.

t1_dtp7r60	1	*	The difference being that the confederates worked military miracles.
t1_dtpqn8e	0	*	By saying: nobody cares, what's your point in posting this? It seems to me that's absolutely irrelevant
t1_dtogfdb	0	*	> Merkel is even trying to strong-arm Poland into letting large numbers of hostile foreigners into the country.  Well, good point, except *that* sounds like what a fascist sympathizer would say.
t1_dtojnme	0	*	You can bring some isis members for re integration into Canada. That's what liberals do so I guess it's normal. 
t1_dtouzdh	0	*	Haven't Italy and Spain had African immigration for roughly the entirety of recorded history? I mean, your really hardcore American racist barely even counts Italians as white.
t1_dtolevc	1	*	But white people ultimately migrated from Africa and are the same species as all other color of people; all of which decend from primate ancestors. Those insults really could be directed at anyone.
t1_dtog6tl	0	*	dude checkout the census or next time you apply for a job and they ask you what group are you? a lot of places have some middle eastern and indian in the white/caucasian area.
t1_dtoi2g9	1	*	>Supporting a football club has nothing to do with politics or ideology.  Yea, totally agree on that, I thought you weren't Italian and was giving you some context.   
t1_dtonhh4	1	*	lol well put.

t1_dtohas1	0	*	No worries, you have better english skills than many native speakers. 
t1_dtohf0y	1	*	Depends on your definition of white.  Originally, white only meant anglo-saxon or nordic.  Today, white means anyone who looks like they're descended from Europeans.
t1_dtoysec	1	*	The difference is that they don't really have racism (atleast not towards white-looking people), but more they try to actively avoid foreigners because foreigners cause problems.

t1_dtp4ple	1	*	I don't think they are invading your country
t1_dtot14c	1	*	So what will be gained by debating black-on-black crime on a majority white website with so many users outside the US and zero political power? 
t1_dtp426j	1	*	Ah.  We're a little jaded regarding shootings in America.  If an official made an announcement like that here, it would probably kick off a low-level race riot.
t1_dtokdh3	1	*	They didn't say that, just that they dislike Breitbart.
t1_dtok65a	0	*	Alternatively, replace ethnicity/religion with political ideologies

t1_dtotnkg	0	*	Youre an idiot.

t1_dty3eiv	1	*	I'm not saying one side or another is in the right. Geopolitics is generally despicable all around. Just pointing out why it's understandable for the DPRK to have pursued nuclear weapons development.
t1_dtxmzw2	0	*	It's the verb conjugation of sum/esse. usually done to a song as a mnemonic device (e.g. mexican hat dance). kind of a high school latin class meme.

t1_dujquvj	1	*	They can, just comes with risks.  Youll see non-central sources do it all the time.  Those that want to at least appear unbiased prefer to avoid it.
t1_dujm9mc	1	*	fuck
t1_dujvdh6	1	*	Believe me
t1_dujmxc4	1	*	That is assuming you actually cares about truth, morality and ethics. If you don't, why the fuck will it bother you to lie for your boss?
t1_dujj8n9	1	*	Some truth to this, but the big issue that swayed the election is abortion. Amazing how little play this gets, but there are SO many single-issue voters who will not consider a pro-choice candidate.
t1_dujktff	1	*	Trump does not need Russian help to make the  country hate him.
t1_dujrt4c	1	*	What institutions are those? I am curious.
t1_dujsdp5	1	*	Yeah this is the point there is no way out that doesnt harm us even further. We are screwed. 
t1_dukioyq	1	*	Dont forget the contributions of Gaius Marius in changing legislation to allow himself to stay in power longer. Definitely paved Caesars way.
t1_dujrcgr	1	*	...which is why I struck out the wrong info and put fixed because since writing that comment I realized I was wrong
t1_duk8sp9	0	*	and what would the charges be?
t1_dujuooj	0	*	IMO it's because people pick the specific study that matches their opinion and don't budge from it. They use critical thinking until it matches their views like a bunch of modern day Anselms.
t1_dujmg6o	1	*	Caesar also had a son with Cleopatra. So that was a thing that prompted that whole war with the Egyptians. Cleo wanted her son to have his birthright. Fun stuff. 
t1_dujj1w5	1	*	Maybe but it isnt a for sure thing. Trump even said his own evaluation of his wealth changes based on his mood.
t1_dujzjx8	1	*	He drinks a whiskey drink
t1_dukcnzt	0	*	Kim kardashian isnt a ceo but her family are geniuses at marketing and have made hundreds of millions off of just being worth talking about.

t1_dujse3s	1	*	Well I mostly use mobile but that looks useful. There's gotta be a mobile version.
t1_dujrqar	0	*	Yeah but does that make a difference? That only scratches the surface. Trump did lots of things. He just gets underestimated. 
t1_dujodew	1	*	The internet killed journalism.

t1_dugf55n	1	*	Yes. I know some. 
t1_dtj2cpy	1	*	Good thing I don't do those things. 
t1_dtj332w	0	*	If you have a foreskin dry masturbation does not reduce sensitivity fyi.
t1_dtjz0bp	1	*	Two shitty ideas, but I think cornflakes are worse. 
t1_dtj3m52	1	*	Perhaps you should take a survey of intact men who are willing to have their foreskin cut off and how OK they'd be with that for health reasons (as opposed to religious ones).
t1_dtj16vi	1	*	He's being sarcastic 
t1_dtjf0qk	1	*	No.  Babies aren't given pain meds for circumcisions. 
t1_dtjled9	1	*	Uh, yes it did. Not just in weird African countries - in the west, at least into the 50s.   Go read if you want to get angry.
t1_dtj89nk	0	*	...what? You don't know who does and doesn't.

t1_dtjn9bx	0	*	Better to be safe than sorry.
t1_dtpavvm	0	*	I have no recollection of the event. Did yours happen as an adult? Sounds like the procedure was messed up. Isn't possible to surgically repair?
t1_dtk768d	1	*	Well, except stupid-looking two-tone circumcised messes.
t1_dtjmcsa	0	*	Is it your penis? If yes, feel free to have whatever cosmetic surgery you want. If not, don't force cosmetic surgery on someone else.
t1_dtjay3v	0	*	Do you believe this applies only to male circumcision, or to any surgical body modifications that a parent might choose to have on their child, provided they're harmless long term?
t1_dtkoo67	0	*	do u have skin on end of pp??
t1_dtjiids	1	*	No that can't be because if people actually had a choice it would never be done. 
t1_dtjqnts	1	*	Good point but I doubt it would stick and only boys would end up without their nipples.  And considering how male nipples are seem as useless, I bet it would catch up fast. In America at least.
t1_dtjkuae	0	*	We may not turn down sex, but you wont be getting a second date if its too extreme 
t1_dtj5jco	1	*	..yeah, I'm gonna need you to slice a little off, k?
t1_dtjgvog	1	*	Actually, there have been some pros, but that's mainly only worked in college with one night stands and casual hook ups.   Being in a long term relationship though has been bothersome.
t1_dtl309n	0	*	Bullshit. You put that shit forward as your own opinion. At least own it.
t1_dtk4tae	1	*	Fair enough. But there's still no need for it. Plus it's still harmful.
t1_dtk02ps	0	*	Lol U0001f602 I like mine cut looks so pretty 
t1_dtiyfgz	0	*	Its a cosmetic procedure due to religious belief.  Cosmetic in the sense it is not done for medical reasons but for the look. 
t1_dtjj9g9	0	*	But uncut penis does look like a deformity. 
t1_dtjggmp	1	*	...prettt sure the issue is tradition and a lack of clarity on the risk vs benefit determination.
t1_dtjquyi	1	*	Same. Am that friend.
t1_dtjs50q	1	*	Also theres a steroid cream to help the skin expand.
t1_dtixldz	1	*	Circumcised says Joe, aye says I a little bit off the top
t1_dtjwc57	1	*	He gave himself yogurt enemas. I'm sure there is some way to craft a pun on party pooper there.
t1_dtk1kxr	1	*	Still, if I had to choose between having it as a newborn or as an adult, in my next life, I'd pick newborn.
t1_dtj7y8k	1	*	That's an anti-circumcision website so it makes sense. 
t1_dtjamfr	1	*	Gramm crackers have the same origin too. 
t1_dtjxgb6	0	*	No, people don't like being told what to do...that's all
t1_dtjbmv8	1	*	I'm all for allowing 14 years old to get circumcised, as long as it is their own decision. That's Worlds apart from doing it to a baby
t1_dtkjrmb	1	*	Doesn't it make more sense to teach your child how to properly wash themselves? If my kid can't keep their hands clean the solution isn't to cut their hands off. 
t1_dtjghpu	1	*	How the fuck do you know that? Sounds like an unsubstantiated claim to me
t1_dtjc725	0	*	Are you sure you needed a full circumcision?  There are methods to stretch and loosen the foreskin.  
t1_dtke7z6	1	*	fuck off

t1_dtiylp0	0	*	>us circumcised men are not traumatised  I took the comment to mean that circumcised men were traumatized as infants, not that they remain traumatized as adults. 
t1_dtixd5f	1	*	right? It's literally never bothered me once.
t1_dtjl3xf	0	*	While its wildly outdated there was a reason for it. If you were alive 200 years ago you wouldnt have this opinion. 
t1_dtjzwdi	1	*	Thats super stupid theres 0 benefit to it... 
t1_dtjma8n	1	*	Yup I was agreeing. 
t1_dtipntn	0	*	Bull, any sane Bernie voter wouldnt meddle around in such a silly issue.  I think its a right wing x-tian thing, like abortion rights. It screams it.
t1_dtjlkic	1	*	Good news, a lot of women who have a chunk of their genitalia cut off feel the same way. 
t1_dtjmcbj	1	*	>lol my parents didnt take my future autonomy into consideration 
t1_dtjysht	1	*	Personally, I disagree. I feel that cosmetic procedures should ultimately be chosen by the person who will have to live with them. But I can respect that position. 
t1_dtjx7md	0	*	Dude you sound really ignorant. America is a large and diverse country. We are fucked up right now. We know it.  And if you are from England, you're country is pretty fucked up too.

t1_dtjpm88	0	*	By a long distance.
t1_dtj67bs	1	*	You only have one arm too?? 
t1_dtjx854	1	*	Yes, both an intact foreskin and poor hygiene increase the risk of yeast infections.  Also, vaccines save lives. 
t1_dtjg818	0	*	> But you aren't getting daily looks at European dudes' dicks if you are a Highschool kid from Wisconsin.  Well, this is why Reddit was created...
t1_dtj9l3g	1	*	I'd wager you never met my penis.
t1_dtjkpb2	1	*	You could make the same argument for raping and torturing them, too.   Only difference is you're using a knife for this.
t1_dtn1uuk	1	*	I think it was because it had happened before, but I didn't ask him too much about it because I still had to live with him for another couple months and didn't want it to get too awkward.
t1_dtjelty	1	*	He only invented corn flakes. He refused to add sugar cause it would make people too horny (seriously). His brother added sugar to the flakes and subsequently made all the money. 
t1_dtja9wb	1	*	Your whole body stinks if you don't shower, bro
t1_dtjae2u	1	*	I think it's mostly the mutilating babies part. Why not take the nipples too? Men don't need those.
t1_dtivyna	1	*	Well you were a baby at birth and wouldn't have been able to make that decision 
t1_dtjqsik	0	*	The dude, or the food?

t1_duz05kb	1	*	I do live around these people and have no bad experiences, only shitty experienced from neo-nazis on the S-Bahn . In fact Ive lived in immigrant communities in German and the UK.
t1_dv0ec76	0	*	Do you really try to gauge human decency by redit upvotes? Pathetic.
t1_duyuxyr	1	*	did they import American gun lunatics?
t1_duz2lnz	0	*	TIL Nazi Germany was socialist, just like the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is democratic, what a world!  Its true because they called it that!
t1_dv0vyvs	1	*	Oh yeah the far left are really the ones you gotta worry about.   They are real dangerous. 
t1_dv1orxt	1	*	Thank you! If GMOs hurt farmers then farmers wouldn't use GMOs. 
t1_dv156kf	1	*	> Honestly, to me it still feels like a good neighbour and friend walked out on us.  Canadian here. I know that feel...
t1_dv2aqji	1	*	The EU can't do a whole lot about corruption in individual state members. Plus corruption exists everywhere. 
t1_dv0rmff	1	*	Top economists kind of brought that on themselves by pushing neo-liberalism really hard for a really long time.  
t1_dv2ab20	1	*	Here is the truth. 
t1_dv0qf67	0	*	GMOs can help with literally all of those issues.   Did you know gmos have reduced pesticide use, and pollution from farming practises?
t1_dv1oe6b	1	*	> Glad to see Reddit's #1 Monsanto defender is on the case though.  who's that?
t1_dv1ds4v	0	*	Yes. It's about more than the economy. It's about wanting to be friends.
t1_dv0z37e	1	*	I haven't seen any. I wanted to know what it was called.
t1_dv187pt	1	*	Yes that is exactly what I said. A plant treated with this systematic insecticide will give a dose to any bee that happens to forage. The bee will then return that dose to its colony. 
t1_dv0n2ks	0	*	Shit...
t1_dv0uvzk	1	*	Think how we feel. We're trapped in here with these mentalists.
t1_dv0xt98	0	*	Dude.
t1_dv0ngw1	0	*	The same shit applies in the US too.
t1_dv0zjsu	0	*	I wasn't talking about other countries, but if you would like to make a list you can do that.
t1_dv0ucgz	1	*	That's *exactly* what I said.
t1_dv110he	1	*	Colgate 
t1_dv0r9dc	1	*	Tbh, it doesnt help that said top economists screwed the entire country knowing what they were going to do (see 2008 US crisis).
t1_dv1b8a6	1	*	This. I used be pro GMO. In theory nothing is wrong with it. But I really dislike and distrust the commercial, monopolist possibilities. 
t1_dv1kuz5	0	*	I actually have not heard that, I'll have to look into it.

t1_dv1c7za	1	*	I'm not sure if you are saying what you think you are saying or if you are unsure how pesticides work.
t1_dv0v70k	0	*	Just remember there's a very significant part of Britain that wanted to stay, including myself.  The tiniest of majorities swayed a whole country into doing this drastic action.
t1_dv11t93	0	*	yeah, but Big Organic has obviously insidious capitalist profit-driven goals compared to Big Vegan, who just wants to save animals from suffering.
t1_dv13k4z	0	*	And many in the scientific community who have found them dangerous.  You have EFSA scientists being paid by Monsanto to speak on it's safety. Very trustworthy...
t1_dv10x01	0	*	Okay, you changed it and its still wrong.
t1_dv0qu02	1	*	A meritocracy is unlikely to break up monopolies.  You keep what you kill and all that jazz.  Granted, a meritiocracy may be something completely different.
t1_dv2sda4	1	*	It would be cool if ancient bands like the Rolling Stones could keep doing concerts long after they're dead. Like the Tupac hologram except sentient.
t1_dv0px6a	0	*	I just wish that a Norwegian would actually explain to Trump why they're actually not interested in emigrating to the US.
t1_dv0r1lt	1	*	If they didn't want them they wouldn't buy them and the industry wouldn't be viable. 
t1_dv18e8r	0	*	Yes. When the workers feed the queen those small doses add up. It would be far better for the bees if the insecticide killed the bee in the field at time of exposure.
t1_dv1hswn	1	*	Yes. This is actually my specific vaccine account. If you go to my submitted post history you'll see a lot of interesting stuff. 
t1_dv15afy	0	*	What show? 
t1_dv17gk3	1	*	As an Irish man raised on British comic, both the page and tv, it's a massive loss
t1_dv0pfg4	1	*	Algorithms used today can identify objects by using multiple linked features, such as colour of clothes, the trajectory, etc. It's much harder to fool something like that.
t1_dv1j9hv	1	*	Thanks - I didn't know treated seeds were an issue. 
t1_dv17k4d	1	*	Nobody did say the EU was perfect anyways, though.  The saddest part of it all is that, instead of working to change the EU for the better, you guys just jumped out.
t1_dv0zh92	0	*	Monsanto admits to using neonicotinoids on seed coating pesticides and claims banning them would do more harm than good.  But looks like I was wrong on Roundup, my bad.

t1_dua4328	0	*	The US can't even keep trains on the track...let alone offer high speed, or economic fares  
t1_du8nd9i	1	*	The delay between late trains here in New York can sometimes be so great you can catch trains you have missed by several minutes by catching g later connecting trains.
t1_du91z8s	1	*	I am paying 189 in sachsen-anhalt (saxonia-anhalt?) and the ticket also includes free public transport in the MDV-Zone (includes all of the city, most of sachsen-anhalt and a bit into saxonia)
t1_du8ubj4	1	*	You done goofed

t1_du8950o	1	*	Well, the weiner advantage is often an unmentioned thing.
t1_du9c1n9	1	*	Wanna make a bet for yes or no answers? Is the DC metro on fire today? 
t1_du8bftg	1	*	But this is the point, the car is cheap and easy to use. Increasing the costs on the car would have far greater effects than decreasing the costs of PT. 
t1_du8ua0r	1	*	Ahhh the old higher education switcheroo

t1_duvbpi0	0	*	Elaborate?
t1_duv48bx	0	*	Thanks. Would need more information because I can't read the paper. What defines very small ?  Even then, we have the report from Lower Saxony that directly refutes this. 
t1_duvd5ic	1	*	It would be great to have more up-to-date data, but why would you assume migrants to be different now?

t1_ds1pyc5	1	*	If you're talking about the wage gap myth, then yes.
t1_dtbju56	1	*	Very true! I should have /s, as I was just teasing. You made me laugh with the point about the sky :)
t1_dunhgsa	0	*	Ah, fun with stats. Did you know that on average, all humans have one testicle?   The problem is not with your facts, the problem is with your interpretation of them, the context, the history.
t1_dumecxm	1	*	Polllllka, polllllllka! You heard it?!
t1_dulnerq	1	*	It's called diplomacy.  If the US politicians manged to uphold a decent level of diplomacy throughout the Cold War with the Soviets then I think they can do that with NK.
t1_dul6zy5	1	*	And decent odds say he is a closeted homosexual, considering the general trend of such strongly anti gay politicians in the us.
t1_dultqks	1	*	the U.S regularly shakes hands with leaders that oppresses and kills their people and even sells them billions in arms so they can continue too do so.  not an argument to not at least try diplomacy.

t1_dtue4u9	1	*	Are you arguing in favour of false reporting of sexual assaults? I'd just like to be clear before I go off on you.
t1_dtamyc4	1	*	Flushing once per day might be annoying but its not a huge thing to ask - 50L of water per day is plenty if youre conscious about it.
t1_dshy6rd	0	*	Funny that you think more is required.

t1_dtzogh8	1	*	Right but the opinion piece is falsely implying that there is no evidence that the Assad regime used chemical weapons. When that is clearly the consensus.
t1_dtbjg55	0	*	How are you supposed to get stuff done when  everything is closed after you get off work?

t1_dsouagn	1	*	Either is Wallstreet.

t1_dsr9o3g	0	*	Thanks for the job idea mate.
t1_du2bm9c	0	*	India can only become a vassal of US like Japan, being enemy of US would mean the end of  India.  India doesn't have any power to go other way.
t1_dsd9s3k	1	*	I'm not your buddy, cowboy. 
t1_ds3pige	0	*	HTTPS protects against DPI. They can't see anything. Otherwise they could MITM you when you visit your bank website and steal all your funds.

t1_du13m3s	1	*	If you base your assumptions on Fox and Trumps twitter, he still comes off as a bad joke, and people would still laugh at him.
t1_du11hoa	1	*	Trump has all the aptitudes to be one. 
t1_du11vnx	1	*	To be fair, Hillary started that.   But yeah, Trump really latched onto that one and ran with it.

t1_duf5tjv	1	*	> is letting him out after 11 years even safe for the rest of us?  How could we possibly make that call now? Thats why its a minimum with a review at that stage. 
t1_dufcc6h	1	*	No we shouldn't let him back in. We should put him down and not give him the chance. Rapists don't deserve rehabilitation. Even murder can be justified but rape never is. Kill every rapist.
t1_dtotid6	1	*	Yes
t1_dumuk2e	0	*	And what do you think the response to that would be? I would like my kids to have a future and you?
t1_duo4rdw	0	*	So it was just sarcasm, correct? No one actually thinks that he meant that right?
t1_dun8kt4	1	*	He should learn using /s at least then all of the autistics(people that can't detect sarcasm) can understand that it was sarcasm...
t1_ds6ddlh	0	*	Based on the rest of the comment, I'm pretty sure he was implying Pakistan made him stay inside (e.g. Use of locked in instead of purely stating that he never left).
t1_ds8aprl	0	*	You have it completely backwards. I've looked it up and it's Ben very widely cited about Ontario electricity rates. And fossil fuels Are cheaper.  You are wrong and trolling. 
t1_dto5fzk	1	*	And oil!
t1_dtohmko	1	*	Protein.
t1_dtn3d4e	0	*	Unfortunately, not the current life. Every extinction cycle wipes out so many beautiful creatures, never to be seen again. :(
t1_dsbfzj3	1	*	What if we promise to take prince Charles as well? Take him out of the line of succession for you?
t1_dsbgfpc	1	*	Again, for clarity, my first not a scientifically exacting statement, nor was it meant to be.
t1_du7cg43	1	*	So you acknowledge your goal is to restrict certain people and entities from posting what they want on the internet? How would you accomplish that?
t1_ds44643	1	*	Yeah but we're their boss too though. 
t1_dujx2am	1	*	I can't help but think that this is part of a plan ... leave seats open so that he can freely fill them at will with himself/whoever he pleases.  The UN especially worries me.
t1_dujlriq	0	*	Got any ideas why ASEAN is set up that way? Like, why can't it just be ambassadors in Vietnam, Thailand, etc. We have embassies in those countries.
t1_dujvq5x	0	*	Yes, he's the House pinhead and inside joke, along with his brother Qusay.
t1_dujiw14	1	*	I dont even think hes afraid shell run, I think he wants her to run because hes confident hed beat her 
t1_dujt9yx	1	*	Please don't underestimate indian diamond merchants
t1_dum4nae	1	*	Nah, as I explained; have some trouble finding out sarcasm vs stupid people around here. Apparently, both can actually coexist within the same person --my bad :) 
t1_du0bboo	1	*	What's the DOW at today?
t1_du0wwdy	1	*	The squawk of another parrot who hasn't looked into what he says.
t1_dty5csb	0	*	The guy who you are replying to once said evidence and critical thinking shouldn't be taught in school because it would mean nothing new is created.
t1_dty15b4	1	*	That... sounds like a gross understatement.
t1_dt0b8ya	0	*	Maybe
t1_dssqobt	0	*	What was I generalizing? Im stumped
t1_dst8j5n	1	*	Tell me about it. I get one big red recycling bin and information about to put in it is so cryptic Alan Turing wouldnt be able to figure it out.
t1_dstv1nx	1	*	I'm joking, I'm not that stupid
t1_dtzda4m	1	*	to be fair, gandhi was referred to as mahatma because of his work and activism in south africa. 
t1_dtzxdph	1	*	The site says they learb holistic medicine doesnt specify herbal medicine but does specifically include chetalation treatments which are not within the scope of strict homeopathic practice
t1_dtypf88	1	*	Oh! Yea its a dragon type move! No wonder it is never effective against fairy types like homeopathy.
t1_dtzofe2	0	*	Did you only have massage?
t1_dtzgxyu	1	*	Where do I sign up?
t1_dtzcg6l	0	*	I have never looked into it...they really have stupid shit like that?
t1_dtyqzub	0	*	Brandy and water.  I wish I was kidding.
t1_dtz0act	1	*	I believe it helps to point out how bullshit it is even better.
t1_dtzrw3r	0	*	Prevent the flu.
t1_dtyv2yu	1	*	It does. There's a big difference 1 part per thousand and 1 part per billion.
t1_dtyznvw	1	*	5 seconds in and you get an A+
t1_dtyt9n7	0	*	Yeah, I admit to not knowing their thing besides lots of water, sugar, and flour.
t1_dtyqko2	0	*	Nah, a friend of a friend went to 30 seconds of a lecture. Am I qualified yet?
t1_dtyywj9	1	*	Sorta creepy isn't it?  You don't want to be sending your DNA to someone that doesn't even know you.  Edit for proofreading.
t1_dtykgsx	0	*	Lots of people won't even consider allopathic medicine until they are almost dead due to the ineffectiveness of homeopathy
t1_dtz5lni	1	*	See, science has already taken this concept and made it work.  It's called vaccines.
t1_dtyltnb	1	*	Yikes. Maybe they should require them to market it by it's other name: deadly nightshade.
t1_dtz121q	1	*	Awwww....
t1_dtytiis	0	*	> the desired dilusion factor  I'm not sure if you misspelled dilution or delusion here, because either way it works.
t1_dtyxqab	1	*	wow, so by dilutingg the substance with 10^118 more universes worth of matter we can reach a sufficient reasonable see a apparation pf ones former self?
t1_dtzyrg0	1	*	You mentioned Marx and Lenin, c'mon.
t1_ds3qmah	1	*	Accuracy is not relevant but I used this statistical data to prove my point! 
t1_ds3b90b	0	*	Yes it does.... You said it yourself they have to prove theyre innocent rather then the other people prove theyre guilty 
t1_dukzmkq	1	*	My comment looks like it was a reply to a different comment. Fixed for clarification
t1_ds3k4jy	1	*	yea i'm not some mouthbreather shorting meme stocks over on /r/wallstreetbets lol.   Hedging investments is such an inexpensive thing to do, it's silly not to in such instances.
t1_ds3yirt	0	*	This is literally the exact opposite of what you're proposing. Corporatists *love* H1B. This is a loophole they made to fulfill the dream you allege that closing it will cause.
t1_ds3nqhf	0	*	Fixing the abuse will most certainly result in far less H-1B visas.  If the H-1B visa holder fits all the true requirements set by the visa system then there is nothing to worry about.
t1_ds3q8m9	0	*	This is exactly what I mean. A lot of the Indian people that come over here are incredibly educated. Really surprised to find so many people don't share the same sentiment..
t1_dtq2hsj	1	*	What, you want to vote every month on every issue? Every week? Every day? Nothing would ever get done because the side that loses each vote would just call for another one.
t1_dtqm5h7	1	*	Which means it isn't now. 
t1_dtrfzbl	1	*	>they don't leave such crucial decisions to simple majorities  Funny, pretty sure all the other EU acts/votes held in the UK that made them part of that shitty project were simple majorities.
t1_dtqc9z8	0	*	So you're cool with another referendum down the road a year or two later again for all time, right?
t1_dtsnolx	0	*	So a proportional voting system similar to MMP like in Germany or New Zealand?
t1_dtq5q3u	1	*	I know you are but what am I?
t1_dtq0530	0	*	Donald Trump supporters dont have valid opinions?
t1_dtq61bg	1	*	To be fair, blocking the Net Neutrality vote isn't bad at all.
t1_dtpxjtj	0	*	Key word 'Simple', because if you use it you're simple.
t1_dtsh5v8	1	*	>  quite close family ties etc.  I've got blood relatives in NZ, Canada and Oz. Very true. One big colonial family.
t1_dtqkhwd	1	*	To most people it means the exact opposite. 
t1_dtq3ix5	1	*	That perception of thinking ones own country is the best in the world at literally everything is fairly unique to america especially in the west.
t1_dtq2zuc	0	*	volkswagen emissions?
t1_dtrwn08	0	*	I said irrational viewpoints and actions. There is nothing irrational about not wanting to pollute your environment. I would rather sit in a garage with an electric car running than a gasoline engine.
t1_dtrgw0r	0	*	Meh, everyone speaks English nowadays.  Business culture is becoming more and more globalized, too.  It has nuclear weapons and is in a easily defensible geostrategic location, though, so that's cool.
t1_dtqa1a9	0	*	> the UK is actually forecast to become the largest economy in Europe by the 2030s.  Thanks. So Germany will reach its current GDP in 2036. Thats a forecast that should be trusted.
t1_dtq4evi	1	*	I turned out to vote. I was just clarifying the 52% statement.
t1_dtrjwzx	0	*	I doubt it
t1_dt26j9o	0	*	That's basically what most modern syndicalists believe.
t1_dsdn2s7	1	*	I guess [this](https://xkcd.com/244/) one applies  
t1_dsdjtkr	1	*	Not necessarily. You have to take account the dosage. Considering the timeline of his steroid usage and the intensity he used it, it had at least some effect. 
t1_duww42a	1	*	woosh
t1_ds45bvy	0	*	Not at a presidential debate
t1_ds45e79	1	*	Just 1 tablespoon? C'mon!
t1_ds4iaxc	0	*	RT is Russian media. They write whatever Putin wants them to write. Just FYI. Could be true, but they do want to destabilize the world
t1_ds424ud	1	*	... then that's why we have the Trident programme.
t1_ds5e2q9	0	*	No it's not. You said Like all previous presidents have? How has that worked out? I'd like to know why you said that.
t1_ds48yqp	0	*	Brace for the ass load of reddit gold and karma that's about to come your way my friend. Also don't say *RIP inbox* when that happens.
t1_ds45xuv	1	*	and they're fucking imbeciles
t1_ds4ffsw	1	*	And his only achievements after a year are undoing things Obama did.
t1_ds9rk2d	0	*	Hey, long time no talk.   I hope Dubs is doing well.   Take care old friend!
t1_ds4dx3m	1	*	We missed out on guacamole Tuesday.
t1_ds4fly7	0	*	Wait.. are we the stein or the stain?

t1_ds470eq	1	*	Link?  For...science. 
t1_ds481wt	0	*	Yep and I shook it off and went to work the next day like a man. Didnt cry for impeachment every day. Youre gonna wake up tomorrow and find something new to whine about. Im gonna go do my job.
t1_ds469j4	1	*	too late.
t1_ds42cad	1	*	You say that as if he would acknowledge that anyone didn't love nuclear winter. Clearly, this is all the lies of the fake news. 
t1_ds4hzd5	1	*	Lol Americans wouldn't have gone to the moon if trump was president, they would have spent all their money on wars, building a wall and upgrading their coal plants
t1_ds45mxc	1	*	Dotard does not mean retarded. 
t1_ds49ljw	1	*	If its a liberal state thats attacked I guarantee you theyd be overjoyed, actually. 
t1_ds44pql	1	*	You are frighteningly stupid.
t1_ds476g6	1	*	You guys are like comparing two things but I am not sure of what words to use to describe it anymore
t1_ds491q4	1	*	Suddenly it makes sense that the zombies have ammo on their corpses.  
t1_ds3xkcx	0	*	I wonder how much it would cost to send complimentary kneepads to half of the Senate and most of the House? 
t1_ds4fmo5	0	*	How does voter ID suppress voters?
t1_ds484zb	1	*	(Bomb goes off)  quick everybody have sex now!  9 months later Xavier is born!
t1_ds4copt	1	*	You mean pick your own bubble of false reality.
t1_ds4an94	1	*	>I mean. Everything comes back to that  No, a good deal of it has to do with a vomitive state of politics + media, and if people dont realize that and do something about it it will 100% happen again
t1_ds4nhrm	1	*	Cool.  Don't come here.
t1_ds495ms	1	*	can you please wake up so this wild ride can end mr bones
t1_ds42pmh	1	*	Some men just want to watch the world burn.  
t1_ds495zd	1	*	Because that was exactly how it worked for Kansas, right?
t1_ds47zwv	0	*	Dont forget the movie Shazam... its better than youd think. 
t1_ds51no1	0	*	You assume China's government is rational. Since they've been protecting the Kim regime all these years, creating a gigantic humanitarian crisis on their own doorstep in the process, I doubt that.
t1_ds4yugv	1	*	Ok then, its something only children, or those with the mentality of children, would do.
t1_ds4ix04	1	*	Except when reddit's servers are destroyed due to the conflagration.  More like greatest asshole.
t1_ds48301	1	*	Dan Rather's musk blows his snout by Andrew's son.
t1_ds43lt1	0	*	Surprised?  If I woke up tomorrow with my head stapled to the carpet I wouldn't be more surprised than I am right now.
t1_ds48312	1	*	There was no war in Ba Sing Se.
t1_ds4d04d	1	*	Then let us hope Mueller takes his treacherous fat ass down.  Preferably *before* he unleashes nuclear war and kills everyone.
t1_ds4osyn	1	*	Trump may be incompetent when it comes to presidency, but he knows how to win. 
t1_ds5fzau	1	*	You may as well ask what if clouds were made of cotton candy, because the American media is definitely reporting it. 
t1_ds42ins	1	*	lol DildoDoucheBaggings is a total lunatic. 
t1_ds4gi46	1	*	Let's see the eggheads think their way out of this one.
t1_ds4kj5v	0	*	Yea, I may go to the uk or another english speaking country eventually, as learning a language is hard (though certainly not impossible)
t1_ds45nre	1	*	At least Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Comacho appointed smart people, and given his education he had a decent excuse for his ignorance.
t1_ds4qytk	1	*	Trump a smart guy? Lol
t1_ds43eyy	0	*	Yeah I was super scared for a hot second. Time to move to the burbs.
t1_ds42zb4	1	*	She had a lot of baggage, but as far as people you'd want sitting in the oval office and trying to bring about policy she was about the most qualified person you could find

t1_ds4crld	0	*	Obama is always invited, everywhere
t1_ds42qo8	0	*	Or MAYBE the reach was more that Trump's tweet is at ok, and not a fucking embarrassment.    
t1_ds44ws3	0	*	Its a great response. But normally you just upvote a great response. You dont copy and paste it exactly to the same person. Thats just weird. 
t1_ds4gxap	1	*	Is this how the Foundation and/or Second Foundation start?  Clearly Trump is the Mule...
t1_ds43qcs	1	*	I'll have you know that that is highly offensive.  Just because you have two other kids under your trench does not mean they're sucking your cock!
t1_ds4374x	1	*	this is fucking *barely* /s      that fucking idiot is unhinged.
t1_ds4se3a	1	*	Lol yeah that's it. Is that where we got the phrase?
t1_ds4adtc	1	*	Christ lol how far up your ass can you see right now 
t1_ds48ab8	1	*	TBF that person makes a great point. Using Twitter isn't the problem, it's more about how he's using twitter.
t1_ds4ezk4	1	*	And people ask why we can't find intelligent life elsewhere. 15 minutes on t_d and you doubt it's even on earth
t1_ds4agax	1	*	He basically called Macron gay because his youthful handshake hurt Trump's tiny hand
t1_ds42ry9	1	*	You don't think the aliens see this shit? They flew right past and didn't slow down.

t1_ds42lhe	1	*	Oh no I ain't getting involved in Space Feudalism. That's a whole different clusterfuck waiting to happen. 
t1_ds4hmzo	1	*	We've had threads about people predicting Trump's actions, don't joke about this.
t1_ds47d2d	1	*	and i thought trump said this.   lmao
t1_ds42kc8	0	*	Ding ding ding... someone give this guy gold. I'm also too lazy and unable to do the right thing atm
t1_ds41k8k	1	*	Exactly- youd think the president of all people would be especially likely to think America is great. 
t1_ds45j9j	1	*	I've been in a dry spell. So any rack will do at this point.
t1_ds4gpnm	1	*	It's like you don't understand that he's threatening retaliation, not aggression. Pretty simple stuff if you'd look at the fucking context.

t1_dsbcpde	1	*	Healthy in the biological sense? Not particularly. But visually there are still plenty of places that look as you'd expect. Although those are dwindling fairly fast.
t1_dsbhtzh	1	*	As long as you're not walking the city at night you'll be fine.  Go to the cayes or anywhere else but the city. I'm m from there. 
t1_dscg64m	0	*	Haha I don't think I saw one attractive belizean woman when I was there, so I can imagine you get what you pay for.

t1_dupbrq8	0	*	No. He will still be a jerk. We just need to go back and take his Grays Sports Almanac off him. 
t1_dudhvpn	1	*	You forgot Saddam Hussein, but yeah, that's a pretty good summary.
t1_dsyjits	1	*	That's what I mean. They're both immature. They both do it and act like it's only the others' fault.

t1_dt0w9bi	0	*	I know I walk down the street and see starving billionaires. Barely able to feed themselves let alone keep thier company afloat.   Do you have any clue how much 1 billion is? let alone 5 
t1_dv1vyub	0	*	A few percent on a bigger inflated number is better than the same percent on a smaller number. 
t1_dv1dm42	0	*	All trade deals have carve outs. Same with NAFTA, US-South Korea, etc.

t1_dv23qge	1	*	Bernie Sanders opposed NAFTA because it hurt Americans.  You do know this right?
t1_dv2as5s	1	*	Because of his supporters aren't Russian. They're racist. If not racist, sexist. If not sexist, xenophobic. If not xenophobic, a Democrat.

t1_dv351wc	0	*	I'm out of the loop, why was this downvoted?
t1_dv2xg2q	1	*	I am for getting rid of NAFTA and recreating it with just US/Canada. I don't think America gets an equal benefit with the trade in Mexico. 
t1_dv1qz6y	1	*	Well the guy that actually works in the industry disagrees with you. So...
t1_dv1xr6c	1	*	Until China says FU and undercuts the US market even more because they can

t1_dv1p93i	0	*	I feel like an explicit, open retaliation intelligently targeted at an acting President (who is a strong ally)  is very different than covertly spreading false propaganda...

t1_dv2nbmv	1	*	Right, it would've been great if a 3rd party or independent would've come in and swept the elections.
t1_dv26ph4	1	*	You missed the strained sniffs
t1_dv1uiwh	1	*	please, no
t1_dv1w6nn	0	*	Its only if you are buying foreign product today. 2/3 of steel in America is domestically produced. The tariff only applies to that other 1/3. 
t1_dv1mark	1	*	Hopefully someone fixes zone of control..

t1_dv1xhqa	1	*	The god damn cocksucker wants to *annex* Canada. 
t1_dv1r6k2	0	*	It's because American steel has an extra ingredient: freedom. Canada's steel is made with socialism instead. That's why it can be melted by jet fuel.
t1_dv2cifp	0	*	That assumes he wants to be re-elected, which I seriously doubt, he'll just withdraw from the next election claiming to be the greatest presitent the world has ever seen.

t1_dv2492c	1	*	Lol nice 
t1_dv2v7zr	1	*	Reminds me of how one infamous person, Leona Helmsley, once said only the little people pay taxes.  He was later busted and thrown in jail for tax evasion.
t1_dv1uc4a	1	*	They both make sense, if you're not an idiot.
t1_dv1guax	0	*	Tariffs don't create jobs, literally no economists think they do.
t1_dv1ek26	1	*	He said theres not enough of an industry in the US to make up for the slack that will need to be filled due to the Tariff.
t1_dv1qngv	1	*	It's not artificially low, in a free market it's just low.
t1_dv1qthh	0	*	To answer part of the edit, the EU could impose tariffs on the US as early as next week. The markets reacted so violently today because of the threat of a trade war.

t1_dv1m35x	0	*	I mean hemp is a pretty good product for a lot of things...
t1_dv283ks	1	*	That doesnt just happen though nor may it practical. We are a nation of thinkers and doers. I think we are beyond an economy of physical production of a thing. 
t1_dv1skkd	0	*	First debate against HC he said he either wanted or was happy with the GFC because he could buy low. Same debate he said he doesn't pay taxes because he's smart. He was so bad during those debates.

t1_dv1iyva	1	*	Yeah, and it cost the American people paying something like 1 to $2,000,000  PER steel working job created/secured 
t1_dv7fg3y	1	*	Its almost like theres a sizable portion of the population who will vote against their own interests (in the short or long term) as long as the resulting action will hurt someone else.
t1_dv1pjkv	1	*	Also the good folks on North Sentinel island?
t1_dv1sw9n	1	*	I was just thinking similar to that - this guy is our alternative to trading EU?! Hes a maniac!!

t1_dv280l4	1	*	A funny claim when the entire point is that the EU knew exactly how big a deal the orange industry was.
t1_dv1sayb	1	*	These days it does, in fact, take a Democrat to see it. Republicans left for the loony bin a long time ago. 
t1_dv1v0ds	0	*	Concise, informative, logical... just wanted to let you know I think this post was written beautifully. This is how I want to learn to write.
t1_dv1syq8	0	*	Hope to God you forgot the /s tag and are not really that stupid.

t1_dv3cl52	1	*	Yes, Republicans clearly care very deeply about the rust belt. That's why they shipped all those jobs overseas or automated them without any safety nets for the displaced workers. They care.

t1_dt1lwsz	1	*	the problem is that maybe now it is fair? But what happens when a government you don't like abolishes the speech you like?

t1_dsuk4nd	0	*	A written apology from the kid would be a good call, because it would teach her an important lesson to reflect on her lies. But I wouldn't expect her to be publicly identified. She's 11.
t1_dsv1ryz	1	*	The parents should absolutely blame her for lying to them, but that is none of our business tbh. The blame for making it a national story however? Yeah that is not on her.

t1_dtzl41a	1	*	Gotta call bullsh*! on that one my friend. See I typed it out but it changed by itself
t1_dtzpyn5	0	*	At that point it's not them, it's the people running these places, isn't it?
t1_dtzz4yh	0	*	Or they raise animals and nurture them until they are ready for the intended reason for their existence? You are a vegan cliche.
t1_dtzrtt1	1	*	Have you tried the beyond burger?
t1_dtzyugr	1	*	Well the only reason A wants to kill C is because C looked at his wife once. B just needs a job as unemployment is about to run out and B has mouths to feed.
t1_dtzkibp	0	*	Agreed. Subbed.   I'll make sure to post actively. 
t1_dtzz82r	0	*	isn't it crazy that is labeled Humane?
t1_dtzlpil	1	*	Absolutely true and unfortunate. Hopefully we can start growing meat soon. It will be weird at first though.
t1_dtzigtw	1	*	Difficult to do that though when you probably disagree with the consumption of meat. I mean it might be slightly nicer on the animals but ultimately it's just a slightly posher slaughterhouse 
t1_dtzle8q	1	*	Believing that the only possible reason someone might disagree with you is that they're emotional hypocrites is not a healthy way to go about life.
t1_du00p8q	1	*	Thanks. That's an excellent idea.
t1_dtzjjnk	1	*	They are scavengers. 
t1_dtzp6af	0	*	If you want grilled pork, raise a pig and slaughter it.
t1_dtzq67y	1	*	Right. At this point in society, we have no actual need for meat. It is just something people enjoy, and indulge in daily. 
t1_dtzyysy	0	*	You can like both but to put them on the same moral plane is dishonest. One always involves pain and suffering, the other is just a plant. 
t1_dtziso7	0	*	i mean im vegan and all, but context matters. im not super bummed about killing a mosquito that is trying to bite me  
t1_dtzt9ia	1	*	People will kill for $20. If there ever were a massive generational switch away form eating meat in a short period of time it would be insane amounts of money.
t1_du0flhc	1	*	Those are points I didnt even think of! Thank you! 
t1_du1ccyw	1	*	Nope
t1_dtzm1ir	1	*	Not mine 
t1_dtzhfrw	1	*	They do.   It's good to do a good investigation about what a label really implies. There's also good things out there.

t1_dtzw8yh	0	*	Why can't I care about all those things?  I am totally glad to support ethical alternatives in any of the areas you mentioned.  So why aren't you open to not killing and eating animals?
t1_dtzs5wl	0	*	Thank you! :)

t1_du04hf0	0	*	and the strange part is that meat in itself doesn't taste good. We have to season them and roast in different ways to achieve that
t1_dtzilwl	0	*	So?
t1_dtzq4n2	1	*	Subbed.
t1_du0hp4y	1	*	Been vegetarian for years but never heard it put quite like this. Nice analogy 
t1_dtzk99d	1	*	Well, anything that has anarcho in the name is poorly conceived rubbish yes I agree. 
t1_du00jts	1	*	best reply I've ever heard is Donald Trump says he wants to run the country like one of his businesses.  God help us.
t1_dtzgj6a	1	*	Plus when they escape it doesn't take long for them to go feral and grow big tusks.
t1_dtzwvvk	0	*	Lol.  The south of France, Portugal, and a few other countries also practise bullfighting.   And no, I do not agree with you. 
t1_dtzu3sk	0	*	These laws only exist in a few states. Most states aren't that shitty about this.
t1_dtzhpvy	1	*	I think most people don't see a moral issue with killing animals as long as you don't cause them undue suffering. 
t1_dtzdqnz	0	*	I am vegetarian for 17 years and i still favor Lab Meat as the final solution, one that would turn even me back to meat again. Cause there is just no downside

t1_dtzo0if	1	*	I don't think he actually read the article.
t1_dtzm0x7	0	*	Aww. I was gonna make the best swine flu joke ever conceived by man.
t1_dtzqfbn	1	*	Do you think that GMO's are bad for your health? Or the environment? Or why does organic food matter to you? 
t1_du09qfb	1	*	That might be true per/chicken. But we eat a LOT of chicken.  If we switch all the red meat to chicken I'm not sure that would work out better. 
t1_du6f8in	1	*	Ah theres the straw man argument again with voting. 
t1_dtzt2ls	1	*	Some people just don't fucking care. They have no empathy for animals. And I suspect a lot of that comes from religious beliefs wherein humans are the only things with souls, etc.
t1_dtztzw7	1	*	This is the only logical explanation for having laws like this. They know that us Americans will be put off  from buying when we find out how our food is made.  
t1_du0g1j7	1	*	But you're the hypocrite if you kill a fly.
t1_dtzmrcn	1	*	I'd argue that supporting charities and giving money to people that are proactively helping is better than passively not partaking. You can also do both obviously.
t1_dtzkmf0	0	*	I agree.   The main problem with meat eaters is the disconnection.   Most eaters of dead animal flesh would not eat meat if they had to deal with the bloody mess, not to mention all the shit.  
t1_dtzhp9z	0	*	Bullfighting has been banned in the Canary Islands and Catalonia, plus its becoming less profitable every year. Far from ideal but we are making steps, not all of Spain is the same.
t1_du01dal	0	*	Sure.  I don't eat any meet from that company.  I don't give a crap what they do.  It isn't even in my home country.

t1_dtznv66	0	*	Exactly, the UK does this, you can't have much hope
t1_dtzt4tt	1	*	Yep I've tried going veg for a while, the only thing I got from it were cravings for meat. 
t1_dtzvr68	0	*	yes, and even tho I despise capitalism as well, it does bring science, technology and medicine onward, because you know, greed -> improvement in technology because -> more money 
t1_dtzwub3	1	*	It depends what you eat with both. If you're stocking up on fake meats and cheeses that's pricey. If you're eating beans, grains with seasonal/frozen fruits and veggies it's cheap AF.
t1_dtziud4	0	*	Are you sure it's just straight up illegal? I thought it was just illegal without the owner's permission.
t1_dtzguzo	1	*	Most large animals are dangerous if you don't treat them well or they suspect you're going to kill them.
t1_dtzl4sb	0	*	For real? Is that actually being ground into ground meat? What about ground beef, because I do eat quite a bit of that..? 
t1_dtzw43t	1	*	It doesnt make a difference how much pus the pig is made of as long as i get the sweet sweet bacon part. Have you ever tasted bacon? Pus free bacon with no poo on it? Delish!
t1_dtzmpy2	0	*	Yes of course, I don't base morals of empathy, that would be very dumb
t1_dtzse91	1	*	Welcome to America.  Where cash is king and the constitution doesn't matter.
t1_du3w8wf	1	*	How is it not true?

t1_dtzlhxl	1	*	Businesses run the country, make the laws, don't want to allow anything that might change that. 
t1_dtziak6	1	*	So what is the point of your comment then? Just normal edgy teen stuff then I guess?
t1_du0sx5r	0	*	But in the first situation, the dog gets to stay alive and see you again. The idea is that you shouldn't do either.
t1_dtzic1t	0	*	There is absolutely zero cell signal in the grocery stores in my area.. but they'll let you use their free wifi.. hmm.
t1_dtzyoqk	1	*	Yes, that's precisely where I disagree. It's a question of which ethics you subscribe to.
t1_dtzyll9	1	*	You made me hungry :(
t1_dtzo3kf	1	*	That's why you fully cook them. It gets rid of the disease.
t1_dtzgnml	0	*	\> bullfighting and bull running are national pastimes.  It's not. Not even old people generally like that. Stop the lies

t1_dt3yhz4	1	*	Anything to fuel their racism
t1_dt49h0o	0	*	Yes, but do those papers not count if the journal they are published in has an insufficient impact factor?  Or is the student judged on the inherent merit work they have done.
t1_dt477kp	1	*	I generally agree with your comment, don't see equivalency between GOP and Dems.

t1_dt5pjxf	1	*	How many Chinese grad students vs ones from Netherlands? 
t1_dt3xs19	0	*	That would be applicable to 90% if no more of the whole scientific community, not especially Chinese researchers.
t1_dt54siw	0	*	No, ROC lost support of 400 million Chinese and PRC won the civil war. It's the legitimate successor of China now.
t1_dt4pd6u	1	*	I certainly agree that it's not great. I figure that it is at least an improvement upon simply looking plain output of papers.
t1_dt597jq	1	*	Yes, Im site you know better.
t1_dt3sevm	0	*	Population would certainly be a factor.  The GOP is certainly not encouraging scientific research in the US.  Remember Trump thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax.

t1_dsgusi2	1	*	Or just take their own bags with them. Seriously, whatever happened to having your own shopping bag?
t1_dsgpdt3	0	*	Set it high enough and we can simultaineously reclassify everyone who is unemployed as freelance recyclers. Win-win!
t1_dshcjfy	1	*	No kidding?? I did not know that. Well, that certainly explains a lot!
t1_dshimxm	1	*	We did, it's just collected from forgetting to grab a bag, or going to asda unexpectedly. They added up.
t1_dsh1dlg	1	*	Our economic need for wood and paper products has been a driving force behind forestry and environmental sciences. 
t1_dv3e28k	1	*	Well said. I entirely agree.
t1_dtay73i	1	*	Well that makes it even more unbelievable.  Do you really think you could divorce Putin himself and live?
t1_dtbcziz	1	*	Lmao so accurate. Why don't people understand that sometimes you have to watch the whole thing to understand what's going on and we know as much as you do???
t1_dtcqyun	0	*	>journalists routinely disappear in Russia names? 
t1_dtbjk6c	1	*	Upvote for that!
t1_dtb5x3s	1	*	Untold celebrities dont pretend they dont have kids, though.
t1_dtax19g	0	*	What are you talking about?
t1_dtaxl8v	1	*	I think youre onto something
t1_dtawsg1	1	*	This rings true.  Soooooo true. 
t1_dtb3en2	1	*	At least in that I agree with him. It's so unethical to have people following others and taking pictures without their consent. So yeah, it should be definitely off-limits. 
t1_dtavheq	1	*	Nope. Putin made him take out that big ass loan that he can no longer pay back in order to pay Putin his half of the cut *AFTER* Putin's daughter had already taken half of the original total. 
t1_dtb4k9k	1	*	Was about to ask the same thing, lol
t1_dtax4d8	1	*	Bad? 
t1_dtax4d0	1	*	Well if it was being held by someone else wouldnt they be the one doing the touching? U0001f914
t1_dtb5684	1	*	Or umbrella ricin
t1_dtb1n3b	1	*	That's his fault for letting her run him like that. Bitch. 
t1_dtb6afe	1	*	Do they tho? Feels like a thing people say without actual proof just cause someone said so and so...  honestly asking.  
t1_dtbbzfn	0	*	in the US journalist dont disappear? lol
t1_dtb5l6v	1	*	Why are Kylo Ren and Vladamir Putin dancing together?

t1_dtaxkge	1	*	No potato. Such is life
t1_dtb6wru	1	*	How can your daddy be so rich he buys you an acrobatic rock and roll stadium but you still can't buy the good dance pantyhose
t1_dtb6dba	1	*	Upvote for boolets
t1_dtb1cch	1	*	They are slowly digesting Western culture from the beginning of the Cold War and on. You should have seen what they were doing in the 90s.
t1_dtb1yuj	1	*	Especially chrysanthemum tea.
t1_dtb03wc	1	*	Stop, stop, Donald can only get so h... oh, wait, he can't.

t1_dtb1pvp	1	*	Long live President Putin 
t1_dtave68	0	*	.. what? Where did you get that from?
t1_dtawmgc	1	*	I'd consider myself lucky for not shooting myself twice in the back, then hitting myself with metal bars and finally throwing myself of a bridge.
t1_dtb6uj0	0	*	There was also a major Russian newspaper that released a report claiming the same girl was Putins daughter. That newspaper closed down due to financial troubles THAT VERY SAME DAY
t1_dtbef2e	1	*	It was a public secret that one of them lived in Leiden, The Netherlands.
t1_dtayvo8	1	*	Yet everyone assumed it was all his money even KNOWING he was married to Putins daughter we

t1_dsg4jo9	0	*	Your guess? Anything to justify IDF terrorism, eh?
t1_dsv4lqj	1	*	Real talk
t1_dsv82y4	1	*	Even before that, a lot of huge companies would fudge their numbers and get millions in REFUNDS despite being hugely profitable (not on the submitted paper of course).
t1_dsv2iuf	0	*	Project, deflect, redirect.
t1_dsvj2w4	0	*	Shoney's it is
t1_dtmsr27	1	*	Boo hoo plantation owners and pro-Batista reactionaries were chased away. THEY WERE THE REAL VICTIMS, THE WORKERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL TO BE TREATED LIKE SHIT!!!!!!!!!!
t1_dtn75es	1	*	There is no reasoning with a person that messed up in the head.
t1_dt5sb43	1	*	What was wrong with it? I haven't read it but I'm curious.
t1_ds6pa0l	1	*	no i didn't but what ever it takes to get people to buy in I'm all for it
t1_dtycygs	0	*	I figured the articles about him spewing nonsense were big enough that an /s wasnt necessary. Guess not
t1_du1ofz2	0	*	remember when these jokes were funny ?  me neither. 
t1_dtwmjwv	1	*	One of many, yes.  VOA is yo America, what RT is to Russia, and CCTV is to China.
t1_dtwkify	0	*	DEW IT  
t1_dtw4hnz	1	*	No, Hillary Duff.
t1_dtwix1h	0	*	Germany, Russia, and the United States all had issues with hate and were relatively pretty educated.

t1_dtjpsox	1	*	You're not just conservative, you're primitive.
t1_dtjbpxa	1	*	English will be in the back of the instruction booklet.....
t1_dtjrkna	1	*	Shame.  Dems would at least *attempt* to address the issue, even if it failed.  Both parties really aren't the same.
t1_dtje5pc	1	*	God damn this is a stupid comment.
t1_dv2wor8	0	*	Those responsible should really do something about it. So what are the Polish government going to do?
t1_dv5v98a	1	*	Eu subsidies maybe stands for 1% of the polish bnp growth.(most of wich goes back to germany ) And poland had higher growth before it entered the EU . This wouldn't fit you agenda tho would it?
t1_duucjon	1	*	Are there any actual figures? I ask because of how the media over-estimates the impact Twitter bullshit has here.
t1_duufkro	1	*	Munich Agreement, no?
t1_dt83omj	1	*	Too real
t1_dt86poe	0	*	If that is the case, and it obviously is, then why is this announcement that big of a deal? There are still 4 French coal plants that I would imagine employ a good number of workers. 
t1_dt8xc3u	0	*	Not sure, but i looked up beyond 2000 and that wasn't it. Some science show from the late 90s
t1_dt8w3oo	1	*	Yeah, the smartphone is pretty mindblowing with all the things that it can do, and all the older techs that it replaces.
t1_dt7y3bn	1	*	Care to provide sources? Judging by your post history, I would say you have none. Just another talking point.
t1_dt8cghy	0	*	New nuclear (fusion) is more expensive because it is still experimental. Solar and wind break down and are extremely expensive. You need little uranium to produce a ton of power
t1_dt8kwqr	0	*	Lol.  Guess i have to waste a reply on this stupid liberal again.  Put that in your context pipe and smoke it.
t1_dt83jd8	1	*	>Did you know that coal power spreads more radiation trough coal ash than nuclear power does?  That's only true for normal operation, not the case when the cancer epidemic causing shit hits the fan.
t1_dt8gqdl	1	*	How is it deserving of criticism that they've been doing the right thing for over 50 years and are making a public step in continuing to do the right thing?
t1_dt7wund	0	*	/s is unnecessary, and it totally destroys the joke.
t1_dt7zuk8	1	*	Same motherfucker. 
t1_dt84e9u	1	*	I think you could even make an argument that if Germany were to build and run safe nuclear plants, there would be a knock-on effect of improving nuclear safety globally.
t1_dt8f52a	0	*	Got to replace them. Takes time and money. Permitting process alone, even for wind or solar, might push past his boastful deadline.
t1_dt85nga	1	*	> Battery-supported solar   I didn't know we had such good batteries... Are they lithium based ?
t1_dt7ua8f	1	*	Corrected.
t1_dt830wq	1	*	100m high towers are expensive.  (Yes, even in Dubai :) )
t1_dt805j8	1	*	Nobody feels good about coal. But plenty of people aren't optimistic enough to put their faith into incident free nuclear power in the face of a track record that shows we're incapable of such.
t1_dt98zo8	1	*	Doh!
t1_dt8srg9	0	*	I dont know man. Whenever I woke up to bright sunlight (kid during 80s) I thought the Bomb had fallen. It got better in the 90s though.
t1_dt841mt	1	*	Introducing windmills with solar panels on the wings!
t1_dt8s40y	1	*	I hope you realise he's talking about the effects of Chernobyl, not some radiation that comes out of every nuclwar power plant.
t1_dt8547i	0	*	Even after the gigafactory there is not enough battery production on Earth to make solar viable all the time for power generation
t1_dt80wj8	1	*	Seriously what kind of bullshit are people spreading on here. Next they will say wind turbines dont kill birds and works havent died on them in brutal ways 
t1_dt84pxy	1	*	Wow, That's a pretty sad outlook
t1_dt905e7	1	*	So you're saying [this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-nuclearpower/france-to-decide-by-end-2018-how-many-nuclear-plants-to-shut-minister-idUSKBN1CX0KP) article no longer applies?
t1_dt901yn	1	*	The CANDU reactor can burn thorium, though it generally uses unenriched uranium, and it's pretty damned old. The first one was brought online 56 years ago
t1_dt8p4ff	1	*	hahaha he can disagree all he wants. Nuclear will never go below 50% here... not before 2050 at least...
t1_dt8q756	1	*	We've been going towards this goal for 60 years. It WAS major electricity generation. We are just saying that we are almost finished getting rid of coal. 
t1_dt7z5u8	0	*	Dust will still cling to that.
t1_dt8ci5m	0	*	Solar and wind are good too. Im not saying we shouldnt invest in them
t1_dt7yai0	1	*	Scotland also announced in 2008 not to build any nuclear power plants and focused only on renewables.
t1_dt83xbu	1	*	That I can definitely agree on, should not have been there in the first place.
t1_dt7z4f4	1	*	Living in Cairo right now, I would say dust is definitely an issue. Even if you close your window and put tapes on the frame, somehow there are still dust accumulation by the window.
t1_dt80myr	1	*	It's almost like buying diet Jell-o instead of regular Jell-o. If you check out the calories the difference is minimal, It's not exactly lying but it's a abuse in the wording
t1_dtatlnb	0	*	This is good for bitcoin is pretty much a meme now.
t1_dtbfrrj	1	*	I know enough about cyptocurrencies to know something so volatile isnt something to invest in.  If you want voilitility why not just trade in your USD (a real currency) into Zimbabwe dollars. 
t1_dtbbl85	1	*	Pretty sure taking someones assets are illegal. It does have legal protection and it is illegal to steal. You don't know what you're talking about.
t1_dspz7hz	0	*	What if it was a thick wire and went into say a large body of water?  Not trying to be argumentative, just wondering how it works.
t1_dspjic5	0	*	No offence taken mate! 
t1_dtdor3u	0	*	The greater good. 
t1_dtdstel	0	*	Not the same thing. This is redistribution of property via the state. 
t1_dunv5jb	1	*	Aside from the 6 fingers and webbed toes?
t1_ds1kd4y	0	*	Jesus you are dense, can you read between the lines at all? Or are you just a tool shed? 
t1_du6u8h5	1	*	I know. We both understood each other though;)
t1_dt0rtkb	1	*	Cold'ish weather still kills off most insects. Isn't that the whole point of winter..? ;)
t1_dsyziev	0	*	Israel didn't start the 1973 war.
t1_dszihfw	1	*	Sry for not clearing much, my friend. 
t1_dszd9oj	1	*	No, there's genuinely a shortage of nurses in the US. Probably doctors, too.
t1_dszzxiq	1	*	True 
t1_dsz0j7r	0	*	 The same can be said of America.
t1_dszeh1r	1	*	Do you know what the E in EMTALA stands for? It's emergency. Hospitals are required to stabilize you only. You cannot walk into the ER and get a hip replacement or chemotherapy.
t1_dsz1lwp	0	*	Or gay, or atheist.
t1_dt0fzt8	1	*	I honestly doubt it is more spread out than the US. 
t1_dsyyz6a	1	*	I agree
t1_dszc2ji	0	*	No they aren't. 
t1_dsz6cic	0	*	Clearly your economics teacher should have been paid less
t1_dsyy5w5	0	*	I dont understand what you want to say with that 
t1_dsyy3tc	1	*	We're a big country that has a lot of debt 
t1_dsz8y4o	1	*	Still a shithole though. 
t1_dsyx02g	1	*	100%, just walk into a hospital. 
t1_dszonky	0	*	What part of 'not my fucking problem' did you not understand?  Plus I have insurance because I'm not a fucking idiot. 
t1_dsz2ve0	0	*	Must have meant that for someone else! Whoops
t1_dsyviwa	1	*	There's a big divide between Egypt and sub-saharan African where the disease situation is much worse. That being said they're not immune to disease or anything and this is good news from them.
t1_dszav58	0	*	That distinction is odd.
t1_dsz9yp4	0	*	What did I say that has anything to do with EMTALA?
t1_dsz0wfy	1	*	Inner voice: don't say shithole... don't say shithole... don't say shithole
t1_dsz8n34	0	*	That's pretty decent pay for middle-high school education. You gross probably what 45-50k a year? 
t1_dszb6wo	0	*	Is it popular with the student base?
t1_dsz9pqq	1	*	50-60 hour workweeks aren't uncommon in a lot of professions, but I'm doubting most teachers regularly work 60 hours/wk unless you happen to have a source?
t1_dszjilj	1	*	I was joking, apparently it was not as obvious as I thought it would be, which is a bit worrying actually 
t1_dsz4nnd	0	*	So I have to pay for it twice? NAH
t1_dsyyimp	0	*	So? Where's your point? Where saying the country as a whole, not the top 1%. And that's for every country, it's not specific to the US.
t1_dsz29wv	1	*	Exactly.
t1_dszhmo8	1	*	Unless you're a damn good lawyer and have connections to a law firm already. 
t1_dszbolh	1	*	>**Ya fuck me** for talking about American issues on an American-based social media platform  That's an odd turn on.
t1_dsyx2e1	1	*	You might just get shipped to some former eastern bloc nation.
t1_dsz0brl	1	*	I live in rural Mississippi. It's not amazing here, but we're not equivalent to a fucking third world country.   Have *you* ever driven through these places?
t1_dsz0gh1	1	*	Debt is relevant when you're sick though, and can help kill you.
t1_dsz7ij8	1	*	And as you pay more and more you get better and better candidates.
t1_dszfnaq	1	*	That *is* what teachers do during the summer. It is *not* time off.
t1_dsz2dqr	1	*	Rugged individualism is what made America an amazing country to begin with. It's such a shame that we're moving backward towards such a collectivist attitude. 
t1_dszpspd	1	*	It's all good. You aren't wrong about it getting harder to tell sometimes.
t1_dsz3tlz	0	*	Maintain our standard of living? Tell me what military power poses a risk to the US.
t1_dsyz4ru	0	*	^ is marketer?
t1_dszebf4	0	*	Im surprised she had to wait that long. What insurance do you have? 
t1_dt0u41b	1	*	you think profit is the only negative influencer on workers?
t1_dsyypia	1	*	Yes, Canada rank lower than compared to most of Europe. But higher than Australia. 
t1_dszemk4	1	*	Cool.
t1_duguh8n	0	*	Maybe I'm a lil naive but each time I see the Russians they just mean the Kremlin, not the whole population. The OP might have a point, Russia is shown to have a hand in racial tensions online. 
t1_du8c1oi	0	*	Well look I disagree with that.  I think when it comes to minors they are to easy led. Ive my own opinion on it and you have yours so lets leave it at that 
t1_du8dvl2	1	*	I see what you did there ( xb0( xb0 ( xb0  xb0) xb0) xb0)
t1_dupt8uh	1	*	How cold is it right now in Moscow?
t1_duq7xtw	0	*	Not only Eastern Europe. I have a feeling that Georgia, Armenia and the like would have fared better off without them.   And they also stole a part of Finland and Japan. 
t1_dupx7t0	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_duq3lsf	0	*	The Russian government conducted a thorough, well-funded, well-coordinated doping scheme at the Sochi Olympics. They simply cannot be trusted.
t1_dupznoc	0	*	Especially now that they allow females...
t1_duqjz3s	1	*	I mean when its systemic to the point of doctors and officials being in on it, yes. 
t1_duqigh1	1	*	Hey! I get this reference!
t1_dtqr01m	1	*	At this point, I don't think there's much difference between CCP and the Chinese government. China is a one-party dictatorship, after all.
t1_dtqohun	0	*	Since when was Tibet ever a commonly recognized sovereign nation?
t1_dtqhloy	1	*	Derkajerbs
t1_dtqo9yf	0	*	Tibet is unquestionably a part of China that China bought from the British after they conquered it.  Tibetan secessionist radicals demanding differently won't change that fact.

t1_dst3hvx	1	*	I knew I forgot something.
t1_dsri62g	1	*	technically, yes, but countries like Denmark have essentially permanant deferment on the issue. Like, Denmark has been in the process of joining for close to 20 years now.
t1_dsr75mf	1	*	No. They could end it at any point before invoking article 50; now they have said they want out, if they want to go back on that, they still need to accept a good pounding.
t1_dsr0ile	0	*	I get your point.  It just bothers me that the vote shows the will of the people and a bunch of yahoos would just ignore what was voted on
t1_dsrd9ic	1	*	That's news to me. I heard they were talking about it and it might only be for people who'd lived here for more than 5 years
t1_dsrhcxj	0	*	Err most forecasts show we will still grow outside the EU...people really don't understand the economics of leaving. 
t1_dsr5hef	0	*	The ruling party in the UK will be decimated. These fuckers have to choose between fucking themselves or fucking the country. 
t1_dsrvs74	0	*	More relevant than saying it is 99% of the British public's fault.
t1_dsrsbrl	1	*	Of course, we had even less of a democratic mandate for the Lisbon Treaty.
t1_dsrop4j	1	*	About as stupid as wanting to leave it. So why do we have Brexit? Because people don't give two fuck about economy. Like I said, i'd rather have UK out so we don't have them half-in. 
t1_dssa5eb	1	*	Ah, watching Boris Johnson explain that was hilarious in a depressing way..
t1_dsr8js9	0	*	And what happens when you inevitably get 10 referendums with 47-53, 51-49, 55-45, 43-57, etc. etc.? Do you keep repeating it ad aeternum?
t1_dsrk8ai	1	*	What are you talking about? Fix what?
t1_dudmyz8	0	*	Not a bad thing, if it means less violence and blood. Sometimes you have to pick the lesser evil
t1_duecuhy	1	*	Well, that's pretty well divorced from reality.  Stick to the RTS games.
t1_ds3tjl1	1	*	I had to google that and [it did not disappoint.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8XNrAjh7eo)
t1_dumdh36	1	*	Watch the video. They're not dealing with stress by laughing they're just outside fucking laughing.  This isn't the school where the shooting happened these kids just want a free day out of class.

t1_dtsovmj	1	*	Cancer, leukemia, Alzheimer's...
t1_dtt8i7o	0	*	Slick dodge babe. Missed the point but w/e. Education isn't 50% of Americas strongsuit. Maybe when you vote for Kanye in the next election he can get rid of the blacks.
t1_dts5cwk	0	*	So, like every country the US has poor people. 
t1_dts7lbd	0	*	Yep, looks like it has gone up ~5% since the last time I saw it.
t1_dtry025	0	*	Naw, I knew you weren't, my man, no hard feelings; no reason you'd be framing the fact that the rich outlive the poor as a good thing if you were in favor of helping the poor.

t1_dtt31v4	1	*	Ouch I thought the US cornered that market.
t1_dtt4rt8	1	*	Porque no los tres? 
t1_dtrtajp	1	*	More people = need for more doctors/staff   Lower wages compared to other countries/careers = less doctors/staff  
t1_dtt2co8	1	*	Trump is a fucking moron who should really stay out of British politics. Every time he pokes his nose in he demonstrates how little he actually knows about what is going on.  
t1_duakqnm	1	*	Yeah but that's inverse prisoner's dilemma. Everyone who stays quiet and presents a unified front can discredit the whistleblower and further entrench themselves in power.

t1_dtd5xde	0	*	So your saying hypothetically that Trump was (and maybe still is) friends with transphobic people? He also didn't distance himself from David Duke and the KKK. Our president keeps good company.
t1_dshssq7	1	*	Yes. 
t1_dsidj6x	0	*	Hahahaha! Best joke in this thread!  Amazon delivering anything FREE to Norway... Sweet summer child... 
t1_dsibd6s	1	*	The 57 states, and two more tomorrow thing didn't get much play after the campaign.  My Muslim faith, though, still gets talked about. Because of the implication.
t1_dsi6ksm	0	*	It's notable because nearly everytime he speaks there is a slip up.  Dude wouldn't have even won the election if everyone followed his guidance and voted on the 28th.
t1_dsicl7u	1	*	More like worried about Putin, who's been doing aggressive posturing towards Europe and Scandinavia.
t1_dsibkdk	1	*	Right wing media generally doesnt even bother with sources. Remember when Obama was winning the shadow government from a bunker in DC? 
t1_dsimg5q	1	*	But itll ensure all those Danes and Swedes will be very dead.

t1_dsicd0q	1	*	You don't know about all the secret states?
t1_dsip730	1	*	Like I said, you have to want to post there. It weeds out a lot of brigading and agenda driven posters.
t1_dsi5z2r	0	*	I would argue the same for non-trump supporters. Minus the gold-shitting part. Either way, I'm mostly just sick of all the trump talk on reddit.

t1_dsink66	0	*	It is the tactic to use when you don't have a defense for the current President. Deflect and make sure your argument focuses on something out of context.  
t1_dsit5io	0	*	TBF, has it ever been tested?
t1_du1z6d7	1	*	Yup.  Banks fucking over the entire nation? Nothin.  Chong's kid sells a bong in Pennsatucky?  Avada Kedavra!

t1_dsywbt3	1	*	Bye
t1_dszkz2b	1	*	Well, considering most women have long hair, I think they just slapped a common hairstyle on her and were lucky. That would probably be a bit harder to do with a guy.
t1_dsyw9p0	1	*	No he shouldn't. What's wrong with you people??
t1_dt952m7	0	*	1. Stephen Curry says he doesn't want to go to the White House.  2. Trump suddenly removes the invitation to Stephen Curry.

t1_dt8xk10	1	*	Why would you want to wish a small defenseless animal to be held under the care of this narcissistic tool? Poor thing would probably die of hunger. He'd probably blame the dog for being brown. 
t1_dt90uif	1	*	Only if that person is a tory though, tweet all the hate you want at anyone else, and they'll probably pay you for it. 
t1_dt8v20e	1	*	May may protest protest law law, or May may trump Trump. It might sound hard to believe, but it's Trudeau.

t1_dt9s0l6	1	*	Didn't D.C have riots when he was elected?
t1_dt92ove	1	*	The police shouldn't have to fight citizens.  Bring out the politicians to disperse the riots.  They can at least have vests and a helmet.
t1_dt8wzfk	1	*	To be honest I'd be *more* likely to protest if they told me I couldn't. Not sure if that's just me being a contrary Mary though!
t1_dt8z6lw	0	*	Everything about that coup screamed fake. It was a power grab. As far as Smeagol was concerned, those civilians were collateral.  And now the piece of shit is genociding Kurds. 
t1_dt94n2k	1	*	For what's it's worth, I respect you for saying that. It's one of those topics a lot of people would double down defending their choice. 
t1_dt8x87g	1	*	Start bringing pikes to protests.  
t1_dt8tyd4	0	*	That is not the way it is defined in the laws of most countries. It usually has a very specific meaning.

t1_dt8st00	0	*	I'm pretty skeptical he would be executing political rivals. He talks a big game but he doesn't seem like the type to come close to that.

t1_dt9g83j	0	*	And the American people pay for it.
t1_dt9gdla	1	*	And yet he's still more American than Trump. Country of origin doesn't enter into it. Americanness is about loving freedom and equality.

t1_dt90bmp	1	*	Sheesh. Behead ONE King and you a reputation for life.

t1_dt90lnl	1	*	i wonder how many Americans there would be if no religious fanatics moved there
t1_dt9qjbs	1	*	We need to be careful about who has access to the white house. They might get the presidents ear and get us some stupid policy.

t1_dtgf2zc	1	*	This sounds like a prophecy from Yoda, it does. 
t1_dt9m6de	1	*	You don't earn respect from me because an idiot - multiple idiots in this case - happened to give you a job. He gives no respect to anyone, he gets none either. That is why he is an worldwide joke.
t1_dt8ty8a	1	*	At least we know how to queue. 
t1_dt90y2j	0	*	Sorry, but being an opinion piece doesn't change anything for me... it clearly shows the corporations views... otherwise they wouldn't pay that person to write that opinion piece.

t1_dtwz5v7	1	*	Yea but who cares, if she's not for Trump, she's not a patriot and needs to be deported   /s

t1_dtwu5sh	0	*	A lot of our news media is owned by foreign nationals as it is.
t1_dtx3ucs	1	*	you mean danish. it's small, cold, cozy, does a lot of things right, and is largely overlooked despite its neighbours getting attention
t1_dtx1k75	0	*	But we know Saddam is building weapons of mass destruction and that he is hiding them. 
t1_dtx4qci	0	*	They are doing all that and they won the election lol 
t1_dtwwg62	1	*	yeah I'm from Minnesota, give me all the praise. Just me though, not the state.
t1_dtx1o8m	1	*	What about the Swedes there Ole?
t1_dtwy77b	1	*	Not only, they make it easy to vote early too. I voted absentee when I was at college though, it was easier than I expected.
t1_dtx8wk2	1	*	you should go to funnyjunk.com and say this. You will quickly see the effects of the modern day echo chamber.
t1_dtxfybs	1	*	The other parts are confirmable though, I can't find anything on the black vote

t1_dul3jwz	0	*	Sorry dont fallow dictators that closely
t1_duprb73	1	*	Yeah, and that's why the US is falling into chaos and Germany is the leader of europe.
t1_duom8d1	0	*	Not saying I don't believe you, but can you name anyone who was accused of Volksverhetzung for criticism? 
t1_duu3rql	1	*	The world is already mostly insane. Who knows.

t1_ducpamx	0	*	Your FB timeline being full of garbage and shitposts is a reflection of your friends and family. Not of Facebook. I don't get how people don't see that. 
t1_ducxkt0	1	*	I read both of those and just think Shut up, you're both morons. We do need to change some things though.  Unfortunately most people don't think that way

t1_ducvgec	0	*	Your presence is as entertaining as a fire in an orphanage.
t1_ducktxj	0	*	Skepticism was bred into our survival as a species. I'm not certain how much more evident life can make that. The claim we are not wired for skepticism seems to be a false claim.

t1_ductr7e	1	*	/r/bestof is pretty bad lately too. 
t1_ducqpmi	1	*	It seems like instead of gain enemy intel the current tactic is flood the population with fake news so its hard to tell whats real and what isnt. So disinformation could be considered a weapon. 
t1_duco5q8	1	*	Haha you just got bodied. Try being nicer next time.
t1_ducph77	1	*	Hostile
t1_dud123l	0	*	That'll work too. A fun project for President's Day weekend.

t1_dud9wtg	0	*	I think I would.  And I am a woman. 
t1_ds20mkh	0	*	Again, we're talking about military courts and military prisons here. She's being treated like a soldier. Tell me, how many countries did you know where minor citizens are brought to military courts?
t1_dt0mvce	1	*	We did stuff like during Desert Storm and again during OIF.  I personally saw the long term effects of that during my deployments to Iraq, and it isn't pretty.
t1_dt0jxns	1	*	Lol, you mean the terrorists they're funding? 
t1_dt0px0x	0	*	And apparently opium

t1_dt0h59v	0	*	Yes.
t1_dt15uyb	1	*	Yeah but domestically built guns aren't subject to import restrictions. In fact, the US requires that all military weapons be manufactured stateside, likely for this exact type of scenario.
t1_dt0l46q	1	*	Thats what you get for being in bed with Iran. Do you want food and water? Kick the Hezbollah proxies occupying Sanaa and reinstall the legitimate goverment. If not then enjoy the JDAMs. 
t1_dt0iknz	0	*	Yeah that's the second time that person has used do instead of act... kind of a weird mistake to repeat...
t1_dt0q1r1	0	*	The world would definitely **not** be a better place if the US didn't exist.

t1_dt0ih04	0	*	People keep correcting him and he keeps acting the same mistake. No clue why he's doing like that U0001f914
t1_dt0nlii	0	*	Now kiss
t1_dt0ijkh	0	*	Didnt sell enough weapons past year huh
t1_dt0vjuo	1	*	Just means that nobody was interested in it, not that people loved that Germany sold arms to SA.
t1_dt0p0ng	1	*	No i dont but only because Stalin, Hitler etc said something doesnt mean its wrong.
t1_dt0hnea	1	*	Seems like 18 year old Chelsea scum don't like downvotes!

t1_dssuenw	1	*	Thank you.
t1_dto2x75	1	*	In cases like this, you design a procedure that is accurate and fast enough to achieve the desired result.  And then pay a professional to follow that procedure.
t1_dto2u6s	1	*	Or just say one sentence to a coworker to confirm? They were apparently around him, and it would take like two seconds.
t1_dto1m74	0	*	I guess frequent tornado watches but rare tornado warnings would count.
t1_dubbmce	1	*	Welcome to the land of low salaries.
t1_duacz1g	1	*	One explanation I've seen of the Canadian eh is that it indicates the speaker desires a response to the preceding statement.  Thought that idea was neat.
t1_dsbgvj6	0	*	Yes, how dare they be biased towards reason and facts? Fuck them atheists!
t1_dsa83tq	0	*	Yeah the only reason I think them hiding kiddie fuckers is a bad thing is because I'm an atheist.
t1_duq36eg	1	*	So if you have an oxygen-depleted dead zone already, would that be a tolerable place to start an artificial algae bloom?

t1_dtipazv	1	*	Whataboutism.
t1_dtj852i	1	*	Well, he missed a few steps there.  Also, usually you would put a bore light in, which requires the action to be held open.
t1_dtiydpg	0	*	...darn weapon took out three of our best guys before we could finally confirm it was empty...
t1_dtigqya	0	*	That might just be true. Never heard of the top brass taking the time to clean their own weapons, as it was always the batman/runner who did it. 
t1_duz2rgj	1	*	Basically, you put in new soil.
t1_duy8k39	1	*	> Since when was there mass scale confiscation of any kind?  what do you think the native in native american means?

t1_duy77ea	0	*	>Do you think were stupid or what?  Yes

t1_duraisp	0	*	Joke's on you, the police know who I am
t1_dur8wm5	1	*	I'm just clarifying your own words for you so you can see the logical fallacy, but you failed to see it.
t1_dur32la	1	*	Even worse
t1_dus1aqv	1	*	Well it's not a campaign, but if it were I would be illegal whether they disclosed it or not. That's why people launder their money through charitable foundations and SuperPACs.
t1_durucb0	1	*	They weren't notified of the corruption. The FBI covered it up.
t1_dsc5206	1	*	What would you propose they do?
t1_dscvxsr	1	*	I'd never seen that before... thats pretty funny

t1_dsbxkxy	0	*	Blame Caesar for that. By all accounts, that month should be October, but he had to shift it afaik.
t1_dsd7isf	0	*	Nope both are disgusting and should be done at home. I have never seen it in my city and it should be kept that way. Plan ahead with your hungry baby or bring formula.  
t1_dscxye9	1	*	Yeah never understood the problem with this. Must be a New World issue.
t1_dslxlsq	1	*	well generally being a senator and having sexual encounters with the President would be a conflict of interest
t1_dsvsa4u	1	*	The Patriot Act it's clearly good for us if it's called Patriot. Only a terrorist would be against that.

t1_dunavuw	1	*	It does say that they were labeled as used or demo/loaner though, right?
t1_dtcvh6u	1	*	You know, in a weird way it kind of reminds me of those 'safaris' where they have a few animals trapped in a fenced off area for rich wankers to shoot and get a trophy to brag about.
t1_dut4gzz	0	*	I believe alcohol is used by sharpshooters to steady the heartbeat, which can improve accuracy.

t1_dswzh5v	0	*	>Common sense stupid phrase https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqJ_4YhYMhE
t1_dswskxa	1	*	Hmm, maybe, but AFAIK there is no legal precedence so far.  The FBI/DOJ could probably pursue charges, but the courts would have to sort it out.  Always fun being the first test case. /s
t1_dsvguqt	1	*	Do you get your news and history lessons exclusively from conservative radio? 
t1_du7rr39	0	*	> There's pretty obvious reasons why you don't just stick anyone in your army, particularly not foreign nationals.  Dude the French Foreign Legion has 24% french recruits.

t1_du8bthf	1	*	So many options!
t1_du9apbl	0	*	The military arent the only ones to sacrifice their lives for a country.

t1_dt2eqnk	1	*	That's not the American way! We want FREEDOM! Freedom, that is, to shit all over where we live! Woooooohoooooo!
t1_dsmhb3o	0	*	They would place a random stolen bike on his bullet-riddled corpse to justify the execution.
t1_dsms7jr	1	*	Did you read the article? It stated that it was past the limit where they could be criminally charged.   Which is kind of bullshit seeing as he had been complaining the whole time. 
t1_dsma365	0	*	How white are you exactly?

t1_dswyhhd	1	*	Yeah 'being conservative and white' is NOT why people were pissed off at the Moore crew. 
t1_dubajac	0	*	He's trying to bring attention to the more important words in the sentence.
t1_duascer	1	*	That's not proof we invaded Iraq for oil only that we invaded on false pretenses to justify regime change. Claiming we invaded Iraq for oil is blatantly false. 
t1_duc6ob0	1	*	You should read Smedley Butler's War is a racket. Even in WWI oil played an important part.
t1_duag8ap	0	*	Like when your motherland invaded Afghanistan?

t1_dub6he1	0	*	Whataboutism... thank you for giving me a term I have so desperately needed to address deflective arguing.
t1_duc6hwt	1	*	> we are committed to supporting our allies?  Too bad those allies are ISIS and al-Qaida.
t1_dubfp7o	0	*	Just fine. Just saying America is the #1 threat to world peace in the world.
t1_duajzi9	0	*	Pretty sure he's saying they did ignore it, not that they should. It's implied that they should not.

t1_dv5qhyd	1	*	No, farmers are just idiots. Although, buzzards have been known to kill lambs when they're desperate.
t1_dtyetbb	0	*	That which is presented without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.   Quoting the Bible doesn't lay a foundation for a rational argument.

t1_dtpllsx	1	*	Brilliant!

t1_dtppabr	0	*	Are you not familiar with government?
t1_dtoiszo	0	*	No history before a day ago.  While I understand lurkers and having alternative accounts, why would they be mimicking another account's comments.  Looks like a manipulated account to me.
t1_dtoxz3e	0	*	You repeated that claim a few times. How about a source?
t1_ds0woo4	1	*	Could be worse. 
t1_ds1lxbm	1	*	I think it is basic terminology only in the UK
t1_dv37zzf	0	*	because bribes? probably...
t1_dtsdyzy	0	*	You're pretty racist for assuming Brown people meant any race, non-white, in Africa and North America
t1_dtpay8t	0	*	That's quite difficult to understand. Obviously we are biased, but how *don't* you invent the wheel?
t1_dsvi33w	1	*	Yes. Governments usually had to spend money to make America look bad and undermine their reputation, now USA just punches itself repetesly screaming why are you making me do this!MAGA!!
t1_dtrzu4k	0	*	Never mind, its just pocket change really, I got it.

t1_dtbtmb5	1	*	Zionism itself is an ideology that promotes Jews having a home. **nothing more**.  Might consider reading about Mizrahi Jews as well.

t1_duma4l3	1	*	Boko Haram spreading across Nigeria leads to a refugee crisis.  > Sorry to tell you, but the US is already there training Nigeria's troops.  Yeah, but we won't be there for any civil wars.

t1_ds2uztt	0	*	Bin Laden was in Pakistan for years and I do not believe for a second that the Pakistani government was unaware. Which means they were compliant in harboring him, which means they can get fucked
t1_dtr7vn3	0	*	It was political.

t1_dtrqb27	1	*	I mean the desire to institute laws for the systematic extermination of minorities seems to be just as mentally unstable, no?
t1_dtrkt65	1	*	Why does it have to be political rather than the more general 'ideological'?
t1_dtrjd9c	1	*	you're really struggling here lol
t1_dtsexot	1	*	Not really no.  Everyone knows there are *some* racists, but Reddit Liberals^TM assume *all* cops are racist, which is entirely untrue.
t1_dtri6iq	0	*	Anders Bering Breivik is a fucking terrorist. Don't talk shit if you don't know shit.
t1_dtvbk08	1	*	Yeah! And girls shouldn't wear revealing clothes, or they're just asking for it. /s

t1_dsgvhzn	1	*	> Amway is still legal in China.  Had to check that. [quick google search later:] Damn, unbelievable!  
t1_dsl5jtq	0	*	Haitian immigrants aren't as good.

t1_dtsipgo	1	*	Me too. I hate my family. 
t1_ds5a4s0	0	*	If the side with the power/money always wins, why negotiate at all? Hell, why even have the word? Just call it domination. 
t1_dskikg2	1	*	yep, people forget that the F-35s are not just for the US. F-22s however, are understandably exclusive.

t1_dsl326f	0	*	Okay, I googled it. What's your point then? Because I don't see a connection.
t1_dtwqq82	0	*	Well Trump should have said that since it caused such an uproar. I wish I knew if that was his intention but he doesn't communicate very well. Every turn I just think of him as a little kid.

t1_dsjz7kp	1	*	We are stuck in this loop: trump says horrible thing. Mouthpiece goes on CNN and says he didnt mean it that way. Its getting tiresome. 
t1_dskmh4r	0	*	Trump is attempting to block whole populations of people from coming based on their religion.  This is why.

t1_dsk510f	0	*	Yeah, because but both sides! is literally the only defense for Trump's constant embarrassment of the country.  As if anyone on earth would consider Trump more professional.

t1_dsjrzyz	0	*	No because a random t_d person has absolutely 0 credibility while the NYTimes has a ton

t1_dsjx6qk	0	*	America was also built by slaves. Things change. If canada can be difficult as fuck to immigrate to then the US should be the same way
t1_dskc1va	1	*	What?  Pretty sure he said this in a meeting and it  got leaked.  He didn't go on tv and address Zimbabwe or something.

t1_dsk5i76	1	*	It's not about taking in the world's trash.
t1_dsjuzpt	0	*	He says that the countries are shitholes, not the people. The people want to leave because of rampant corruption and gangs. No one blames them; we just believe that this country needs border security.
t1_dsk4vof	0	*	Well, to be fair, even to this day, more than 1000 Norwegians emigrate to the US every year (probably those in tech/finance looking for better opportunities)

t1_dslna3g	1	*	Did you put your hands up and say Whoa whoa I'm British, sorry like it's an apology? Might calm a US cop down a bit faster. Our cops tend to not hate foreigners as much as they hate us. :P

t1_dskkcsq	0	*	Democrats were all about how much of shitholes Mexico and the ME in general were until recent years. Now they're suddenly for human trafficing and sex slavery for some mysterious reason.

t1_dsjthkn	0	*	Legally you could apply for citizenship though. I can get Hungarian citizenship because my great-grandpa was a citizen.
t1_dsk6x6x	1	*	He did. He was pretty well-liked and popular, had energetic and motivating speeches without hinting at murdering or deporting people, and brought out Germany out of post-WWI era.

t1_dsjykiu	0	*	So youre saying the examples I listed arent leftist gonverments?  
t1_dsk2ie3	0	*	It's not moral fortitude, I'm only sensing contempt and elitism, because people with decent moral would try to establish a conversation instead of spurring hate.
t1_dsk26zj	1	*	The mental gymnastics that Jason Miller performs to slobber Trump's dick is actually astounding. Why the fuck do they even invite him on panels? He's a fucking nutter.
t1_dsk05qf	1	*	Are you stupid, or are you a liar?  Much like Trump, it's hard to tell sometimes.  Usually, it's both.
t1_dsk0wsg	1	*	Always trying to take race out of the mix. 
t1_dsk3wfy	1	*	What are we missing?

t1_dsjytpk	1	*	Thanks for continuing proof that cordial discussion and discourse is unacceptable. Took you less than a minute to reply. I spent 5 trying to be respectful and thoughtful to you. 
t1_dsjsfm8	0	*	I don't know, swear words don't scare me and trying to keep them away from children seems like a silly endeavor, but I admit that might not be a popular opinion.
t1_dsju530	1	*	Yeah sure and just everyone can make a salary like that. No. but everyone reaps the benefits of the taxes in Norway. 
t1_dsk1t5h	1	*	Fuckin A right they did brother    Hulkamania in this mother!!!
t1_dsjuw2a	0	*	Read my comment again. Thanks.
t1_dsjva3n	0	*	It's almost like the Norwegian justice system views prisoners as human beings and is focused on rehabilitation and not punishment and retribution.
t1_dsk2ijr	0	*	Nigeria would like to have a word with you 
t1_dskcnht	1	*	That's laughable how that makes you upset though

t1_dsk1xhi	0	*	I remember that the Von Braunns became the Browns.
t1_dsjtmto	1	*	It's not just impolite. In the context of denying immigration, it demonstrates a lack of empathy.
t1_dsjw1kt	1	*	Give me your tired, your poor..
t1_dsjy9tk	1	*	I feel like you're forgetting something that would help your argument way more: two **guilty pleas** relating to lying to the FBI **about Russia.**
t1_dsk3v26	1	*	cool story bro
t1_dsjkfo9	1	*	I didn't say he is. I just said it's a valid argument to say that's the logical structure/implication of what he is saying.
t1_dsjw4uy	1	*	Yes! Forgot about that.
t1_dsk7wqa	1	*	And its soooo lovely that you think a President acting so undignified is acceptable.
t1_dsjwoso	1	*	Strawman arguments deserve no reply.

t1_dsjvy60	0	*	I'm sorry that affects you so often.
t1_dsk3cor	0	*	Thats not it. 
t1_dskvyec	1	*	Well not all the Asians.  Basicly they saw the Japanese ruling over the inferior Asians the same way that Arvans would be ruling over Slavic people.

t1_dsjvzbi	1	*	Welcome to America.
t1_dskfeh1	0	*	When people from NYC and LA call the kinds of backwater places Trump voters are from shitholes (because they are) you guys get beyond pissed.

t1_duydt26	0	*	Such as when the courts ruled that Omar al-Bashir must be arrested.
t1_duydjh9	0	*	Ramaphosa said in his SONA that basically no land grabbing will be allowed. So any person or political party/movement that tries to forcibly take land will be on the wrong side of the law.

t1_dt6lx5b	0	*	That might be true if it was only about one baby, but the ramifications of punishing the group of individuals would be further reaching.

t1_dtfcqf8	1	*	That's my point, they're taking advantage of the situation as they always have to frame America as the bad guys, but for the past year the rest of the world has been falling for it.

t1_ds6w7vr	1	*	Later Chinese dynasties had something like that. Sure the king was no philosopher but his advisers were scholars picked by an exam system. Those dynasties were no stranger to corruption of course.  
t1_dt7bgky	1	*	It's not sponsored by 90% either, you're making it up. The Kremlin and Putin however fully own RT and other medias. In what world would you think Trump and his government control CNN anyways, no.

t1_dsczqn1	1	*	How do you calculate return investment on this type of a project?
t1_duxqst4	1	*	Oh i dont disagree but i think that documenting its DNA is an easy cheap thing to do so that at one point in the future we can recreate the species should they go extinct. 
t1_duw844t	0	*	Do we have a better chance with Mammoths? Since theyre relatively more well preserved?
t1_dty0t5a	1	*	Yea, I do.  But like umm, most of my friends have to go to work so it's less ideal. Except I guess there is no traffic.

t1_dty2xwr	1	*	There's a reason I set every reddit server to Arizona time 11 years ago.  Not sure if they are still that way, but I keep all servers I admin on Arizona time for exactly this reason.
t1_dtxyyrf	1	*	I live in az, if we did daylight time, it wouldn't get dark until like 11 pm here. Screw that!
t1_dty4s9n	1	*	Hey where I live in Alaska the sun rises at 11 am on Dec 21st and sets at 2:30, I wouldn't mind it rising at noon and setting at 3:30 just so we don't have to switch between summer and winter time.
t1_dtxwuis	1	*	Maybe go for a checkup with the doctor?
t1_dty3czp	0	*	Got that here in Canada too, it's called Saskatchewan. 
t1_dtxz9fw	1	*	Arizonan here. It's so fucking nice. Gets confusing talking to friends outside the state though.

t1_dtxzx8s	0	*	Pretty much every single person I know. 
t1_dtyi3fz	1	*	I'd classify this as not-so-subtle mockery
t1_dtxyttw	1	*	I too dumb for complete sentences 
t1_dtxz06e	1	*	Technically yes. It's silly though, if you're on DST year round you're effectively 1 timezone over without DST.
t1_dtz2cec	1	*	Did I say they weren't?
t1_dty8qd3	0	*	There's a really old Daily Mail article praising Mussolini's march on Rome and saying people that dislike Fascism are just a bunch of anti-Italian racists.

t1_dtyddym	0	*	You do realize that this does change a lot, even across a small country like Germany, right? It might be true for a specific place, but not for anything else.
t1_dty3apr	0	*	We absolutely do.

t1_dtyv1ro	1	*	Japan doesn't change their clocks if I recall. They didn't have an issue. 
t1_dtxxppe	1	*	Arizona is significantly larger than Switzerland. 
t1_dty865p	0	*	The clock decides nothing, it just indicates the time.
t1_dty4urx	1	*	Winters up here are really horrific. Sun up at 9 and sun down at 1430 where I live. Essentially it is dawn and then dusk.
t1_dty3qyw	0	*	Ok, but assuming we did away with the ST/DST shift, would you rather have an extra hour of daylight in the morning or evening?
t1_dty2zbk	0	*	hint: check his date
t1_dtxzigj	1	*	You can store a local adjustment for a specific timestamp, but you need to store a locale for a lot of other things.
t1_dty9e2e	0	*	What extra work ? Most clocks do it automatically already. Jesus.
t1_dtz1cf8	1	*	You mean you want your job to start an hour earlier and end an hour earlier.   More daylight in your afternoon, without maintaining a suddenly permanent arbitrary concept. 
t1_dtxytl8	0	*	What, you don't people bitch?
t1_dtyp5h4	0	*	But that's what DST already does.
t1_dty1izm	1	*	Not all of us get to work in greenfield projects you know. It takes just one developer who didn't know how timezones work and 10 years from now someone will still have to deal with trying to fix data.
t1_dtycym2	1	*	It's a cold, hypothetical. Currently we have DST and are synchronised with the neighbouring EU countries. If they get rid of DST, I just hope Switzerland follows.
t1_dtyb7w9	1	*	Me too man, me too. I dont want to drive home in the dark, I finish at 5, why the fuck is it dark at 5. 5 is daytime.  \- me every winter.

t1_dty0eb3	1	*	Wall clocks, microwaves, ovens, bedside alarm clocks. People still use these things. 
t1_dty5vof	0	*	But there are countries all over the world that change to DST at different times of the year and some dont at all. Its hardly unchartered territory.
t1_dty8hax	0	*	Was more one electricity saved / more productivity +- 0.1%. And wouldn't 234 hours extra sunlight without switching be even better?
t1_dtxyfuw	0	*	Have you ever tried marijuana edibles to help you sleep?
t1_dtxz7qs	0	*	And I was walking down the street one day
t1_dtxzzna	1	*	The clocks should always be set back, never forward. That way, I'd get more sleep every time, not less, and I wouldn't complain about it. The sun is now rising at 11 p.m.? Worth it for the sleep.
t1_dtxzy24	1	*	welcome to the arctic circle

t1_dt234ww	1	*	You gotta love war
t1_dt2894a	1	*	You cant trust any mexicans with authority. Period. 
t1_dt29kql	0	*	Totally a fact. American police are definitely beheading people in the streets.
t1_dt1t0q6	1	*	Maybe just a few individuals.  It could also be that these Americans were tied to some cartels, or at least the Marines thought so, and they decided to just skip the trial.   
t1_dt2xon2	1	*	CDU vs AfD? I'll take that bet, and I won't even schmooze with Arabian oligocrats while doing it.

t1_dueo8u6	0	*	I live in a country with a very sizeable Russian minority. What you describe is pretty normal among Russians. If you're stronger or there's more of you, you're the boss.

t1_dueanvt	1	*	I had a connecting flight in Moscow. I didnt need any special paperwork or visa but I was very careful not to leave the International terminal
t1_duekhmn	1	*	Well scrapping the TPP when the GOP was always for it is one. 
t1_duekrhu	1	*	I think their main concern was that US prisons aren't equipped to handle / don't care about suicidal inmates, and thus they'd essentially be sending him to his death, which was not okay.

t1_duac6ch	0	*	Yeah no. If you wanna point out hypocrisy, get to the point instead of vaguely alluding to it.  Because i can honestly say i am the least hypocritical person in this thread.

t1_duilpps	1	*	Chapter 5 will blow your mind.
t1_duhgjg9	1	*	History's decent though. You in theory learn analysis of sources which is vitally important. Having some knowledge of what's gone before so you're less likely to repeat it can't hurt either

t1_dsck32k	0	*	Proper insulation, don't go crazy on the windows, get a 2-stage 95% furnace and buy a sweater.  It's possible to live in a >300sqft house without running a furnace 24/7.

t1_dsinhvv	0	*	Regulations and the fact that UK cant independently pass laws for its own benefit. Lost of sovereignty etc etc.   It's the same as owning your own house vs living in a housing association.

t1_dsk79m3	1	*	Colin Powel is a fucking war criminal.
t1_dsix5ah	1	*	Blindly doing the opposite of what someone proposes based on their past and personality is the same as blindly following someone due to their cult of personality.

t1_duusfof	0	*	> Hell, you take Trump jokes out of his program and he would already be out of the show.  I mean, he did three seasons when Trump wasn't even on the map, so....

t1_dtfd754	0	*	This. The divide between rural and urban India is staggering. 
t1_dtfnecr	0	*	Unethical is different than illegal. I freely admit that I find the behavior permissible but deeply troubling.  Disease - most ethical Deafness - less ethical Sexuality - very unsettling
t1_dtftzp1	1	*	Abortion might be abortion (I'd disagree in some respects), but the alternatives are very different.   Raising a child with brown eyes vs with a severe disability.
t1_dtgptmp	0	*	Compared to what India has now?  It is just an example. Good or bad is a different discussion altogether.

t1_dt4nt49	1	*	Well if you finish your work, sure. Where did I say that you should work after finishing your work?

t1_dt0hqaw	0	*	> They have tried for several years.  Perhaps they should try harder for several more years. Should we ban driving because there are a lot of accidents?
t1_dt122hv	0	*	That is such a cop out. Pass strict regulations and close down all offenders. Problem solved. The real issue is that the regulations had no teeth or were not enforced.
t1_dut0f3g	0	*	Well.  Considering what else the chinese are doing.  They are the biggest threat.
t1_dut2bkr	1	*	Yep. Military budgets are shitty wastes of money. If the big powers like China and the US reduce theirs, other countries will follow. But don't expect this to happen in this century at any rate.

t1_ds5o0ew	0	*	It might have been over your head, I apologize.  Basically, Bannon is bitter and wrote a work of fiction in retaliation.  The Guardian is a shitposting institution.  No feathers ruffled.
t1_ds6yqv7	1	*	Yeah, the Zarrab case is fascinating. I have been keeping track of it because it extends into Malaysia and the Caribbean. The grand jury testimony (if it happens) could result in other indictments.

t1_ds5f1j1	1	*	Every so often Trump says something rational. Well, rational for him.   The question must seriously for-real be asked. Do the people at the White House occasionally slip Prozac into the Diet Coke.
t1_ds5acp0	1	*	Yeah he definitely didn't write that.
t1_ds5kjo9	1	*	Billie Jean is not my lover. She's just the girl who says that I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
t1_ds5hcrk	1	*	The real question is, did when did Trump loose his mind 
t1_ds5vza1	1	*	You should make a website

t1_ds60onn	1	*	True but the alt-right is too small of a number to be of any influence. Trump followers are mostly middle America.

t1_dv36xsv	1	*	Wait--some of those comments are trolling T_D, right? Like [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uxdbn/im_donald_j_trump_and_im_your_next_president_of/d5trx7u/)...
t1_dv3hs1n	1	*	I am proudly banned from T_D because I troll them by dissing Alex fucktard Jones.
t1_dv3i4bs	0	*	As far as I can tell, the idea that CTR was ever hiring shils Hillary at all is complete fiction, let alone all the conspiracy theories that later around them.
t1_dv3l72i	1	*	Shit winds a blowin

t1_dv3iae0	1	*	lul lol
t1_dv3rntf	0	*	Id say economic growth and tax reform as its currently benefitting me the most. Extra 200$ per month on the paycheck and 401k is has been downright amazing 
t1_dv34vlg	1	*	It doesn't connect with the people who want the metaphor as a metaphor. It needs to be real to give them comfort.
t1_dv3b5va	1	*	Yeah, I heard that the hacker know as 4chan is a tough cookie. 
t1_dv32lgy	0	*	In general someone needs to solve this problem with the internet. Theres so much bad information everywhere now.
t1_dv3ji5m	0	*	OP posted that quote that people like to use that goes To learn who rules over you, simply ask who you are not allowed to criticize. They probably thought it was a Voltaire quote. Its...not.
t1_dv38a8e	0	*	Why does it always have to be Kentucky?  Not all of us are that bad.  There's Louisville, and Lexington, and....well shit.
t1_dv39bg5	1	*	So in other words you have nothing cool
t1_dv3e8a4	1	*	They don't even get normal ads,  just targeted ones.  They've run off literally all other advertisers from the sub
t1_dv3ryz2	1	*	Hey you leave /r/AskReddit out of this! I *like* seeing the same questions every month!
t1_dv3bgne	0	*	Thank you for asking. Last time I offered my side of the argument I was demonized and downvoted into oblivion. 
t1_dv357n1	1	*	free
t1_dv3bbl3	1	*	This would be great, but half the country believes the Russian propaganda, because they voted for Putin's puppet. 
t1_dv3jb2v	0	*	We're talking about russian troll content being hosted.   You idiots. 
t1_dv3j3tl	1	*	Well, I specifically meant blaming them for allowing Russians in. T_D is a separate complaint and you're not wrong. 
t1_dv3go3w	0	*	Politics was removed from being a default sub in 2013.  Also there arre no default subs anymore.
t1_dv3fgkc	1	*	Lol you have to purchase that shit? Jesus christ people! It's essentially an emoji next to someone's name. Curious how much is it?
t1_dv3i549	1	*	It absolutely has worldwide reach, which cannot be measured simply in terms of subscriber, comment or upvote numbers. 
t1_dv3lbu7	0	*	The russians cant have been involved because there are idiots in America  Great thinking
t1_dv3dypf	0	*	And what distinguishes that from a Russian troll to you?
t1_dv35as5	1	*	Sounds like the liberal bots are doing a much better job then. Or are those all real people?
t1_dv3ecir	1	*	Don't worry, man. No one blames the Russian people for the bullshit of the government. 
t1_dv3741t	0	*	I don't think they're being serious...note the totally not a Russian troll subtext lol
t1_dv3bg9n	1	*	Lol. I absolutely don't endorse white nationalist groups, but I think we must unfortunately work with them to achieve white nationalist goals.
t1_dv37kc8	0	*	yeah, and breitbart isn't even close to right wing 
t1_dv3p97c	0	*	I know. Cant change how it is though 
t1_dv37b5i	1	*	when we didn't want the joke to end
t1_dv3e5du	1	*	He's *dangerously willing.*
t1_dv36swe	0	*	Id say its about half true. If a comment that is slightly disapproving or something he said is upvoted enough they will keep it around. Net positive comments only though 
t1_dv5bkco	1	*	Did they? We are still waiting for evidence on any of that. And those orgs i mentioned certainly influenced more people. 
t1_dv3n1d9	0	*	Andrew Johnson, not Andrew Jackson. Wouldnt want to sully Jacksons racist self. 
t1_dv3bt9f	1	*	Who have they hammered that conservatives?
t1_dv4j947	0	*	I was more talking about fake news. There were a handful of manipulated protests. But the fake news overwhelmingly targeted the right because the right would buy into it.

t1_dv378do	0	*	What a coincidence that they don't show both sides of the same story, or even attempt to have an inkling of being a devils advocate. Journalism USED to include some sort of rebuttal.
t1_dv35xz1	0	*	Maybe they could get users to do it in exchange for gold credits or something
t1_dv36sea	1	*	Which would mean there are real people out there supporting the POTUS and the  t_d is russia thing is then irrelevant.
t1_dv3hn7m	0	*	> last March   It's 2018 dude
t1_dv37xf1	0	*	Even if a more stringent API key policy were implemented, theres nothing stopping botters from using things like selenium to simply interact with reddit like a regular user. 
t1_dv3go68	0	*	I like how you said it's not because of their opinions and then proceeded to list off your opinion of their opinions. I'm sure the irony is lost in you. 
t1_dv36utz	1	*	Yep. If you've got bots/farms to make the initial hateful comments, you've certainly got bots/farms to upvote them.
t1_dv35qbo	0	*	If that's the case we need to make them prove it.  Seems like an easy excuse to use.
t1_dv36w3i	1	*	just like when you get banned from several subs that shall remain nameless just for posting on td.
t1_dv3jkpq	0	*	Man you are everywhere I normally see you on r/steroids but even just browsing Reddit normally I see you goddamn everywhere 
t1_dv394n1	1	*	Yes
t1_dv38joa	1	*	For breaking the rules, sure. If you are going to play the ban victim let's see some screen grabs?
t1_dv3acar	0	*	And how would a IT web admin know the difference between a Russian using an American masked IP address and somebody actually from America?
t1_dv3aso5	1	*	This is the *worst* remake of The Producers..
t1_dv38fii	0	*	Two. Andrew Johnson was impeached. Nixon was en route to impeachment, but resigned before the knives came out.
t1_dv36p5f	0	*	Amen, like that michael moore guy, famous trump supporter, who got duped by russians into a fake pro-trump rally. 
t1_dv3cdd8	0	*	Like when they slip up and say they need some petrol instead of gas.
t1_dv48y69	1	*	Nothing is in the same level as ridiculous as t_d  Give me a break.
t1_dv3w3sm	1	*	They ded
t1_dv367sa	0	*	This is why they deserve to be banned   https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/comment/dp6youa
t1_dv37l1k	1	*	absolutely 100% true
t1_dv4p8gc	1	*	> Bernie voters were manipulated to not vote at all  Oh you must mean when it was leaked that the DNC was favoring Hillary.  Yeah, that's manipulation.  You guys are funny.
t1_dv3evxs	0	*	Do you have argument? Or are you just gonna screech and call everyone names?
t1_dv3dt9q	1	*	I got banned from t_d for saying it's easy to get banned. Still here in world news though... 
t1_dv3jonq	0	*	Well, except where they don't ban anyone who dares to post an unpopular comment. Also r/politics was always left-leaning, even during the Obama years
t1_dv36h3b	0	*	Hell I'd like proof/sources on your claims because anyone can say that about any opposition group.
t1_dv3jgjd	1	*	Thanks. I've been subscribed to that sub for a while and still didn't know that 
t1_dv3epnv	1	*	How could Reddit's posting system not notice this? Surely the only crutch would be joke posts where everyone comments the same punchline, or when two users only say like a word or two.
t1_dv3nupn	0	*	>At least r/politics lets you voice your opinion irregardless of how pro or anti trump it is.
t1_dv32iqn	1	*	Yupp, because a man who accidentally wins doesn't campaign non stop for the last two weeks of the election 
t1_dv3d7bq	1	*	Every time^*   That's the only kind of post allowed there. They actually have a whitelist of news sources they allow. Though to be fair, briteshart is whitelisted.
t1_dv3eqdc	0	*	To be fair, going on 4chan is going to be a slog, they're going to need SO MANY cops on call just to handle the child porn.
t1_dv36fd7	1	*	When a radical lefty terrorist chains himself to a tree so it doesn't get chopped down, you can alert the authorities. 
t1_dv36nzc	0	*	How about just the icon of a robot? U0001f916 
t1_dv3gpx1	1	*	If they need a break after the_donald they're going to need a lobotomy after 4chan...
t1_dv36pv8	0	*	The DNC, Obama, Hillary, and the DOJ (FISA courts in particular) were spoofed by some salacious and unverified (Comey's words, not mine) Russian propaganda too.
t1_dv36yzp	0	*	How does that have anything to do... nevermind. Don't care. 
t1_dv3h131	0	*	THE CULT OF PERSONALITY
t1_dv3a83w	0	*	why? He's not your President. Maybe Reddit shouldn't allow anyone except Americans to participate in American politics since everyone is concerned about meddling from other countries. 
t1_dv36sgm	0	*	There's a lot of it on /r/shitpoliticssays. Take a look there. 
t1_dv39h7c	1	*	Shut down the TPP for starters.
t1_dv36l54	1	*	implying reddit admins would ever give preferential treatment to a republican/libertarian subreddit, topkek
t1_dv3b4dl	1	*	They definitely hopped into any issue that would pit conservatives vs liberals. 
t1_dv3ckr3	1	*	Thoughts and prayers go to the investigators who had to pull through that.
t1_dv3iwel	0	*	How about you support your assertion that he lied, since youre so interested in fact checking. 
t1_dv3dy9y	0	*	>Steve Bannon bragging about getting rootless white males radicalized:  >>*posts editorialized supposition about Bannon*
t1_dv38or8	1	*	What happened yesterday then when Trump started talking about taking peoples guns without due process? 
t1_dv37oq9	0	*	Is an orange orange?
t1_dv39b7i	1	*	I think it's really just that a turd sandwich with an R could have beat Hilldog with those turnout levels. 
t1_dv39x2r	0	*	At the expense of sounding dumb, what exactly is this canary clause that was removed, and how did it relate to Reddit or TD?
t1_dv3ww95	1	*	> I've stopped purchasing reddit gold for this reason.  you see things the right way, /u/all4reddit.  i hope you Nazi Gold like this ever again...or at least, until shit here changes.
t1_dv3bfzx	1	*	A break? These people saw what was next on their list and *quit*.
t1_dv36nbc	1	*	Do you have link to the full story?
t1_dv3dbhy	1	*	What? Reddit lets LateStageCapitalism have their guillotine memes. There was [one on their front page a few weeks ago.](https://archive.fo/BKV2B#selection-3399.0-3439.0) Did something change?
t1_dv39s91	0	*	the idiots are the people that don't know what side they're on. hint: the only correct side is in the middle. We help people find it.
t1_dv3h9ds	1	*	I dont even see many republicans with sensible economic policy anymore though, so I really dont think voting an R into power does much good in general, unless the specific candidate has better policy.
t1_dv3duv5	1	*	They spent One MEEEELION dollars!
t1_dv3a04x	0	*	All I said was she received ten million from a foreign country, still mad? Stay small, MAGA <3
t1_dv3j92x	1	*	I peek in there once in a while and it really does take a toll on you lol such a strange place..
t1_dv3bi97	1	*	What if we just set off an EMP on the Internet? It would kill all the robots and it is brilliant. I will take my Nobel Peace prize now plz. 
t1_dv3xw41	0	*	Again guilty of what?
t1_dv3nzye	1	*	Uhhhh Mister Mueller?.... theres something here about a guy putting his cock inside a human skull?  Sounds like the sort of dumb shit Eric would do... mark it pertinent
t1_dv381im	0	*	Better than the four T_D subreddits you're active in.. what is the exchange rate between rubels and dollars? I bet you guys have a great exchange program. 
t1_dv3aayu	1	*	> they probably need a break before they dive into 4Chan.   Who doesn't?
t1_dv378li	1	*	> You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion. LL Cool Rob Hubbard
t1_dv36222	0	*	might not be worth the damage they do tho
t1_dv38d6u	0	*	It's been that long, how time flies!
t1_dv409j6	1	*	Haha not true at all.
t1_dv3cqxs	0	*	Heinlein is such a good author... why hang with that miserable dude who made a religion to use people.  Hubbard is also a mediocre writer at best.  A couple good books with hundreds of had ones 
t1_dv3stla	1	*	Exactly. If they want to waist state money on a meme that makes me laugh I am perfectly fine with it. It's just the internet. Shits weird here and I wouldn't want it any other way.
t1_dv3bikc	1	*	Maybe, maybe not. But we should keeping a critical mindset seeing how we are discussing the Russian government infiltrating the_Donald 
t1_dv3bso0	1	*	A new, morally correct Reddit is what I need
t1_dv35k0d	1	*	How is this /r/politics doing the job the media cant when everything is a link to a story made by ... *the media*?
t1_dv3h7lu	0	*	That's my point. I think if shit were ever to end up on Trump's shoes it likely won't be til the end of this term. Hopefully it'll at least damage his chances of re-election. 
t1_dv3h276	1	*	 I can't ask anything on T_D.  I got banned after one comment.
t1_dv43amr	1	*	Well in my opinion the Jedi are evil! 
t1_dv36ueq	1	*	Hate speech and treason. Everything in his post is about hate speech. And treason.
t1_dv34tfy	1	*	Not reddit's job. 
t1_dv3mxm0	0	*	Don't let facts get in the way of you equating white supremacists with people who hate white supremacy  Your children will wince at the thought that they're related to you. Morally bankrupt trash. 
t1_dv48u0u	1	*	Even worse. Go mooch off the state.
t1_dv3opqh	1	*	Is that even saved anywhere?  Does 4chan back up conversations for longer than the short amount of time that threads can be participated in?
t1_dv3tew2	0	*	>Things like that are the usual tell with the proficient russian troll  This was an old ass lady who shared a thing or two on Facebook. So....
t1_dv35zja	1	*	T_D.  SRD, or /r/SubredditDrama Is just a meta subreddit that converses about dramatic events on reddit.
t1_dv377yb	0	*	And that's wrong too, what's your point? Being banned for just questioning X thing is a clear sign of an echo chamber, and even worse if it's just on your first post, you can't deny that.
t1_dsweuwx	1	*	>You are either grossly ignorant or evil. I believe the latter.  Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
t1_dsx5d3m	1	*	Dude, there's troops all around the world. Does this negate the fact that the wars ended?

t1_dt5tr8h	1	*	Like at voting time, right?
t1_dt5jenv	0	*	What does that have to do with China
t1_dt7iaf1	1	*	Is that when they lost Tibet and Manchuko as well? 
t1_dt5kdip	0	*	It's hard, but it's critical. Being too quick to criticize and falling for confirmation biases is what is dividing our country, not the president. He's clearly not helping either however.
t1_dt8wwes	0	*	Thank you for confirming that you didn't comprehend my original comment.
t1_dt5x8wl	0	*	Lincoln? The guy owned slaves? Ok...
t1_dt63e81	0	*	Trump is the best president in history, deal with it you little bitch. 
t1_dt5zc51	1	*	It kind of was.  It wasn't a surprise how it turned out, and the right sets the agenda.
t1_dtap5to	1	*	I was trying to be sarcastic, but I guess I suck at it.  I was comparing Amsterdam to this month's US shooting statistics that came out this week and someone pointed above
t1_dtax9ov	1	*	I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything.   Spoiler: I don't care what you think.
t1_dt5zsnh	1	*	Russias last wargame a few months back was a mock EU invasion, we agree on that? Now that is completely unrelated and Im just making a ridiculous argument? Maybe.
t1_dth6xj7	1	*	Oh you silly troll you :)
t1_dth5u1c	0	*	Ah yes, autisticperson123, the ambassador for all Dutch people.
t1_dspjply	0	*	The Israeli Offense Force.
t1_dspooeh	0	*	Yes, I'm sure you got the context right. What was meant is that the bullet had a charge. They didnt mean it was a *real*, regular bullet. You're right buddy.
t1_dspta3l	1	*	Investigation doesn't = It happened
t1_dspu8c6	0	*	Regardless you were still implying a lack of care you shouldn't be shooting them around 3 year olds  There is (of yet) no credible evidence that any such thing occurred.
t1_dspjctx	0	*	Don't see some Palestinian fanboy linking and bragging tho? 
t1_dspkk9w	1	*	I am sorry I have not made myself clear the previous time. I asked for *credible* news sources.
t1_dsqi02w	1	*	[So you don't have a better source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Monitor) Just the same report given credence because it is repeated.

t1_dttm0u5	1	*	It was a 2016 model purchased in 2017. I put a decent amount of highway miles on it in the first few months of ownership 
t1_dtufgvi	0	*	One brother opted for lethal injection, the other *chose* the gas chamber over lethal injection.  Their crimes fit the punishment of execution and they were both given the choice.
t1_dtvghqz	1	*	Understood. Bodywork is expensive and it was an amazing offer. 
t1_dtv3er5	1	*	Im going to guess the Nazis! (How this relates to the original comment tho, idk)
t1_dtul7ke	0	*	This logic doesnt make sense...
t1_dtumhh5	1	*	Why ouch? Also pretty ironic your name is the current hot selling suv at VW.   Source: I sell VW's.
t1_dv4eatc	1	*	 If the only so called source is the self claimed victims themselves
t1_dv47f49	1	*	Mostly likely they are spies. 
t1_duirk8k	1	*	>Germany has plenty of free jobs  Now if only the real wages from those free jobs had actually risen in the past 20 years, then it might actually matter what the unemployment rate is.
t1_dtj49q5	0	*	Release everything! Nothing should be hidden. Both parties are so corrupt its crazy the people try and defend either one of em. Such a shame. 
t1_dsgkliy	1	*	I guess it's perfectly justifiable then.
t1_dv2esbv	0	*	>it's from the people whose entire purpose is around using the scientific method to find the truth and explain the universe.  Does this include All Gore? 
t1_dv2j34k	1	*	Is this a joke? Trump won't be winning a second term. He probably won't even be nominated to run again. He might not even make it through his first term!
t1_dv2h3mh	1	*	Trump might pick his private pilot to run the FAA, for what its worth. Although that may or may not count depending on how he stands on issues
t1_dv2kjhj	0	*	Does it count as captured if they let them name the DC airport the Ronald Reagan airport after the guy who broke up the air traffic control strike?
t1_dv2n0sq	0	*	Pruitt is the worst director of the EPA since Anne Gorsuch.
t1_dv2dwp4	1	*	Ha, they only seem all innocent, the reality is way more twin peaks than yogi bear.  
t1_dtdhjn9	0	*	LOL Trump's so good at vetting people too
t1_duc8ctk	1	*	Tell that to the United States legislature.
t1_duc7tly	1	*	kool
t1_duc8p6v	1	*	It was. But it's not too distant from the mentality of some hardcore leftists who defend people like this drug dealer.
t1_duc9c15	1	*	No it doesn't.
t1_ducs2do	1	*	pretty easy to acquire that knowledge and doesn't require maintaining hostages.

t1_ducapi2	0	*	I mean regular people are ALSO a violent bunch if you're dealing with anything more than a handful of people.
t1_duc9njm	0	*	But that isn't what happens. No criminal would turn them self in to get vaccinated. You just gets unvaccinated criminals.
t1_duc7k38	1	*	O ok, just curious. 
t1_dt9c1jz	0	*	Even if US was a taken signatory of the Paris climate agreement it is better than not being one. It allows people other than climate change deniers/ignorant to look forward to a better future

t1_dtab5fi	0	*	thats not how people sleep unless you take sleep aids, most people physically cant do that
t1_dtf0t0a	1	*	If were going to look at the suicide and accident rates then we have to take emotion out of it and be objective about the numbers. The total amount for the full year is what matters. 
t1_dt9u4xe	1	*	It's interesting because in a way, in order to facilitate dst, every part of society has to change their timetable by 1 hour.
t1_dt9u1wq	1	*	Why would it be a problem waiting for the bus before sunrise? We have street lights nowadays.

t1_dsew314	0	*	Its legal to have a blacklist - its still evidence towards google having a bias which may be causing a hostile environment for some of its employees.
t1_dsezwux	0	*	Many comments are made every day here which dont use he tag and the sarcasm is just fine. Well done sarcasm doesnt need the tag, and is completely ruined by it.

t1_dsxt37v	0	*	> The agreement ignored Debaltsevo because the Ukrainian army thought they could break the encirclement.  That's not true and does not match up with the time line.  Try again.

t1_dtrvbwc	1	*	Yeah this hits the nail on the head exactly! 
t1_dtrp396	1	*	Back in the old days there wasn't even a news feed.  You had to go to somebody's page to see what they put on it.
t1_dttvjmr	1	*	Well he had posted pics and I thought it was going to be like Craig's where I just look it up. 
t1_dtremtu	0	*	It was kung-fu, what's your shtoyle is a reference to Enter The Dragon.

t1_dtrgq2t	1	*	Well said. I miss the 2007ish Facebook. It was fun while it lasted. 
t1_dtrn4tk	1	*	My wife's calls with her family usually have the words he doesn't actually use his Facebook 
t1_dtrnpxs	1	*	Glad it worked out but I'd advise against that in future, its just unnecessary risk and invites complications.
t1_dtranmc	1	*	Been in those back hill Ohio towns.  Wowza, might as well just call Wal-Mart the Guns N Beer store.

t1_dtraz92	1	*	> They're already showing more ads and Recommended for You posts in your (non-chronological) feed.  i hate the video ads...  it's still better than FB garbage spam wall of crap  
t1_dtrdax8	1	*	Same. Coincidentally I found reddit by googling the username of a fellow forum user at the time. 
t1_dtrgqd9	1	*	Nah, it's pretty much dead as a social platform here in the rest of the world, too.
t1_dtra6u1	0	*	It was definitely closer to fairly balanced before the 2016 presidential election kicked-off.
t1_dtrpjxu	0	*	It's not straightforward for an ordinary user to configure their privacy settings correctly and fully. This is deliberate, by design, Facebook profits from each post having a wider audience.
t1_dtrfd13	1	*	There are tons of subs dominated by memes and circlejerks, sure you can have decent discussions here but Reddit is far from *pure*.
t1_dtrbi0i	1	*	And yet instagram keeps getting shitty in the same ways Facebook did. Not expecting much from Zuck. 
t1_dtrnzym	0	*	^for ^your ^safety
t1_dtrgx3a	1	*	they still have forums, just super niche (like Nirvana, game development etc...) (my taste, anyways)
t1_dtra189	0	*	The only option is to unfollow them. That's what I did, but the fucking minute long ads in the middle of 30 second videos is what gets me.
t1_dtratrt	1	*	Hey man, sometimes there's just nothing better to do.
t1_dtr9ly4	1	*	Yeah. Things gonna get weird.
t1_dtrl1me	0	*	The difference is your regular news feed still contains content from pages, the experiment is that it only contains content from your friends.
t1_dtrl2di	1	*	For me its more like Oh, you watched this video, we recommend you watch this same video, but its been uploaded by someone else! over and over again.

t1_du0186e	1	*	Most of the stink in my house comes from the living, unfortunately. 
t1_dtra58c	1	*	Well, they would never say no. You know, because of the implication.
t1_dtrdjkn	1	*	I read that in a country voice... Not sure why...
t1_dtrbelh	1	*	At least your town is big enough to justify a Walmart.
t1_dtrcssi	1	*	Honesty.   I grew up in a small town and this is 100% truth. Now I'm in a larger town and I haven't been inside a Walmart in 5 years. 
t1_dtrg7nn	1	*	Vodeo 
t1_dtrgxgi	1	*	Instagram is arguably worse. In my feed post are between 6 minutes and 6 DAYS old. Like, why the fuck?!

t1_dtrk913	1	*	OP edited their comment. Might want to edit yours too haha. 
t1_dtroqwz	1	*	Cue my recommendations all being about gross earwax removal. I saw a post/video on  reddit and watched  1-2 more to satisfy my /r/oddlysatisfying craving...
t1_dtrc8k4	1	*	We used to go and fill up carts like were shopping and then open boxes of wine and walk around drinking. Were such little assholes.
t1_dtrc5ue	1	*	But will the attraction of the change bring enough people such as yourself black to the platform that more ads get viewed and clicked? That's what they are testing for. 
t1_dtrn7m6	1	*	>I don't know what the fuck happened.  Facebook found it to be more profitable brokering in bile and misery than actual informational updates.  
t1_dtrhg70	1	*	Ha! Try saying something logical that doubts the basis of the Mueller investigation and see how far that goes.
t1_dtrda65	1	*	so, you only go there because you don't have a choice.  I think you proved op's point.
t1_dtrcq2v	1	*	Source? Not disagreeing but would like to know if data like this exist

t1_dtiayjo	1	*	Yeah I noticed some things around  some of the ideas coming out of the humanities vs biology in the book. All in all I thought it was an awesome book though.
t1_dthjdxh	1	*	They still do. But saying that just because you're a Democrat doesn't mean that you'd have to support a Democrat president doing as much shady shit as Trump 
t1_dthbddz	1	*	Correct. Which is why I said this isn't an open and shut case.
t1_dth6o6y	1	*	God, having a look at the private emails of some politicians, whew. So many fake conservatives, such blatant racism, such collusion and bribery.

t1_dthfa5h	1	*	We may be speaking it here but some people might understand another language better

t1_dti245s	1	*	That would be great! Then I could still be anti-trump, but truly vote for the smaller candidate that I align with more.
t1_dti1lg3	1	*	And now on to wording of responses instead of their points. Not even masking pure defensiveness.   OK. I'll bite. How is it being used wrong exactly?
t1_dthatvp	1	*	Man you know someone has nothing of value to say when they constantly being up Hillary as a defense. Also quit posting spam links to shit YouTube videos
t1_dthnpmy	0	*	Which is exactly why changing the voting system to *anything* else should be everyone's top priority. Unfortunately neither party wants anyone to know about this

t1_dthgkt3	1	*	Don't spread lies

t1_dthhzz9	1	*	True justice is incredibly bright to behold, and to some even blinding. Those on the wrong side of it tend to prefer the cool shade of the dark.

t1_dthgrmc	0	*	Not OP but the Economist has a very didactic style. Their articles are often opinion posing as cut and dried fact, with no exploration of a counter-opinion. Personally I hate it. 
t1_dthgo2c	0	*	It's only true on healthcare though...
t1_dtikhv2	1	*	It was the long con. If the Soviet Union was still around, it would be much much worse.

t1_dtixuhz	0	*	The argument is that it would be better to have a president whos openly a piece of shit than a president who is only secretly a piece of shit 
t1_dthfvh6	1	*	I remember the first time I read 1984, I thought the whole doublespeak thing was ridiculously stupid.  I mean, I still do, but now it's real.
t1_dthevrn	1	*	Trump fans demonize anonymous sources because (as they say) they think 'anonymous' = 'a lie', which is of course nonsense.  As for the rest, many Trump fans believe in 'Pizzagate'.
t1_dthl0gy	0	*	Sorry but a majority of our population didnt want that wretch to be the figure head of our country... even if it is all just an illusion
t1_dti67xu	1	*	I find it a refreshing change from the corruption.  Trump is the first good person to hold the presidency in my life.
t1_dthee27	1	*	Yep. Both sides are the same is a lie that has only ever helped the Republicans.
t1_dthl5ft	0	*	You understand that a person can repeat a lie told by another person right? Its not as if Cody Shearer has never heard of the Steele Dossier.

t1_dth8cuc	0	*	I meant the black and Hispanic unemployment rates are at record lows. Anyway, you guys are in for a rude awakening regarding this Russia bullshit.
t1_dthbo2p	1	*	If the DNC fucked themselves, then 30% of Americans fucked the US.
t1_dth41vh	0	*	Obstruction of justice is also part of that investigation.  EDIT: Also 2 people already pleaded guilty.  Also, special kind of mental gymnastics.
t1_dti0rd0	1	*	To be honest? I don't really care if he did or not. Whatever he is into in the bedroom is none of my business.

t1_dthg44b	0	*	Umm, it's actually this 'collusion' that's the original conspiracy without any concrete evidence. 
t1_dthbrfe	1	*	This is assuming there's direct scaling with being a super power and whether or not schools teach critical thinking skills.
t1_dthrseq	1	*	>both sides of the same coin.  [Bullshit](https://imgur.com/a/VXl1K)

t1_dth4d04	0	*	Accurate for West Coast, though I've heard 80's too. East coast sounds about right. For middle America I'd say 60's. 
t1_dtj6mtw	1	*	Well, the easiest thing is seeing when they contradict themselves, as Trump does constantly. That doesn't require any outside authority to figure out. 
t1_dtio6n2	0	*	Wait...the news that is going to focus on an individual incident to emphasize a situation and sell you that paper/click? 
t1_dthdvvi	0	*	I'm only 25% Russian but my grandparents moved away in the early 1900s. Does that make me a bot?

t1_dtgz0sm	1	*	> Maybe there are people you care about in Russia   This implies that Trump cares about anything other than himself and his daughter's pussy. So it's discredited.
t1_dtgzml7	0	*	Should I fix my statement and say that sanctions rarely work? Still dont think I mislead anybody and even the article mention how rarely sanctions work....

t1_dtgi63h	1	*	No, you won't. You armchair activists will do nothing as always. Same as the millions of neoliberals and the tens of celebrities who claimed they'd leave the US if Trump won the election. 
t1_dtgkysv	0	*	> Also, the law has guidelines and determinations of what Russia needs to do (or stop doing) in order to lift sanctions.   I may have misunderstood -- why did you bring this up then?

t1_dth0bvc	0	*	Idk are they?  You seem to imply white people are going to rise up and vote for trump because they are being made fun of. Thats surely a good reason to vote for a imbecile 
t1_dtgatwj	1	*	What BS. Cut it out. 
t1_dth46wv	0	*	Sure, a healthy level of skepticism is good. And I agree, violence isn't appropriate. Are you saying that what he's done is acceptable though?

t1_dtyknk0	0	*	Because those dont fall on the left/right paradigm and are authoritarian/libertarian beliefs that literally have nothing to do with what we are taking about
t1_dtyzvgt	1	*	Fake news has been a real thing since the invention of news. We're just more effective at deciphering bullshit now that anybody can look at the sources or evidence for themselves.

t1_dtyjv8j	1	*	The political world, the media and message boards are full of fake left. These masqueraders serve a variety of purposes.  
t1_dtzkpze	1	*	Because the information was misused to paint the DNC and Hillary in a bad light to make voters who would never vote for Trump also not go vote for Hillary.
t1_dtzm8ze	1	*	> He cant think, How can we both win? He only thinks, How do I win, you lose?  That describes Trump as well.
t1_dtyo09a	1	*	Yep.  This sums it up quite nicely.

t1_dtevpzu	0	*	The muslim household were shiaa or sunni? And where are they from?
t1_dtf73p0	1	*	I disagree. Religion was created to make sense of the world and life. Even organized religion spanned many nations as it grew. It's organized religion that is about power imo.
t1_dtf3fbv	0	*	I didn't generalize feminism, I gave two examples of bullshit feminist assertions I've seen in the last week. Do you listen to yourself when *you* talk?

t1_duwl4de	1	*	As someone married to a doctor and with doctors for almost all close family members, that's very much not an accurate timeline for pretty much any doctor. 
t1_duwz1am	0	*	Salary is determined not just on what your skills are but also on how hard it is to replace you. So another factor is whether there is an abundance or shortage of Doctors vs Nurses.

t1_duwv54t	1	*	Yeah I always assumed living there would be awesome
t1_duwxl0l	0	*	What's the difference between quitting and declaring yourself unfit to work?  A nurse doesn't have to work in a hospital, there are schools, nursing homes, Dr offices, etc
t1_duwo8t2	0	*	Doctors in Quebec have the right to incorporate and pay less tax because they are then considered a business. So they pay nowhere close to even the effective tax rate for over 200k.

t1_du0nfvi	1	*	A portion of the article I found interesting, one  that also acts to combat the conspiracy leapers of all stripes.
t1_du1pv3a	1	*	No, it's Russia's own reporting on Oswald. They knew he was a shill so they were monitoring him.

t1_dsuerll	0	*	The stronger the DPRK the less likely any foreign aggression against it and therefore war on the Korean peninsula. The credible threat of a nuclear counter-strike prevents aggression.
t1_dsievua	1	*	Sorry I misunderstood you. What I was arguing was that if it becomes illegal in most if not all European countries, then they'd travel to other countries with worse medical staff.

t1_ds7smh2	1	*	Good on you. My wallet won't allow for that right now and eating meat is more important to me than whatever animal suffering the meat industry here in Germany is responsible for.
t1_ds75zb1	0	*	Um... Source please? I'm very curious about who experienced euphoria getting shot in the head or gassed.
t1_ds6ldjz	0	*	I'm sure the daily mail has ran articles against it here in the UK, under titles like frankenfarms and other scaremongering
t1_ds6n9nv	0	*	Yes, it's our inalienable right to kill and cause suffering to animals even if our technology deems it unnecessary
t1_ds6ilcl	0	*	New fad in the future.  Rich people who only eat meat cloned from them selves as other meat in beneath them. Autocannibalism, or autosarcophagy the newest fad diet.

t1_dtu4bdh	0	*	Yeah, if you don't think about it, everything sounds a lot like what you feel like regardless of the information presented...
t1_dttvj12	1	*	China is ALWAYS keeping stuff like this off the front page and you see the same damn usernames defending the ccp's mountain of skulls in every thread
t1_dttoq07	1	*	Americans are especially weak to propaganda? I guess American Exceptionalism had a point after all!

t1_dswg7zu	1	*	Yeah, it's the fault of the people with no power, not the corrupt dictator who pillaged and mismanagemed the country. You have no empathy or understanding 
t1_dswf4hg	1	*	A year, you say?

t1_dsuvao3	1	*	Ironically how many Haitians are called African Americans 
t1_dsv6bos	0	*	I gotcha. The fact that Americans wont do the job is a sign the wages need to be higher. Thats something we can all get behind.

t1_dsv4sb2	1	*	> The US is about the only country that doesn't have very strong immigration policies.   Well, I'm not sure they're not very strong but either way immigrants are what the US *wanted*.

t1_dsuqxvc	0	*	Theyre not American people
t1_dsuuo3l	0	*	there basically aren't.   there might be a few doing humanitarian work but very few white people are permanent citizens of Haiti. 
t1_dsuto0g	1	*	Of course they dont want to be named you dip  Its about evaluating the report on your own and being a living breathing person with a brain for fucks sake, how is this difficult 
t1_dsv02jg	1	*	But increasing the supply of labor means also increasing the strength their economy, which in turn makes the QOL a lot better for everyone within that economy.

t1_dsunb1p	0	*	And to be clear, youre in favor of America returning to similar policy?
t1_dsuyenj	0	*	A. ICE wasn't going to chase them down anyway.  B. 40 is minuscule and completely irrelevant to ICE's workload.  C. Thus my point, does nothing to help the country

t1_dsvg92r	0	*	You realize that if you're working under the table anyway, you have no record of income and can still get welfare, right?

t1_dsx6qdw	0	*	There were about 60,000 Haitians using TPS btw.  40% of Haitians with H2-A and H2-Bs overstayed their time in 2016.  Also. People disagreeing with you  Russian bots/Brigading
t1_dsvlvpb	1	*	No, Republicans just want special treatment for themselves.
t1_dsv5xld	0	*	Because their populations aren't necessarily made of consumers. China and India still have many substinace farmers. This doesn't really exist in America even at the very lowest level of work.

t1_dsv7yh0	1	*	Aren't domestic terrorism stats cooked too by including things like phone calls and fist fights?
t1_dswekw9	0	*	Last time I checked biological functions such as defecating are a characteristic of all human beings. However, some may have much less an cultural or ethical issue requiring a toilet.
t1_dsuy28x	1	*	They are eligible for earned income tax credit and child tax credit and do not make enough money to actually have a tax liability.  So yeah. They actually do get pretty large tax returns.

t1_dsur2o9	0	*	Ooh yeah, if you get rid of the illegal immigrants too that's a much larger number. I thought you were only referring to people on visas for low-skilled work, which is a very low number.

t1_dsusdzo	1	*	Yeah, AMAZON. I had to talk to 3 people (in India?)  about my textbook extension and they STILL fucked it up.
t1_dsv3zf0	0	*	What a disgusting racist thing to say.  What sort of bubble of shitty people do you live in? 
t1_dsuvlbk	1	*	Getting rid of unions does way, way more to decrease labor power but for some reason Republicans aren't big on unions...
t1_dsusugf	0	*	Because they only take those jobs because they can't support an American standard of living. If we didn't allow loopholes like that the owner would have to pay a living wage.

t1_dskj8qt	0	*	Completely ignoring that for Norwegians, America is a shithole. 
t1_dslc6hh	1	*	FFS. He wasn't talking about Haiti, the statement that he made was about *people from* Haiti. How do so many people not get it? How does *anyone* not get it?
t1_dskyi99	1	*	> but their condition can hardly be said to be their own fault   Looking at the last 60 years, I can confidently say that.
t1_dsk20cc	0	*	>Hes just obligated to   No he's not.
t1_dsk79cf	1	*	Haitians eat *dirt cookies* made by mixing mud and corn starch, they even have dirt cookie markets.  Google or YouTube it if you want. 
t1_dskbrje	0	*	We need all the allies and friends we can get. And you could die tomorrow and I'd be completely unaffected, as would most of the country that's not really important. 
t1_dske4s4	1	*	Are you...are you *dodging the question you can't answer*?
t1_dslag0y	0	*	Because the US isn't a charity, we should be picking the immigrants who would benefit the US the most not the other way around.
t1_dskm1cg	0	*	Sir, you have extrapolated wildy from that post. Haiti is a shithole. I don't blame them for wanting to immigrate to the US. Who am I to say no? But a shithole Haiti remains.
t1_dslhqjr	0	*	I'm talking about Trump supporters, not all registered Republicans. Sorry to take away from your eagerness to defend them.
t1_dskdp59	1	*	the truth is, we just see the irony about it when we compare your statistics to a bunch of European ones
t1_dsl0bma	1	*	The Obamas werent invited to the other royal wedding a few years back..
t1_dtip2nq	1	*	Why did you reply to yourself instead of just edit your comment?
t1_du10avc	1	*	Oh damn why didn't you say so
t1_du0ld9w	0	*	Wonder how much acupuncture he'll need to recover from that.
t1_du11fr7	0	*	You wouldn't steal a baby.
t1_du1fjgy	1	*	*notices ur gold*  OwO what's this?
t1_du0wbw8	0	*	Well any sort of group of professionals can call themselves doctors.  Doesn't mean they are anything remotely close to a M.D or Ph.D.  I hate the idea of comparing a Ph.D to a Chiro.
t1_du0s5vf	1	*	This thread is really showing how different the regulations are from place to place.
t1_du1qhr5	0	*	Wow. I would have hoped it was a joke saying it was your body trying to get rid of the remedies. Thats crazy. 
t1_du0yo0w	0	*	Its called Polony in Australia, saves a bit of confusion.
t1_du11mix	1	*	Wow. She's beating the odds, that's for sure. 
t1_du13hla	1	*	Yeah my mom had rheumatoid arthritis and didn't want to do anything invasive so we went for to an Ayurveda clinic, couldn't deal with the smell but the food made me stay hahah
t1_du6xn4u	0	*	First of all, lean? Really?  Secondly, I was saying that she was saying it was medicine mixed with sugar, but she was lying to those kids so she could then take their cough meds and get high as shit.
t1_du115ns	1	*	He wasn't shopping for anything, his girlfriend was.
t1_du19gba	1	*	When we hear someone say Im going to university we know youre a foreigner and call immigration. Its a foolproof tactic. 
t1_du0qg7d	0	*	I find that people that I have encountered who were enthusiastic about homeopathy, also lamented frequently of being broke.
t1_du12nls	1	*	Ooooh soz thought you were having a go at all 5 lol
t1_du0s5rh	1	*	Uh, no. They don't go to medical school. 
t1_du0x8bs	1	*	Calling the placebo effect as *massively effective* is massively misleading
t1_du11cyj	1	*	It's possible he just lives in America. Medicine is expensive you know?
t1_du0se8d	0	*	Chiropractors are not trained in diagnostic medicine, and chiropractic is not an AMA recognized medical speciality.   They carry and use a title of doctor analogous to how a PhD carries the title.  
t1_du10xjl	1	*	Probably r/thingsforants.
t1_du0vbos	1	*	Saying someone you care about has a B- brain as OP did is pretty shitty. I completely agree with you. 
t1_du0pbva	1	*	With cancer in it.
t1_du1bszw	0	*	I'm getting a feel for the worldnews point of view. Which clearly is not yours. Which doesn't mean I don't agree with you.
t1_du0sydp	0	*	Right. But it was a baseless statement. You have no idea what knowledge base the person bases their opinion on. By the looks of it, they are more informed than you are and certainly more polite. 
t1_du0t3sg	0	*	Math is too successful for me to believe in it.
t1_du1vvr9	0	*	That's not a deciding factor for eliminating courses but don't cry oppression when your gender studies degree doesn't pay enough for retirement.  Have you watched? Or simply ridicule out of hand?
t1_du0wlp5	1	*	Depends in which country you are. In Germany it is somewhat regulated and a chiro is usually just a normal doctor who on top had some training in chiro on top.   
t1_du18f4v	0	*	Something like valerian does help with my anxiety, no its not as innocent as people make it out to be but its not as dangerous as benzos
t1_du0uwy3	1	*	Raw water?!?!  /s
t1_du0y9kl	1	*	yes more vagina wordplay!
t1_dtbwia3	1	*	Pff, everyone knows Africa is just a homogenous continent with no variation in geopolitical atmosphere or major actors. ^^^^/s
t1_dtkanp3	1	*	And to build one without the instructions and some parts missing.
t1_dsokylt	1	*	You know nothing. 
t1_dsnt43q	1	*	spicy af 
t1_dso1327	1	*	I believe that was the point
t1_dso3ga9	1	*	Plus, it's not a random comment, there's a lot of info that can be credibly fact-checked in order to determine its veracity. 
t1_dso13av	0	*	Dey * might of

t1_dsy0ctq	1	*	Puns Kurdle my stomach
t1_dsxdrha	0	*	A country with hands and legs tied and a mouth covered with a stip of tape. Poland have to obey whatever EU or NATO tells them.
t1_dsyf9py	1	*	Turkey did worse than doing nothing when it let men and weapons flow into ISIS-held territory for two years.
t1_dsxkibg	1	*	Other way round, ISIS was selling oil they raided from Syria through turkey.
t1_dsx1pam	1	*	YPG itself is still better than the others
t1_dsy6j1y	1	*	Were you being serious when talking  about the ottoman sultans?
t1_dsx09tc	1	*	Try to see each conflict for what it is. The Syrian civil war seems to have become a war with no powerful good guys, only bad - worse - worst.
t1_dsxcq1h	0	*	They also have taken in 3.3M Syrian refugees. Syria had a population of 19M in 2014.
t1_dsxp020	0	*	How is Syria a threat to passage through the Dardanelles?
t1_dsye6mq	0	*	I mean, at this point there are videos of missiles being launched and of a captured Turkish tank, seems like its happening.
t1_dsxrkyx	1	*	its all a proxy was started by saudi arabi and usa likes them fighting iran because it erodes russias hegemony in the region
t1_dsx7fxc	1	*	True
t1_dsxhm71	1	*	>The President finally became Presidential tonight.  -All media
t1_dsyhjjz	1	*	Poland was always a country.
t1_dsxo11w	1	*	Sounds like a viable scenario. Still, Turkey and Russia have had their own issues, so it sounds bit weird that this would be the only thing.  They could have done this ages ago, if it was the case...
t1_dsxpp1d	1	*	They were doing it so well, they even determine for others.
t1_dsxrhpv	1	*	It's the same thing u see in the us, mostly uneducated folks supporting the system
t1_dsxjo3f	1	*	>He is definitely not the richest man alive.   Oh, hunny....
t1_dsxcmjo	1	*	> Kurds lean left.  No, YPG leans left as many other militant groups do. Kurds are highly religious and backwards.
t1_dsxiu3o	0	*	And the Canadians and Americans are Arabs too then
t1_dtkm54t	1	*	/r/enlightenedcentrism
t1_dtl6v8u	1	*	USA has legal corruption - lobbying. That is the main difference.
t1_dtkxiwg	0	*	But isnt that the point of democracy. Youre supposed to do good things so you get votes. 
t1_dtlgguh	1	*	Brown people getting Better healthcare and obviously education as you have questions about a very simple statement.
t1_dsgwsab	1	*	Which stops the spread of HIV.....   You don't want to stop HIV? 
t1_dsh8pmk	1	*	Just give him a trial if it's such a slam dunk (and it is).  You really gain nothing by throwing away due process.    I assume you are on the right, did Moore get a fair deal?
t1_dsgrint	0	*	Yes, only way to deal with horrible cruelty is to come up with ways to be worse.
t1_dsgutuq	1	*	Emotional appeals aside, mob justice quickly becomes a game of lets hunt all the people we don't like!
t1_dsgu7y7	1	*	Oh yeah just posters of duterte all over america right?
t1_dsh7n52	1	*	Do you have a source for that being his real name? You're correct about Abu Omer meaning father of gifted speaker, but I can't find anything about the other stuff.
t1_dsgru22	1	*	Are you fucking kidding?
t1_dsh3rld	0	*	Most far left people do not know what real fascism is. 
t1_dsgtzqd	1	*	err, it _is_ his fault in a large part, yes. That does not sound stupid at all.
t1_dsirnxm	1	*	You are dead wrong. There have been many reported cases of honor killings and beatings of LGBT in India.
t1_dsj2gih	0	*	Oh, has Baba Ram Dev converted away from Hinduism or something?
t1_dsisu87	0	*	Good conclusion, mr.internet-psychologist!   At the same time, no even one rational counter-argument to my opinion.  And it was deleted :(
t1_ds690uc	0	*	My people and their achievements, everyone else has a racial identity.
t1_dsskf7v	0	*	I was on the other side, but your reasoning got me.  No more murder/homicide belt from me
t1_dssw905	1	*	But what if the education is to blame?  Islamic extremism, the resurgence of Marxism ... It's all being taught in schools and the indoctrination is delivered as an education, is it not?
t1_dsucdnp	1	*	Fight sort of implies that either side has a chance of wnning we just bully people. 
t1_dssh26n	1	*	With the Trump news cycle 24 hours seems like a year.
t1_dssw660	1	*	Those whores
t1_dsszw6n	0	*	It was something stuck in the back of my brain. Probably a butchered quote of something I've read at some point.   My apologies to any scholars. 
t1_dssoqls	1	*	Ah. 
t1_dstayxp	1	*	Gotta be careful. The terrorists hide in civilian areas, and if youre bombing civilian areas then its easy for the enemy to keep indoctrinating ~~its~~ its children against the bombers.
t1_dssa7p0	1	*	cuz we gotta know who is the next ethnic race to die in the next hollywood action movie! duh! 
t1_dssw04p	1	*	^ This guy is Pakistani and he has the audacity to try the your country's history bullshit.
t1_dssjlt9	1	*	Terrorists = cunts 
t1_dssixgx	1	*	Tell him it's cool. 7year olds are not really into critical thinking.
t1_dsssfo2	1	*	Where did you see that?
t1_dssrofi	1	*	Well, there's only one belt, and we haven't had a cage match between the two yet.
t1_dssnqha	1	*	So? He said he's proud because an Iraqi soldier saved a young child and many more people. That has nothing to do with Iraqs history. 
t1_dsskrp3	1	*	ARE YOU RRREAADYY TOOOO RUUUUMB-LLLEEE
t1_dssqei6	1	*	The same mental gymnastics that allow to you say whatever you want about black people because you know a black guy that agrees with you on principle. 
t1_dssz57f	1	*	I think that explosive belt is the correct term, since it has no intentions one way or the other, and is easily understood for what it is.
t1_dssyep6	1	*	Honestly. Most of them were from Russia and the US.   The US gave Afghanistan tons of weapons and equipment at one point to fight against the Russians. We found that crap everywhere. 
t1_dssmgj1	0	*	if anyone thinks that toddler actually shot anyone i have a bridge to sell you
t1_dssr8ew	0	*	No, Im speaking from my side as a Muslim to show Im against these atrocities. So fuck off with the as a black man bs 
t1_dssnteu	1	*	Ah the old switcheroo 
t1_dst6khn	1	*	Or you know, they probably died in a drone strike when the CIA were targeting their neighbors.
t1_dss9rbp	0	*	Both start with 'i' close enough  I for one am sick of American aggression against Iceland
t1_dsshv22	0	*	Remember when people where responsible for what they did ?  Yeah,me neitheir.
t1_dstmtrz	1	*	of course not, but in this case it is.
t1_dst2d4y	0	*	Hating someone for something they think is extreme. Atheist's genociding Muslims is still genocide. Doesn't matter who does the genocide, you're still evil. 
t1_dsshni6	0	*	I only read the last three lines and anything preceding them can only be preposterous. Have fun in your bubble.
t1_dst77g1	1	*	Its the second choice
t1_dstbmbv	1	*	So... for it's own benefit...  I'm not hating on Iraq, I'm just saying the situation is too complex to label a particular group the good guys.
t1_dssiaq6	1	*	Cognitive dissonance is a staple of all religious thinking, extremists just take it further with their actions.
t1_dst2vis	1	*	Yeah it is difficult to win a war when its not about taking the enemy's capital. They just move across borders in between civilians.
t1_dst6na8	0	*	thats too absurd to be true, right?
t1_dsswfs8	0	*	And there's more than one kind of signal jamming technique as well. 
t1_dssvy33	0	*	Lol judging by your post history you are from Pakistan? Do you know what they say about glass houses, and the people who live in them?
t1_dssv6b5	0	*	Rwanda was also terrible if you look at the speed of the genocide.
t1_dst5tpq	1	*	Just thinking about that is making me reach for the /r/Eyebleach 
t1_dssl2yb	0	*	Westboro Baptist ARE Christians. They're certainly not Hindu
t1_dsg5jme	1	*	I don't think you understand the difference between what is being described here and the nuclear weapons dropped on Japan.
t1_du2ayri	0	*	It is more economical viable (due to many factors, including, but not limited to the subsidies of corn production) to use high corn fructose than using the real thing.
t1_dtpzk3t	1	*	Tossing up if I'd rather be blackmailed vs being woken up on a Sunday morn hungover as fuck by the doorknockers.
t1_dswoehc	0	*	Bugs at least. 
t1_dsxgeoz	0	*	540 feet for two people is tiny.
t1_dsx43ll	0	*	Yes. Welcome to a well developed nation with attractive cities and a booming economy. It is kinda inevitable.
t1_dsvk8oq	1	*	Funeral people tend to always have something to do. 
t1_dsx7vbv	1	*	You're supposed to eat the fruit.
t1_dt4a75y	1	*	Yep. There are a lot of repeat offenders in every China thread.
t1_dt4fphk	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iHZi-z7H4o
t1_dt3vbms	0	*	Im not the person you replied to but I believe it means they dont take responsibility for their actions. 
t1_dt4fxk2	1	*	Any red pill stuff for me bro?  I hear it's addictive.
t1_dt4m3yj	1	*	Yep.  China is HUGE on face, embarrass the shit out of them and they are putty in your hands.
t1_dt4afed	1	*	I don't deny it, but I think China would be as bad if not worse if they could.
t1_ds3696k	1	*	I guess right before we replaced it with Weakness Makes Right? *fails suicide attack and goes to jail*
t1_ds35usz	1	*	They were attacked, so...
t1_duww5ro	1	*	Thanks - very informative.
t1_dv178a0	0	*	I love when you conflate victim with aggressor.  Did France lost war ? Yes or no. 
t1_dv0jsaj	0	*	This is why Israel exists.  There was some unpleasantness in France recently, so a lot of Jews left for Israel. It works, even if it's not ideal.
t1_duzzs4q	1	*	Kentucky never seceded from the union, and continued legal slavery throughout the civil war.  It was exempted from Lincoln's emancipation proclamation because it was part of the union.
t1_dtg0g9w	1	*	Cameron done more damage to the people of the UK than Thatcher ever did.
t1_dtgeksh	0	*	But Belgians and Portuguese are fine. We seem to have developed a Euro-immigration snobbery; old Eastern Bloc = bad/get out. Western Europeans = ooh, you're Spanish. How do I say tits in Spanish?
t1_dtg0cvo	0	*	Papers???
t1_dtg7bf8	1	*	Does drinking acid feel good? depends on the person i guess but i would have to say no.
t1_dtg3qiz	1	*	Hope you like senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn.
t1_dth3x5y	1	*	Im a university educated millennial... 
t1_dtg5zt1	1	*	Mass immigration from poor Eastern European countries driving down wages, and an economy that is becoming increasingly centralized around London's financial market to the detriment of everyone else. 
t1_dtgajm1	1	*	Agreed
t1_dtg5q1v	1	*	older voters will hurt their country *especially* if it means possibly hurting foreigners and immigrants as well.  
t1_dtfzkqz	1	*	So this is how democracy dies: To the sound of thunderous retardation...
t1_dtgeo7o	0	*	No one has ever cared about the passport colour. It's just a joke people make. 
t1_dtgek45	1	*	Ouch, that one stung even all the way across the Pond.
t1_dthui6y	1	*	>The UK benefits massively from immigration just people don't understand.  Yeah, people lose their jobs because EU migrants can get paid less. Such benefit.
t1_dtg0cjn	1	*	I got that sneaking suspicion we're on Whose Line...
t1_dthunbk	0	*	>There's nothing binding about the referendum.  Except Parliament voted to ratify it. Twice. Get over yourself mate, you lost.
t1_dtgp8sd	1	*	That ship has sailed....and came back with some fellows with interesting views on women.
t1_dtg05sm	1	*	By the time the ports are de-iced, he will have been long dead.
t1_dtg2qwl	1	*	I'm still waiting to know if Trudeau met with the ethics commissioner 
t1_dtgidaf	1	*	That's a little extreme. A considerable amount of people are still stubbornly duped by the Tory old boys (Gove, IDS, Johnson, Farage) into thinking Brexit is going to be a roaring success.
t1_dtgcxr1	1	*	You can still get them, they haven't been made illegal.   Your supermarket just decided to not sell them. 
t1_dtg5mxv	0	*	that's literally every election ever. 
t1_dtgfsm3	1	*	How about the entire Tory party considering they should have been arrested years ago?
t1_dtg8wrk	1	*	The older generation knew what they voted for and the EU isn't it. They voted for better integration with the rest of the European continent, not to let in millions of Muslim refugees. 
t1_dtgbwtw	1	*	It's a really good demonstration of how the voting process is a joke and how the average person should have absolutely no say in meaningful large scale change.
t1_dtg298p	0	*	Actually your comment had me curious. Did some googling and the urban population percentages of scotland and england are pretty similar around 83%
t1_dtgcqto	1	*	Here are some car crashes

t1_dtgbcla	1	*	Don't attribute to malice what can be used explained by stupidity.
t1_dthhhlx	1	*	Probably, though I say that *very* grudgingly because a big part of the engine for growth is that your wealth is protected.
t1_dtgfeem	0	*	Man they gave you free first rate education then asked you to leave? Yeah what assholes /s
t1_dtg1noe	1	*	Young white europeans are breeding for a different reason than that.
t1_dtg4s8f	1	*	you can call them the most selfish generation or whatever but most narcissistic doesnt work lol
t1_dtgtcv1	0	*	So you don't think the main reasons weren't sovereignty and immigration?
t1_dtgzfli	0	*	China is also unconstrained by democracy / the media; and it also isn't constrained by some 19th century realpolitik view of the world.  In 50 years eastern Siberia will belong to China.
t1_dtgb2qi	1	*	I'm not a millennial, I'm one generation ahead. Still I think people like you are, what's wrong with the world.
t1_dtgicm5	1	*	This is the decade of feelings > facts
t1_dtg6ee8	1	*	Times are so soft we have turned anime characters in to body pillows.  But by the gods, are they soft.  ^*so ^soft*
t1_dtg6d7x	1	*	As a yank, I wish they'd get on with it, my popcorn is getting cold and I was told there would be fireworks.
t1_dtgckhw	1	*	Nobody really actually cared about the passports.
t1_dtgqdh2	1	*	NI is the only part of UK to have a border with another EU state. It's a whole new level of a clusterfuck for them. 
t1_dtfw1np	0	*	  Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.   Anonymous Greek Proverb  
t1_dtgez1x	0	*	There were Indian taxi drivers getting abuse in Welsh villages the day after the vote...it's disgusting. I try to laugh to stop myself feeling me dying inside..
t1_dtgkre8	1	*	lol Poland are probably the only nation in Europe that England like ATM. 
t1_dtgby2l	1	*	You are saying that you are indifferent between the two positions.  Yeah it is a valid position, but it is also an idiotic one unless you actually are indifferent between the two positions.
t1_dtg4gbh	1	*	It actually makes a lot of sense if you aren't so literal.  There is a difference b/w pop culture and civilizational culture.
t1_dtgc64z	0	*	He later admitted that if Remain had won by a similar margin he would have demanded a second referendum. 
t1_dtg5xvo	0	*	Yes, one of the worlds most economically powerful counties has nothing to offer.   /s 
t1_dtouctw	1	*	So take a look at your Fuhrer Paul Krugman and his moronic predictions. That guy is right as a broken clock.
t1_dtgfcpd	1	*	Plenty of other things to hate him for (his hypocrisy on fishing, for example), let's not give them the ammo to cry fake news...
t1_dtg7yub	1	*	> Putin is able to make his play on a poorer and more hateful world to benefit his ~~country~~ *oligarchs*.  
t1_dtghrd5	1	*	No, no it isn't at all.
t1_dtgcr3r	0	*	Made the right decision! You are foul.
t1_dtg72h2	1	*	The old cut off your nose to spite your face approach. Never fails.
t1_dtgbogz	0	*	Either way.  Still wrong.
t1_dtgy9xp	1	*	About as much as Bob from Brighton.
t1_dtgf0w2	1	*	Nah I'm not from t_d, but if you have a legitimate counter to his points say it, don't just say hurr durr punch urself in the dik
t1_dtg1p1r	1	*	And he ended up resigning ... bad move on his part
t1_dtgcgme	1	*	.... and hes gone
t1_dtgkb6e	1	*	Even if there were millions who didn't vote because they didn't think they needed to, it's no one's fault but their own for not voting. 
t1_dtg3ssx	0	*	A testimony of Whataburgers greatness, praise be upon it.
t1_dtgfllw	1	*	Except for all the opt-outs and limits available under those requirements that we didn't bother to use to limit the, perceived, negative impacts.
t1_dtfwdw7	0	*	Your response seems more reddit than his initial statement. What a shmuck. 
t1_dtg9mmt	0	*	This Russian Boogeyman thing just gets more and more ridiculous as time goes on. Brexit was Russia. Trump was Russia. The Russians made the dog throw up on the carpet. Oh muh gawd
t1_dumnmj9	1	*	But polish people are shit like all Slavs...  At sharing their delicious sausages.
t1_dtggejc	1	*	None of them are. Technically it would violate parliamentary sovereignty to make any referendum legally binding.
t1_dtg5utx	1	*	There's no big war, but by economic standards, these are hard times 
t1_dtga4xk	1	*	They called the second vote, not me... thats just how democracies work. People change, their will changes, nothing is set in stone. As soon as absolutism takes hold then democracy is done. 
t1_dtg5prl	0	*	Facts in and of themselves have never mattered. The problem of debate has always been the *interpretation* of *relevant* facts. That's where conflict arises.
t1_dth36rc	0	*	Well we clearly disagree but I think it's a bit unfair to lump a dictatorial mass-murder state-amalgamation together with a project that has arguably brought peace to Europe for 50 years. 
t1_dtg2zex	0	*	Unless it's the rock of Gibraltar! :D   ... I'll go away now
t1_dtg9vef	1	*	My generation are a bunch of lazy degenerates though, on the average.
t1_dtggxvi	0	*	It's a solid scheme as long as the demographic pyramid resembles an actual pyramid. Too bad it's turned on its head in many developed countries.

t1_dtmycg6	0	*	Not at all. pop culture news and gossip don't belong with actual news. That's why news organisations have a separate gossip/entertainment news section.

t1_dtvio40	1	*	Lol I know you're Vietnamese because of the username, but I'm Vietnamese-American and it's funny to me how you can make that same point about people in the US.
t1_dttsy6y	0	*	> US used to do it here too   We might start doing it again! Woo! No one has ever gotten rid of so many government regulations like trump! NO ONE! MAKE THE US DUMP AGAIN!
t1_dtu8q3k	0	*	You commented on an article you did not read. You blamed an American company for something a Taiwanese company and Vietnamese government did. Nice deflection.  
t1_dttvvsb	1	*	Power and privilege have equal and opposite effects. Can't have them without oppressing someone or somet thing. 
t1_dttsuy1	1	*	We're not killing the planet, the planet will be just fine after us, life will adapt. The issue is we're changing the environment so quickly *we* can't adapt and we're making it too hostile.
t1_dtu6cgr	1	*	Then they're not getting their message out successfully. If they were hurting a company's financial interests, they would be prosecuted. 
t1_dtv41ku	1	*	Climate change is a mainstream myth! Why would I even try to help the planet to begin with?! What has it done for me or my family?!
t1_dttu12j	1	*	Nah the planet has suffered worse than this, on a galactic timeline it'll recover quickly. Us on the other hand....not so much.
t1_dtw5ejf	1	*	Perhaps you should read up on Formosa Plastic and it's history with US investors before talking about America-centric narcissism. 
t1_dtvcswf	1	*	Never worried here. 
t1_dttxrlq	1	*	I believe the earth will be fine long after us. The universe has a strict set of laws it abides by. The earth will reset and continue about its way.
t1_dtur6tl	1	*	What do you propose?
t1_dttyiy8	0	*	The next one will be real socialism, I'm sure of it!
t1_dtty2pb	1	*	Or the dozens of J20 protesters who were rounded up and charged despite no evidence that they specifically took part in the rioting.
t1_dttyvxf	0	*	But why would you expect anyone to take the more expensive route?
t1_dtuazf4	1	*	What are you doing? Recycling???  
t1_dttu895	1	*	Yikes 
t1_dtucg81	1	*	Yes but the currency remains in the country and opportunity increases in the know how generated. Heck just the opportunity from the hardware that becomes available in the market makes it worth while.
t1_dttrjmi	0	*	I didnt say they were the same at all. Obviously they are not. I merely commented on how similar rhetoric is being used and that has given me pause.

t1_dtkd9fz	0	*	> However, in the not so distant future, that will be viewed as ancient history by most of humanity.  I don't think you have to wait long, even germans are getting sick of hearing about 6 millions.
t1_dtk1pv6	1	*	Many Arab countries ban films featuring Israeli or Jewish actors.
t1_dtkfs72	0	*	Yeah I'm sorry but there are beaches everywhere.   And I'm pretty sure New Zealanders don't need to travel to Israel to go swimming. Unless the idea of floating really easily appeals to them.

t1_du1dbyj	0	*	An how is this selim guy important or renown? 
t1_du2bs9e	1	*	No point in arguing with hate filled people that don't care about the facts and know little to nothing about history and believe to know all there is.
t1_duggb7l	1	*	I don't see how. I would think someone who genuinely believes 2+2=3 to be retarded too.
t1_dufjv3c	1	*	It was a tongue in cheek contraction of the guy I replied to. I know full well who practices this absurd tradition :(
t1_dw1f0a9	0	*	If there is any scar tissue it's so small I can't see it. And as I said, I've never had any problems down there.  I'm sure some people do if the procedure is done poorly, but all good here. 
t1_dufrq0x	1	*	I never said they were equally as damaging
t1_dugemdy	0	*	No, it really shouldn't, that's not at all natural, that is a result of permanent damage causing desensation of the glans.  Your body adapts but never recovers.
t1_dufllt5	1	*	Well at least at 18 21 u might have a say in the matter....
t1_dufalfc	1	*	If you werent circumcised, would you get it done now? From a religious dude with only a drop of wine as anesthesia? 
t1_duhv6pm	0	*	Sure, basement dweller.
t1_dugs47z	1	*	This is a rite of passage in some African cultures. Don't judge too quickly guys, not everyone thinks the same way as the west.
t1_dufhc25	1	*	Maybe your foreskin was tight enough to be confirmed phimosis 
t1_duh4w47	1	*	No, it's how circumcision actually works, but sometimes it isn't perfect. But not cracked, I meant keratinized.
t1_dugepgq	0	*	We get it. You prefer your men to be cut, you don't have to put anyone down.
t1_duh8v1u	1	*	Well, you failed, because you made a stupid, cliched point that is entirely invalid as an argument.
t1_dufmf1o	0	*	Those things arent equivalent but... Go for it. 
t1_dufpb2d	1	*	> 600   And lets assume half of it are women. Like seriously that is no sparta who cares about 300 dudes. Which also might be split on that issue.
t1_dug2kyv	1	*	I couldn't pull back my foreskin until I was 13 years old. Coincidentally that's when I started wanking so I'm not sure if the two are related.
t1_dufm5t2	0	*	Death-cultist atheists everywhere: Sacrificing unborn babies in favor of feeling better about themselves because they make retarded decisions and can't bear the consequences to their acts. 
t1_dui0ruz	1	*	Woosh.  I regret some of the teeth I had pulled as it causes ongoing issues. Being circumcised has caused me no issues whatsoever. Its such a non-issue.

t1_dsil50w	0	*	Well, I'd say that's still better than totally baseless speculation on vaccine safety, global warming, etc.
t1_dsii5vg	0	*	It would invalidate it if it was without merit. It's easy to see though that the American right is in a completely different reality than the rest of the world, which is very unfortunate.
t1_dsjce1f	0	*	I appreciate you at least acknowledging there's a problem on the left. The fact that shareblue links make the top spot on politics almost daily is a major issue.

t1_dsth84u	0	*	He never *hated* England, he just didn't spend much time in England, he never ever had any hatred to where he was reigning, and to suggest otherwise like OP has is laughable.
t1_dv1qytv	1	*	Capitalism is a bitch. Thatll happen. 
t1_dswwop4	1	*	> did they just pick that chant out of thin air?  hot air.
t1_duqs5e2	1	*	You mean 93 million?
t1_duqtzy9	1	*	> many states would have no federal say whatsoever  And how is that different to now? When was the last time Wyoming decided an election. State government don't deserve say, people do.
t1_duqyqgz	1	*	>shit their pant.  Already two steps ahead of you
t1_duqrg8w	0	*	Pale in comparison to Trump and his hookers.   But...those dont count, right?
t1_dur5ktk	1	*	Do you put two pants on when you get dreased?
t1_durm467	1	*	if she holds an interim it isn't her problem.
t1_duqsgm0	1	*	Gerrymandering was a pretty big factor, and some states have begun the process of throwing out congressional district lines as a result. 
t1_duro4ea	1	*	Just joshing, was bored af last night.
t1_duqz9te	0	*	Mmm, I would argue that the negative tone can be conveyed as it is. It implies that she doesn't belong there.
t1_duqyusr	0	*	Wow I'm convinced by your superior logic and reasoning there.
t1_duqrdov	0	*	At a federal level, I think so.
t1_duqp54b	0	*	Ironically this ends up making many individual votes moot. E.g., a liberal vote in Texas.
t1_durf7i6	1	*	I think it helps that her dad is rich
t1_dur3qca	1	*	;)
t1_dur6uy9	1	*	The US is just your average representative democracy with an old, broken system. It's big but nothing special in this regard.
t1_dur6d64	1	*	Agreed. Treating Government like a family business is one of the reasons the Revolutionary War began.
t1_dur2yv5	1	*	Are you discussing the role of mariage vs family here? 
t1_duqy0ph	0	*	>Or that Obama's kid is going to Harvard off merit?  Why do you assume she couldn't? Her mother graduated from both Harvard Law and Princeton.
t1_durirzg	1	*	He only has 5 (or is it 6) more bankruptcies than you and me combined.
t1_dur3cfb	1	*	I tried that, but all I got was a bout of depression and a huge mess of laundry to clean up.
t1_dusbn1b	1	*	I hope you do, too :) I mean, sadly our country's government still wants to emulate yours, so we NEED you to get better. 
t1_duqs708	0	*	I'd be impressed and want to learn more.
t1_ds6e9h6	1	*	Ahhh, the bibel defense. 
t1_dsth10d	0	*	Thank you! This is what you are all agreeing with. A full blown eugenic supporter. Youre advocating nazi ideals here people. 
t1_du7my82	0	*	Nope.  We're just going to straight up disagree here.  Hydrogen is a dead end for terrestrial transportation.  Unless you come up with hydrogen based fusion power, to charge batteries. 
t1_dswgtot	1	*	Why do voters in a democratic country have an opinion on a political issue they don't even begin to understand?
t1_dsvjsad	1	*	It would be funnier if he offered labour instead of money.  
t1_dsvrxvn	0	*	Except he's too fucking stupid to just shut up, this morning he tweeted that not only will it be an actual wall but Mexico will be paying for it. And his base eats up his lies with glee.
t1_dsupopd	0	*	Is... is this for real? IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN YOUR TAX DOLLARS GO STRAIGHT INTO TRUMPS POCKET HERE.
t1_dsutmfg	0	*	To then tout that opinion as equal to this opinion of experts is extremely dishonest, though. Not all opinions hold equal weight when making decisions.
t1_dsunjx8	1	*	Ahahahahahahaahah
t1_dsv0op7	1	*	So he didn't make a deal then ...? You're accepting that as factual?
t1_dsv3x3r	0	*	Or... you know.... Paypal
t1_dsw633j	0	*	Are they? His approval's in the toilet.
t1_dsupt6b	1	*	No he has business deals in dozens of corrupt countries where governments are happy to bribe him
t1_dsviag5	1	*	I imagine it will be the at least he tried something defense. 
t1_dsuyfk8	0	*	he takes more then a dollar, by law.
t1_dsweq2a	1	*	It seems like Trump was the only person who could maybe lose to Hillary, and Hillary was the only candidate who could lose Trump...yet thats where we ended up.  Amazing.  
t1_dti1qjl	1	*	You think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
t1_dv542qp	0	*	> is currently perpetrating genocide  can you prove it?
t1_duzo28p	1	*	Israel isnt an apartheid state. Only the surrounding Arab countries are.
t1_dtdqdiz	1	*	Maybe you should read the article you're commenting on jackass. What I stated is Russia's statement. 
t1_dtczw30	1	*	Please act on that then and leave the rest of us alone. 
t1_dtcn0m3	0	*	To be clear i wasn't arguing with you, i was asking...
t1_dtcyxwh	0	*	No the US sucks as well but thanks for your low effort whataboutism attempting to distract.
t1_dtcwboc	1	*	Goading was a negative is my point.
t1_dtejnm8	1	*	We would have to wait until he leaves office to see if he took anything won't we.
t1_dtd0pv8	1	*	Go spew your bullshit somewhere else
t1_dteg9ms	1	*	You can be dumb as fuck and still serve. I've known several with an IQ seemingly around that of a bag of really dumb rocks. It's not a high bar for entry.
t1_dv1rad4	0	*	Blame your parents then. As long as you don't infringe on our religious rights I honestly couldn't care less what the goy choose to do with their ding dongs.
t1_dv0egod	0	*	There is certainly a link between priest celibacy and the levels of child molesting. Even the Catholic Church starts to admit it and might reconsider their dogma on that point.
t1_duzmww0	1	*	Whatever you have to tell yourself, I see you already put me in some imaginary group...
t1_dsgk3js	1	*	It doesn't even need to be the breadwinner. Children and the elderly have also won their families cash for blood.
t1_dthal29	1	*	Heatpipes do not rely on gravity and work in any orientation. There are many commercial laptops on the ISS, all of which incorporate heat-pipes as standard design.
t1_dthjjlf	1	*	=/
t1_dst7r3a	1	*	Thanks for the words of encouragement
t1_dst9wzd	1	*	The most appropriate time (other than right now) to do something would be when Mueller submits his final findings and the House may be blue by that time.
t1_dst87vg	1	*	Well theres that but theres also the opposite - Streisand effect. 
t1_dsu4drq	1	*	That sounds ominous.
t1_dstc8p7	0	*	You joke, but were it not for kid-diddler I'm 100% certain he would have won.
t1_dstqvr0	0	*	Nice language. 
t1_dstt0v5	1	*	Interesting.  He does seem to aggressively effect change for what he believes is the betterment of the country.  As horrible as I feel saying this, yeah, he is a patriot...  Gross.
t1_dstbo4f	0	*	Why does that seem familiar 
t1_dstbo2i	0	*	I imagine he hired some of the top PIs from *The Internet Detective Agencyufe0f* 
t1_dsug5wh	0	*	Its because their experience with investigations is limited to domestic violence charges 
t1_dst3om7	1	*	You've got a good gut soldier
t1_dstibs8	0	*	Not really, several people he questioned said they just can't remember and walked. You can't detain without just cause and have no proof he truly forgot.
t1_dstazq3	1	*	The most important thing is that Doug Jones was sworn in about 2 weeks ago. He's a sitting Senator.  Moore can keep contesting all he wants. Doug Jones is Senator.
t1_dstb0yb	1	*	It was as easy as electing a Democrat in Alabama will ever be
t1_dspewsr	1	*	4-5% of the Danish population are Muslims. Not exactly being taken over..
t1_dspixzx	1	*	I get the impression I can't help you either. 
t1_dscsoci	0	*	I think it is more about the Olympics. Would rather talk with him keep things mellow for the Olympic games. But I may be wrong.
t1_dv315wn	0	*	Would you like some *champagin*
t1_dv3am3i	1	*	You'd only think that if you got all your news from Fox...
t1_dv34f8b	0	*	To me, the bullshit with the peace prize ruins the credibility of the organization. I expect corrupt results from it, and I don't trust it to be any better with the awards in any other field.
t1_dv446l7	1	*	Do you actually believe anyone with power is interested on cleaning anything anywhere anytime soon? You do know Santa Clause doesn't exist, do you?
t1_dv3las9	1	*	#FakeDrows
t1_dv35bwl	0	*	My mistake. Thank you.
t1_dv3zf4c	1	*	A couple hundred dead vs almost a million from the President before? Last I checked he wasn't awarded the prize for his work in drone strikes either.
t1_dv3im2n	1	*	Just like you, I'm no supporter of Trump, but that isn't a very positive way to talk about Trump supporters. I know they can be filled with hate and negativity, but they are still human.
t1_dv2xp7a	0	*	Nominated and receiving are two different things.
t1_dv373au	0	*	I'm sure if trump shows Baron the same amount of love his father showed him we will all be swimming in blood when it is Baron's turn in the throne.
t1_dv2x237	0	*	Asshole... its an asshole.
t1_dv2vht3	1	*	Don't forget the fake nobility implied by the name Barron von Drumpf
t1_dv3gvop	0	*	That's what I was thinking! Good episode. 
t1_dv43jg8	1	*	It's a conservative doing the false nomination
t1_dtjf81i	0	*	He made the claim so the burden of proof is on him.
t1_dtkzvhr	0	*	Only if they can force the other to pay
t1_dtjd2ls	0	*	well, usually people's argument of moving manufacturing back to US is about job creation, which won't happen
t1_dtih4fy	0	*	> Why would they increase the prices?  presumably the subsidy would end someday...
t1_dtim715	0	*	I like the dementia theory personally. Just has a disconnect with reality.
t1_dtjc2lx	0	*	If you make a claim, the onus is on you to provide proof of your claim. 
t1_dtiktzq	1	*	So its good to continue a bad idea? The more you know
t1_ds4s3yo	0	*	Because salty Israeli fans are equivalent to the Israeli government? 
t1_ds4p64w	1	*	Linked the wrong one... my bad
t1_dussk5v	1	*	Yes, the Conservative government of the UK are all secretly followers of Comrade Che.
t1_duto7k2	1	*	How can this be?! Now it's fixed. (Atleast I hope so)
t1_durwvt0	1	*	Thomas Muir.   His words as he did it Death to traitors. Britain First.   
t1_dsxii7v	1	*	>The people asking to have it released are not in a position to declassify the memo  Bullshit. Trump could declassify is immediately.
t1_dsxnr4h	1	*	Let's start with the DNC and the RNC and work our way down. The news is killing me; they sound like monkeys flinging shit at each other.
t1_dsyfjy0	1	*	So you are saying it's a win win situation for the US arms sector.
t1_dsycpd1	1	*	Turkey has had NATO membership for over 65 years.
t1_dsz8zvd	1	*	They don't work.

t1_duzzqkk	0	*	Significantly (infinitely) more than is required of a private citizen. 
t1_duzx88h	0	*	They just raised it to $11, and have plans to raise it to $15 by 2020.  http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/11/news/companies/walmart-minimum-wage-increase/index.html
t1_duzxcz1	1	*	Thanks. Innocent mistake, but it would be more helpful if you just explained the misunderstanding. Future reference.
t1_duzy8lq	1	*	You how many rifle murders per year? About 375. How many pokemon in the current gen? About 802.  Isn't it clear what we should be focusing on?
t1_ds8h6y7	0	*	That's funny, because yours is weaker. If a cop kills someone innocent in the US he gets a promotion. If a cop kills an innocent in Sweden, he gets fired and prosecuted.
t1_dt2b12r	1	*	It's a religious clash with Buddhism even the Buddhist monks are sick of this shit.
t1_dszg2dv	1	*	Stupid science bitches
t1_dsz2mw4	1	*	Lol at red state 
t1_dsz6wfz	0	*	Yea, maybe stupid isn't the right word... but I don't know. At what point can we expect people to not get blindly influenced by what random people are spamming?

t1_dszdwd3	0	*	The media has become a self licking ice cream cone.  Half of the news is literally citing what other news organizations are reporting.  
t1_dsytet5	1	*	You'll get no argument from me there. 
t1_dszhq7z	1	*	Different projects backed my the same people's money.
t1_dsqh423	1	*	Bitcoin miners also get compensated directly for running your transactions. There are fees.
t1_dsrzta3	1	*	Bottom won't fall out until there are no more coins to mine. I assume there is cap on them right? 
t1_dt6r4er	0	*	This type of behavior is what gave us Trump and all these right wing extremists. 
t1_dt6zuxw	0	*	Cheers mate, I learned all this in French and struggle with a lot of the translation. 
t1_dt8jq8e	1	*	Eh, I'm still failing to see how even Uruguay legalizing it was world changing. Canada won't be different.  But if it's good business for you then I can see how you think that way.
t1_dt6i4z2	1	*	Ever heard of [The Double Irish?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement)
t1_dt71yyy	1	*	Yea the bottom 70% covers a lot of middle class. 
t1_dt6yz0i	1	*	No. Out of the G20, the US has the highest statutory and 4th highest effective corporate tax rates.   Source https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52419
t1_dt6zae4	1	*	So accelerate the third worldization of the US?
t1_dt773yx	1	*	I've found there are two kinds of conservatives in canada. Pro-oil (at the expense of all else) and just pro-business in general. 
t1_dt717wh	1	*	TIL governments build economies.
t1_dt71lrv	0	*	New Brunswick doesn't hit 53% (rounded from 52.5%) until you make  $3.95 million.
t1_dt6xrae	1	*	Well. There is Still an investigation, the left knows that he is corrupt. The thing that needs to happen is that he gets punishment for it.
t1_dt763sp	1	*	Dont forget global defense as a service.
t1_dt6xvs7	0	*	That still doesnt take it to 53%.  Highest Federal rate is 32% on all income over $229000. The highest provincial tax rate takes that to a around 47%
t1_dt6jykv	0	*	Everyone else did it is not a valid excuse when you campaign on righting the wrongs of the past with specific action items.       https://trudeaumetre.polimeter.org      Sort by Indigenous.

t1_dt68vg9	0	*	> At least the cons can govern competently.   I was with you until this drivel.
t1_dt72nao	0	*	The U.S. Navy also makes sure international trade and shipping is safe. The entire world benefits from it. 
t1_dt6zfrv	1	*	No need to get angry. We're just talking tax policy
t1_dt80opd	0	*	I've got enough points on their system to move. If shit turns south I for sure will move
t1_dt75vk7	0	*	I'm sure Canada would just grant asylum to 3 million people. 
t1_dt7n275	1	*	I don't see how supporting business  and being a strong leader is are conservative traits. Liberals should want a strong leader and economy as well.
t1_dt71486	0	*	Uh no, it's a well known fact that it's harder to immigrate to Canada than the US. This is agreed upon by even most liberals that I know. 
t1_dt6zlvf	0	*	I think hes more talking about the fact that Canadas military piggybacks on the US and wouldnt be able to do anything globally without a call to the states
t1_dt7oj7h	1	*	It's pretty bad, but it was also already bad.   I get free coffee at work so I don't really go there anymore, which Is nice.
t1_dt7dp8z	1	*	No, I have seen just what I described. 
t1_dt6timk	1	*	Tax Avoidance would be more accurate. Tax Evasion is illegal.
t1_dt7biw1	1	*	I just write off any pay increase as PR moves
t1_dt6uutc	0	*	again. Show me where it says financial compensation.   Hint : It doesnt. Ever.   At most it mentions a remedy. We allowed him back in the country a free man. More then he ever deserved. 
t1_dt7603n	0	*	I mean I was annoyed at that too, but if you let 1 broken promise be enough to distrust a politician despite all the other good things they do, you will never find a politician you like.
t1_du1n6fu	1	*	> I'm just deep browsing.  Do you not see how creepy that sounds and actually is to be doing a Saturday..
t1_dt75om8	1	*	Plus their food is fucking gross.
t1_dt73j7j	0	*	50% marginal (tax on next dollar) but you're looking at more like 30-35% effective  (total tax divided by gross income)
t1_dt6zevy	1	*	We've got the Bernie Bro quoting Bernieisms 
t1_dt729rm	1	*	While Australian Liberals are centre-right with a large faction of full right (and one or two extreme right).

t1_dt73m1x	1	*	I guess so...
t1_dt72pt3	0	*	so fuck poor people as long as you can get high?
t1_dt80ly1	1	*	> Then he said I'm a tax cheat  This isn't accurate.  
t1_dt6zgai	1	*	Still no. The highest MARGINAL tax rate in Canada is 53% in some of the eastern provinces. That is only on income above 200k. The actual amount you pay in taxes is still far lower than 50%.
t1_dt7l2n0	1	*	Yea thats your opinion... 
t1_dt76n7n	0	*	Yeah! Who needs infrastructure, emergency services, etc, etc... or any government at all for that matter  ^/s
t1_dt734ew	0	*	Agreed, let's have a simplified... **and** high tax [*corporate*, not *sales*, critical distinction] rate then! Until things actually improve.
t1_dt77z50	1	*	Problem is too many people already made up their minds on the issue and would blow a fuse on any politician with any economic/accounting/finance experience that proposes it. 
t1_dt7tgir	0	*	Thats because of tax shelters and loopholes. In the US at least, the rich are required to pay more than anybody else.
t1_dt6ojc8	0	*	Yes, but they are increasingly given the choice between the two because the politics are so polarized.
t1_dt6sw76	0	*	They did have national health care....
t1_dt6pf3x	0	*	So that means that the nazis weren't nationalists? What are you trying to say?

t1_dt6ua0m	1	*	The German Army is replacing their G36s. Surplus will do, no?
t1_dt6phls	0	*	No bearing in your life. I didn't say it had no bearing for lives overseas. 
t1_dt71edb	1	*	ah, well could even be the Mossad trying to get more citizens 
t1_dt6stg7	1	*	Didn't say that. I'm just commenting on my perception of reddit's personality seeming to change very quickly. Wondering if there's something to it or not. Last time I noticed it, there was. 
t1_dt6kjvl	1	*	Sorry then
t1_dt6wtol	0	*	Its the one piece of survival gear that can get you food, water, and security. If civil unrest increases and SHTF its going to play a pivotal role in your survival. 
t1_dt6xgz4	1	*	No, it states if the migration rates go at these rates it's 20%
t1_dt6qnlq	0	*	Refugees didn't create Nazis, Nazis made themselves so.
t1_dt9n851	0	*	Well, right wing isnt automatically national-socailism. Its not black and white. There are many*many* shades of grey.

t1_dte7b6n	0	*	Don't let the perfect be the enemy if the good
t1_dspkbt3	1	*	Or that education is almost completely funded at the state level and by local property tax. Education is a states right, so blaming the president is to overlook many more influential factors. 
t1_dspjf5r	1	*	It's almost as if the article is about another western country...
t1_dspma3s	0	*	Nurses complain about their three shifts a week. How about the resident doctors working 110 hours a week with 4 days off a month on a $50K a year salary?   
t1_dsqnx5z	0	*	Doctors and programmers get paid more. Why would anyone be stupid enough to be a teacher?
t1_dtku5am	1	*	No they're not. It's because gangs have no other weapons handy, and guns and knives over a certain length are illegal here. Whereas you can hide acid in a pop bottle.
t1_dtkylux	1	*	So youd rather be shot in the head and killed, then have burns but still live?  You should ask the victims of acid attacks if they still want to be alive.
t1_dtnpa5b	1	*	Probably something that's absolutely and unequivocally guaranteed to kill whatever is on its way.
t1_dssap0o	0	*	LOL, they ARE Snopes or Politifact.   And no, of course I wouldn't believe anything coming out of those 2.
t1_dupfo2c	1	*	Yes, it's far simpler to just go with the sane solution of Adding more guns to the mix will not solve gun violence, gun safe or not. 
t1_dupe2qo	1	*	I would if Mercs just weren't a way to get around certain restrictions on the US military. 
t1_dupew6e	1	*	I'd contribute to that.  I'd contribute so hard.
t1_dupmsuv	1	*	Fair enough. Yet they *represent* those manufucturers (and users), and they lobby politicians to maximize the gun market and gun use. 
t1_duq58j4	0	*	Not as bad as FN Herstal securing a contract to sell P90s instead.
t1_dupd96g	1	*	Only the ones that make rockets, bombs, and guns
t1_dupchct	0	*	At least they'll be trained in firearms for that Walmart job when they get out.
t1_dupa691	1	*	We often see brainy detectives on TV like Sherlock Holmes, but I bet most detectives are more about hard work and doing your homework. The basics of investigation and learning from experience.
t1_dup275g	0	*	Wow. Youre so right. Ukraine *should* give Crimea back to the Turks, since it was taken with force and all. 
t1_dsvnm4y	1	*	And? Vassal state South Korea can exist without enforcing will on neighboring countries. 
t1_du7ggj9	1	*	Is it 20% of CO2 emissions and 5% of population?
t1_du7voqj	1	*	Also, the US is a long way ahead in cumulative damage from the last century, upon which much of their wealth was built.
t1_du4o5of	1	*	About as close as this particular Russian could get.
t1_du4heev	1	*	This would only happen with agreement with the other partners and is being looked at as a possible option to keep the ISS after the 2024 date for it to be decommissioned and then deorbited.
t1_du4ube1	0	*	Are you serious? Air travel and space exploration are not even close to similar. 
t1_du553u0	0	*	Which is fair enough in most cases, but there is the rare thing worth reading. 
t1_du4psmp	1	*	NASA has become highly politicized, leading to bureaucrats becoming more important than the engineers. 
t1_du3kzkk	0	*	No. Everyone doesn't like him.
t1_du5o2qh	0	*	While Trump definitely doesn't represent all white Americans, he was the first successful presidential candidate to run on white identity politics.
t1_dsigvck	1	*	that's a misnomer since hiring j-tru we're not sorry we're sexy 
t1_dskcgwn	1	*	Most of the time when someone is leaning on a shovel, it's because they're waiting for some specialist to do their thing before they can get back to work. Not everyone is trained to do everything.
t1_dsjzxjp	0	*	Which one?  The kneeling guy or the guy who got swatted and killed even though the cops had no idea if he was a hostage or not?
t1_dsjr154	0	*	I didn't expect the spanish inquisition 
t1_dtc7r9j	1	*	Shining too brightly in your brown eye?  It's called a comedic schtick. If there's an overarching theme that applies in all sorts of irreverent ways, it typically works.
t1_dtqh2ha	1	*	Yea human life. What a waste, am I right?
t1_dttaev4	0	*	Yep now much safer than it was 5 years ago can't say that about the economy though

t1_dupo7ms	0	*	Both numbers are high. But 1 in 5 **raped** includes a totally different quality of 'misbehaviour' (both is condamnable, but rape is something way more serious).

t1_dtscvte	1	*	> non-controversial  You spelled wrong wrong. 
t1_dtqj2g1	1	*	Japan didn't take our terms of surrender before the bomb. The didn't take it after the first bomb either. Where are you getting your information?
t1_dtq8nek	0	*	You still haven't justified your response though... Im fairly certain everyone knows the horrors of the bombs... That doesn't mean their use wasn't justified though.
t1_dtr5fve	0	*	In a vacuum. You can grow crops in greenhouses with lights. Also, plants don't grow in 30 percent sunlight? That's still a lot of light. Even 1 percent light is very much like daylight.

t1_dujlrqc	1	*	I think I'm going to be sick. 
t1_duj7r7u	1	*	If religious people want to rip the still beating hearts of their enemies on top of a stepped pyramid you need to respect that.  Nope, their rights stop where those of others begin.

t1_du65rme	1	*	You want to list the conflicts in the last 25 years they've instigated rather than backed the USA up on?  EDIT: Yeah, didn't think so because you can't, bucko. Nice try next time.

t1_duk2kn8	0	*	How does one unfairly squeeze out competitors without use of the law?

t1_dv4ajfh	0	*	That's what everyone does with their presidency. Government is the great fiction, through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.
t1_ds58zln	1	*	Not worse either. 
t1_dtw9qj7	1	*	I'll bet they're not telling us about any societal norms, customs, or traditions that would be obnoxious to a progressive westerner.

t1_dsrfyql	0	*	It's only that way if you sign up for this insanity. You can just decide to live modesty and not be such a moneygrubber.
t1_dsrm42o	1	*	its about the greater fool.

t1_dt8b45c	0	*	>and was expected to get another extension to 2028.  Sometimes our expectations don't come true. No one expected Trump to win, but here we are. 
t1_dt7rabo	1	*	It seems to all be partisan politics these days no matter what outlet you goto. Really makes me hate the entire political system and the media that cultivates it.
t1_dt7xtq3	1	*	Russia says a lot of things and doesn't follow through. I agree, chances of them maintaining a station of significant size after the ISS is gone is very little.

t1_dsmcmjp	1	*	Wait so you are saying they took money and actually did charitable things with it? How infuriating.
t1_dsml0ti	0	*	Right but an immigration talk is about immigrants. Not the country they're from. Calling the countries shitholes when discussing their people is a crap thing to do.
t1_dsmhmop	0	*	Prove it.  edit: holy shit it's legitimately amazing what you morons consider proof. Go to college. If you already did, get a refund.

t1_dsmkfxt	0	*	Just like the 30 years of Hollywood conspiring to protect Weinstein. 
t1_dsmb4v6	0	*	Its the same people committing the crimes and making the policy. That is the inevitable direction that society takes when wealth inequality reaches extremes. Money and political power go hand in hand.
t1_dsmd1su	0	*	What? 
t1_dsmfhw6	1	*	Well, clean $95m minus the initial $41m cost. Still, though, $54m is a pretty baller come-up as far as now-its-clean money goes. 
t1_dsmdg67	1	*	They get a bad name because a different part of their organization makes lists or something, but as far as I can tell, they are trying to do journalism seriously.
t1_dsmkn3q	0	*	The allegations about the Clinton foundation revolve around the 2011 international earthquake relief effort.  It's best to at least learn your opponents arguments before dismissing them out of hand.
t1_dsmyhs2	1	*	Plus the Swiss offer discounted rates if you pay in gold teeth. 
t1_dsmequ5	1	*	You are literally describing opinion pieces... thats what theyre there for. You can fact check any of their standard articles and it checks out. This is delusional.
t1_dsmex29	1	*	We'll see
t1_dsmd4an	1	*	We should look at people who keep money in off shore bank accounts as criminals the same way we place blanket judgement over classes of people like muslims.  
t1_dsmneji	1	*	Yes, but did he use bleach when he laundered the money?
t1_dsmhieq	0	*	Please give example of a company or person who offer such services. Would like to interview them... for science.

t1_dtrwsr2	0	*	No, a total lack of competition is often not the best thing. You still need some kind of non-public competition keeping the public option honest.
t1_dtrg27n	0	*	aus eye exams are free, i think every 2 years
t1_ds4io9s	1	*	Most of these refugees come from either HTS occupied areas or Assad government areas. Not just ISIS. Those two have big powers backing (USA, Russia and to a lesser extent KSA and Iran)
t1_dsouasg	0	*	I'm saying that the sanctions sound good to the public in the USA, but in practical terms don't harm anyone with US political connections.

t1_dt3sh8a	1	*	You're pretty much proving that person's point. A person won't exist in your life if they don't participate in Facebook.  You're probably missing out.
t1_dt2kffe	0	*	 The cash component involved in elevating a point of view as related to pushing an agenda is not something I really thought much on. Thanks for pointing this out.

t1_dujk9rh	1	*	Rightly so lol. Can you read?
t1_dujwccp	0	*	The SS was not the only group that helped run the camps. 
t1_dumfrk2	0	*	When I support things it's because Im educated, when other people do though it must be because they're brainwashed!

t1_dunb1rx	0	*	It's probably the same sad person using both accounts.
t1_dum01ro	0	*	The largest minorities in Israel are Arabs, Russian Jews, Bedouins, and Druze. I wouldn't refer to either of them as Nazis.
t1_dt56vsu	1	*	Kind of like Trump vs Hillary. 
t1_dt5j9er	0	*	I don't think the US plans to export their reserves. Canada has some pretty big oil reserves it's looking to export, hence the pipeline to the pacific that bypasses the United States 
t1_dt5929g	1	*	local milk people*
t1_dt51qrg	1	*	Yeah, thankfully the CRTC isn't just a political football.
t1_dt59wnr	1	*	That looks to be an old copy, because the US is still in that one.
t1_dt5q50g	0	*	No. The new TPP has more environmental protection as compromise (Canada was pushing for it).
t1_dt578j6	0	*	Canada produces real cheese...
t1_dt525ot	1	*	*clutches pearls*
t1_dt57qbw	0	*	Havent you noticed that the corporations are the government? 
t1_dt56c97	1	*	Thats because Trump fakes the numbers. Obamas numbers were real. 
t1_dt560xt	0	*	You're years behind on the tech stuff. There has been a huge influx of American companies *into* Canada over the past couple years. Toronto alone added 220,000 tech jobs over the past 12 months.

t1_dt4qtk4	0	*	Whos decreased trade with us?
t1_dt4v9k3	0	*	as long as you take Ted Cruz
t1_dt5eiju	1	*	Congress could have authorized it before Trump took office.  It was already dead, because Congress wouldn't approve it, before he was ever sworn.
t1_dt5puyy	0	*	If you still use the word retarded, you're either a teenager or a moron. Either way, shut the fuck up.
t1_dt5o6hk	1	*	Oh bullshit they dont. 
t1_dt5mm6s	1	*	I'm completely aware of what intellectual property is, but even if I didnt there's no reason to be rude and condescending about it
t1_dt5ihav	0	*	Most of the cost of bottled water is the bottle and transport to where you buy it.  If you want 10,000 tonnes of dirt, it'll cost you even though dirt itself is basically free.
t1_dt5nmz1	1	*	Not an argument
t1_dt5dfkj	0	*	> At the same time they are mad at China for making fake knockoffs of their favorite games.   Totally not angry about this, actually.

t1_dt5gqbz	0	*	No, it shouldn't be something we praise him for.  Congress killed TPP and Trump's opposition to it was for all the wrong reasons. Just like his opposition to NAFTA is for all the wrong reasons.
t1_dt5q5uq	1	*	Lol, the whole point of tpp is to counter china...
t1_dt6b5yt	1	*	Trump is like a slow-motion self-destruct button. They're going to have a lot to repair once he's gone.
t1_dt59dmz	1	*	I live in Arizona. Only cold here is Scottsdales attitudes. 
t1_dt6at8n	1	*	Nope, another day of our God Emperor running shit and telling all the liberal filth around the world to get fucked!! Life is gooood!
t1_dt50e5a	0	*	Which is why, when adjusted for inflation, median household income is about the same today as it was in 1990? Reaganomics was the biggest lie sold to our country in its entire history. 
t1_dt55hyw	0	*	How long until his term ends? He could sport a bourbon and coke in Nova Scotia all day in his retirement.
t1_dt5c8v9	1	*	I wouldn't go that far, but he clearly made the right choice on TPP.
t1_dt4kp87	1	*	You can't argue facts regarding the GOP if it paints any kind of positivism. Do you not get that? 
t1_dt51lds	0	*	Countries like Canada, New Zealand or Australia already have strong environmental protections. Other TPP countries like Vietnam or Malaysia have now to step up their game.
t1_dt57rwz	0	*	No, but he promised to do more to respect and represent first nations, who were very adamantly against this pipeline.
t1_dt55yxi	1	*	Da!
t1_dt5czsr	0	*	Why do people keep playing this card?  No one is claiming reddit has a mathematically precise hive mind.  But voting in articles shows the general trends in beliefs.
t1_dt5c6xa	1	*	Perhaps relatively but the closer you look the starker the picture.
t1_dt5fgk3	1	*	It feels like 1984
t1_dt5bsjv	1	*	This is an important is disturbing point.
t1_dt69wtz	1	*	Yeah except there is also a provision for the US to change their mind and join in later on and all the things they wanted would just be slipped in there and forced on everyone with no choice. 
t1_dt5806d	0	*	Europeans and Australians make fun of us for our watery milk and dairy :( 
t1_dt57t99	1	*	Most of the IP stuff was suspended.  Some ISDS things were watered down.  More worker and environmental protections were added.
t1_dt59jv6	1	*	He was being sarcastic my dude.  Also based on his comment history he's a total dickhead.
t1_dt5grvv	1	*	Excuses. No president is able to fulfill every campaign promises. Not even your god emperor.  
t1_dt5dxxs	0	*	Idk.  If 70% of the country is meh on proportional representation, is it needed?    There are bigger problems right now like the crazy orange dotard to the south.  
t1_dt5oy6n	0	*	Other jobs exist.  No, wages will not fall significantly.
t1_dt55qcb	0	*	Mexico is fucked, but Canada can fall back onto the Canada-US FTA.
t1_dt59qzr	1	*	Lol, mostly right other than being wrong on 3 of his 4 points?
t1_dt5q9ni	1	*	All of which would have benefited the US... But we don't win anymore, right?
t1_dt5802k	1	*	Indeed.ca
t1_dt5n5cv	1	*	Realize that a do nothing president will obviously accomplish things that require doing nothing.
t1_dt5agxe	0	*	What Pokemon you got?
t1_dt5h4y9	0	*	No, the international mega-corps that were involved in writing the TPP.
t1_dt4ycuu	1	*	We cannot fail under this very stable genius. 
t1_dt4tiiy	0	*	This is not the TPP. This is an agreement built from the ashes of it. Nowhere near the level of secrecy. 
t1_dt4zyv6	0	*	I voted green, personally.
t1_dt5lq3t	1	*	Uhhh, what?  
t1_dt5ptaz	1	*	Yeah, but expert economists aren't allowed to look at it, either.
t1_dt6j9tk	1	*	Canadians are sad wannabe Americans 
t1_dt5fdx6	0	*	Time? Forbes? The guardian?   Those sources are perfectly fine. Also Joseph Stiglitz is a nobel prize winner for his economics. I think those are pretty good sources.
t1_dt5qf7a	1	*	Example? 
t1_dt5tqb7	0	*	They have a leader that's working for them, we have one that's working against us 
t1_dt4v41i	1	*	It will be no different than it is now. 
t1_dt5lc3y	0	*	Absolutely! All countries should take care of themselves first. If we dont learn to do that, we will fail.

t1_dt4y7jm	1	*	Regina's mighty shores!

t1_dsyn0n6	1	*	Ah I was ignorant thanks for correcting me.
t1_dszbis6	1	*	Congrats you have just witnessed the morphed reality formed by unbrindled nationalism that is springing up in India .
t1_dt0iytj	1	*	 that's correct. However, those 'islands ' Are not chibese territory
t1_dsztt7v	1	*	Also reminds me of the people who insist on standing right in front of the food plates at the party.
t1_duzm8g8	1	*	Social harmony votes. 
t1_dsdj3n8	0	*	You don't even know how to write his name. It's Macron, not Macon. 
t1_duk2vuu	0	*	You can say the same for any brand of extremism.  Extremists suck, most people from any group are decent
t1_dsvbgi7	0	*	I thought we were mostly uninvolved in Pakistan
t1_dtrtevr	1	*	Yeah. Makes sense now
t1_dub9ysw	1	*	Huh, TIL. Thanks.
t1_dubthdm	1	*	That wouldn't lead to a dismal prognosis though. 
t1_dsdbw7e	0	*	The subreddit decided to upvote it, though.
t1_ds8vd0b	0	*	> Not state approved. Only A rogue scientist.  Yeah right. A rogue scientist who received presidential pardon and the highest civilian honour of Pakistan by the state. That too twice.
t1_ds8jnad	1	*	Exactly - Not to forget how US conveniently left Afghanistan after the end of the Russian occupation.
t1_duzykof	0	*	reference to 1984 I think, in that book the population believes they have always been at war with east asia even though reasons arent given
t1_dugs6ds	1	*	I just got back to Canada from visiting the US for a couple of weeks and honestly NBCs coverage of the Winter Olympics is embarrassing to what CBC and Bell media offer. 
t1_ds837kf	1	*	Because.... I don't know. Hard truths don't get a lot of uptime on the old hivemind box I guess.
t1_ds7c0ac	0	*	>mass cabbage  They're all about that grass roots support base aren't they
t1_ds735ug	0	*	Just like all liberal protesters are paid by George Soros
t1_ds7dgze	0	*	No, I'm saying that due to the lack of indigenous north Americans in other places, it's typically not explicitly  included in the initials.  In the same way that hijra typically aren't. 
t1_dskk9t4	0	*	I'm sorry they don't let you go on reddit at your menial job. Perhaps you should have finished high school. If you had, you may have known that Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are allies.
t1_ds4kik8	1	*	Well the only thing the Indo doesn't say, which **is** an important fact, is that he was specifically asked by reporters about it. It wasn't unprompted.
t1_duodu1f	0	*	It's really not clear as day. When I watched it the first time I thought the guy charging the police was an IDF soldier. It looked like he was wearing Mitznefet and everything. 
t1_duocn3y	1	*	lol. Thats really my name 
t1_dunjdpn	0	*	Well there is video footage of him charging them with an object, and of the soldier shooting in his direction.
t1_dsxwevz	1	*	Nope.  Not me.  Later alligator.
t1_dszchot	1	*	Yeah, this is something that a lot of liberals don't want to hear so they won't be waken up from their utopic PYD/SDF dreams.
t1_dt07fnt	1	*	> main opposition party of Turkey  The one that wants to take islands from Greece?
t1_dsyw3t9	0	*	thats far fetched dude. turkey is only interested in the parts where YPG controls.
t1_du4mnyj	0	*	The article said bought for 41 million not that it was only worth that much
t1_du4lgq0	0	*	Why do you think it was only worth 40 million? The fact that Trump sold it for 95 million and then a few years later it was sold for even more suggests the purchase price was the real worth. 
t1_du4i09l	1	*	Dotard is its own word not a portmanteau. 
t1_du5ny84	1	*	Moron-nonsense cake maybe. 
t1_du4m9gj	1	*	I have not had that experience in the vast majority of non-political subs I follow.

t1_du4jk0a	1	*	I can believe you can triple your money by bulldozing and subdividing, but after the local high end market crashed?
t1_du4kq18	1	*	For Russians, it could have been really useful base of operations and would scare the shit out of US/Canada to have Russian landmass so close to home.
t1_du4n4fc	1	*	One is a solved problem, the other you have to get creative with. 
t1_du4m4ii	0	*	Wow impeachment anyday now. This shit doesn't hold in court, at best it's circumstantial evidence at worst it's fake. Anonymous sources mean literally nothing in a court and for good reason.
t1_du4re7d	1	*	Imagine how different the cold war would have been if the USSR had territory in N America. Tensions were bad enough; maybe that would have tipped the scales. Maybe Seward prevented WWIII.
t1_du4nht8	1	*	also true.
t1_du4jtc3	0	*	Thats my secret, CIC.... Im always Justice. 
t1_du4jgdq	1	*	That doesn't mean anything.
t1_du4q71v	1	*	Not if he is willingly ignorant, which seems to be the case.
t1_du4k2qj	1	*	Hahaha, buying land at 3 acres per dollar a waste of money.
t1_du4n2e4	0	*	Wow, nice gish gallop. A list of 1000000000 claims of which only a handful carry any weight at all is not any evidence.
t1_du4j3u3	1	*	Imagine how different the previous cold war would have been if the Russians could install missile silos there.  It's one thing to blockade Cuba, it's another to blockade Alaska.
t1_du4h8zo	1	*	OHHHHH i get it!
t1_du4i86n	1	*	Worth the price in gold and fish
t1_du51ovw	0	*	Your example is wrong.  The correct one would be...... everyone that makes $160k becomes a millionaire or everyone I k ow who made less than $90k became millionaires.

t1_du4xrqe	0	*	So youre glossing over it and writing it off because its negative coverage of trump. How is that better? How does that prove its falsified information? Because NPR has a strong track record. 
t1_du5ainm	1	*	>Being indebted to foreign powers is also a pretty major violation of the emoluments clause of the Constituation.  How he is indented ? He sold estate not took credit

t1_du4p2pe	0	*	So you aren't actually interested in proof then. Got it.
t1_du4rf7o	1	*	Or Seward's Icebox
t1_du4ukvw	1	*	Sure, but then why did the Russian oligarch pay 2.5x the market value and just tear it down?
t1_du4kdkm	0	*	I think Trump is wicked smart
t1_du4kjyq	1	*	Yes
t1_du4leqm	1	*	Because Trump's vocabulary is so small, and his speech patterns are so predictable that anybody over the age of 7 can believably imitate him.
t1_du4hpyf	0	*	Sure he did, how do you think the Russians got it?
t1_du4ifu6	0	*	As another attorney, Im shocked how many people hop on here and start making bold claims about the law. Thanks for taking the time to correct a misconception. 
t1_du4oaws	1	*	Yep, one wrong step with the Kremlin (the oligarch's clubhouse) and you are convicted for tax fraud, all of your assets are seized and you spend the rest of your life in prison.
t1_du5n8o7	1	*	jesus, that URL title...
t1_du4runp	0	*	You would know ;)
t1_du4pisk	0	*	How so?  It looks to me like a simple profit.  OTOH - HRC and BHO have a lot of explaining to do about a litany of crimes that will shortly be uncovered. They will likely end up in prison.
t1_du4jlem	0	*	Wow that sounds so plausible you DEFINITELY convinced me, nothing to see here move along folks!
t1_du4rxzj	0	*	Why hard cash in the middle of the night?
t1_du4wnxv	0	*	The real kicker here being that the proxy is the president.
t1_du4itid	1	*	Basically. But (i think) the authorities will know that the transaction was shady and will probably ask the other guy where he got the money.
t1_du4jv6i	1	*	There's a reason a lot of FBI agents are accountants. 
t1_du4p1ks	0	*	Its just really weirdly phrased and an all round childish response. No, you're the ... would usually be heard in an elementary school, and be followed by something like butthead.
t1_du4kj6j	1	*	It's been brought out a few times over the last year as well.
t1_du4g8sg	0	*	Wait will $50 make it the correct answer?
t1_du4kwh2	1	*	shuck it, Trebek.  
t1_du4ks1h	1	*	He also certainly wasnt the only asset to be groomed...
t1_du4k9r8	1	*	I meant normal business. Being versed in criminal skills is a must have though - most of those connections required are more or less connected to mob, including the political ones.
t1_du4q60d	0	*	Look over your head. See that tiny speck? Yeah, that's the joke. You must have missed it.
t1_du4kgwk	1	*	That's because shortsightedness is a symptom of being a politician.
t1_du4jnsu	1	*	lol, seriously? This is like money laundering 101...

t1_du4iei3	0	*	Je Suis Alaskan. 
t1_du5bw26	0	*	It's also done to provide anonymity to high networth individuals in a completely legitimate and legal way. It's a red flag for money laundering but it's not actually criminal.

t1_du4hpwm	0	*	Are you going to provide *any* sort of argument or intelligent response or just use childish insults? 
t1_du4lqk0	0	*	My now ex fiancxe9 is the great great Grandaughter of William Seward who approved the purchase on 08/01/1867. Fun little fact. 
t1_du4v42c	1	*	The KGB explicitly states this. Foundations of Geopolitics is a long road-map (along with being KGB/FSB required reading) 
t1_du4tmyn	0	*	I see. The article is poorly worded as to which sale was being referenced, and the 2005 date is not in this article at all. 
t1_du4kcn8	1	*	No, both of them. Trump made $60m on the deal - they don't give that away for free.
t1_du507o5	0	*	Yep and that oligarch can then sell that house later for the $40 million price or more depending on the market. Having a legitimate 40 million is better than an illegitimate 100.
t1_du4ye4g	1	*	It's like people should held accountable for massive crimes, as though the president is somehow to be held to a higher standard than a petty mob boss.

t1_dt92wa7	1	*	Why don't you go work on qualifying yourself for a better job? With a little planning you could easily have a $70k or so salary in a few years.
t1_dtgkboj	1	*	But he wants to see what YOU present so that he can pigeon-hole you into some stupid argument..
t1_dtfzii5	1	*	wtf haha?

t1_dt72w2w	1	*	I don't know the specific figures here either yet, but in order to be held to account, they have to have had a dominant market share.
t1_dt6uhi5	1	*	The Phenom II's were great for the price.
t1_dt72j4i	1	*	The 2019 European Parliament election.
t1_du77rng	1	*	Yes, because otherwise it's, as I said, an inane hypothetical. If your argument has no basis in reality, there's no point in addressing it. 
t1_dsgupew	1	*	Lol no I didn't but I get that you need to say so.
t1_dtxn2l1	1	*	How is it even a debate? A bill passed, but he just said: no. And isn't going to do it.
t1_dtwft1b	0	*	I think you're wrong on Trump not having the mental acuity. We're all being played. I think he knows exactly what he's done, what he's doing, and why (Whatever that may be.).
t1_dtw6g3h	1	*	Maybe you should take a look in the mirror every once in a while.
t1_dtxdjw5	1	*	I wasn't saying something for or against the bill. Just that I remember obama vetoed it and it was near unanimous which made people suddenly begin asking why would he do that.
t1_dtx6md8	1	*	Rebellious phase. He got over it. 
t1_dtxly15	0	*	Why is it even being debated? Is it because a corrupt senate could then bring charges against a non-corrupt president?

t1_dtw97nt	1	*	As an outsider I actually don't understand you Trump supporters, you're literally dividing your country and blaming it on the other side. Outrageous, but hilarious all the same. 
t1_dtwh7xk	0	*	Saying Hillary lost because she is unlikeable is accurate but disingenuous. The election was close enough that we can point at a number of different factors and say Hillary lost because of [BLANK]
t1_dtwh6jt	1	*	Honestly the whole thing is so ridiculous that I cant tell if you are joking or not.
t1_dtxtpna	0	*	Glad youve gathered that. Please correct me now.
t1_dtw0qq9	1	*	Maybe internally, but on a global scale Trump is much more damaging than anything the democrats can come up with.

t1_dv27bb2	1	*	Thanks for clearing that up! I just didn't understand what you were saying very well.
t1_dv1puw7	1	*	There being a legal basis for it doesn't mean it isn't fucking stupid though.  His point is that it's dumb, not that the charge is or isn't legal.
t1_dv0rzi4	0	*	He wouldn't be charged for it and shouldn't be.  It is free speech here in the US.  While if McConnell did that I would support anything that would force him to resign or not get re elected. 
t1_dv12pdk	0	*	For any action discussed in this topic, or just because you couldnt contain sharing an irrelevant negative opinion?
t1_dv0nsgt	0	*	I meant to clarify that I mean modern/current terrorism. I'm well aware that left wing violence certainly existed in large amounts previous to the past few decades.
t1_dv0ro6q	0	*	Link?       Hmm getting thrown in jail for saying offensive things or freaking out over a breast on TV. Hmmm which is worse

t1_dtukvfo	0	*	If I had to guess, it's because people are okay with being underpaid. They are accomplishing something pretty massive. I'd be surprised if most didn't factor that into their pay.
t1_dtuk3k5	1	*	Not even lying when I read the comment I replied to I thought it said advertisements
t1_dtvfys8	1	*	They've been working at this since 2013??  I don't think I ever even heard of SpaceX until like 2015. I guess I was just under a rock at the time.
t1_dtv0ddp	1	*	Damned Bugs!
t1_dtwonnn	1	*	While fascinating (at least to me), it's hardly the same.    Find a 'lost' civilisation/go to a place no human has ever been **vs.** see a variation of something/place that has already been seen.
t1_dtvstw0	1	*	There's no I in a .... never mind.
t1_dtvt3e5	1	*	I've seen people complain that it feels icky to watch a Silicon Valley publicity stunt, and or it's a giant advertisement for Tesla.  It's hip to hate anything high tech to some people.

t1_dtusbs0	0	*	Jesus remember to wipe your chin off.
t1_dtvcffy	1	*	No, the falcon 9 cant carry nearly the payload, and can only throw to LEO.  The GTO capacity of the Heavy is MUCH greater.

t1_dsxs5w8	1	*	Good thing we elected Donald Trump, that bastion of honesty and integrity /s
t1_dscg5hz	0	*	Maybe you are not old enough to understand but people have to travel for work. Fortunately the laws are lenient. I assume you never send sensitive info over email? 
t1_dsho0fi	1	*	Wow I can believe the downvotes youre getting. 
t1_dshppc2	1	*	I know a few Russians, they're just like anyone else on an individual level. It's guys like Putin and his cronies who are fucking it up for the rest of us.
t1_dshki04	1	*	America claims to be the world's most moral and good country standing for truth and justice, with unquestionable motives; Russia does not.

t1_dshu9ew	0	*	Because meddling in some third world country most people can't point to on a map is way less interesting than meddling in the country with the most powerful economy and military.

t1_dshyocr	1	*	Our nukes will free you, your nukes will free us.
t1_dshrz1d	1	*	It's funny because that's exactly what happened within the LNP once they got elected.

t1_dshs11w	1	*	Yup no russian influence here: /r/metacanada
t1_dshqydo	1	*	Because the internet is full of people who don't read, except for social media on the internet.
t1_dshwoqw	1	*	As a gay American, I'm going to go out on a limb and say there are still some key human rights issues that will separate us from the general Russian populace for at least a couple generations. 
t1_dshqg8o	1	*	Because the US news media knows anything Russia and meddling related will draw views/clicks. 
t1_dshqogq	1	*	Well then I have unspurprising news for you, buddy.
t1_dshpbcl	1	*	This is beautiful.  I want to live in a world where all the citizens are untied against their governments.  Then hopefully we'll all finally get to just be people without all the ridiculous division.

t1_dshv2iu	1	*	What we really need is something like a working class revolution, that may work. ^^/s
t1_dshvehq	1	*	Did Russia ever had people's government? I mean first vikings then Mongolians then Monarchy with absolute power then Communist party, and now they have autocracy with Putin.

t1_dshr2u5	1	*	That's a perfectly awful joke.
t1_dshhdg7	1	*	So by your own admission the United States is complicit. Election interference: what goes around comes around.

t1_dshnhk3	1	*	Oh completely. How many non-combatant civilians has Russia murdered in the last two decades via false flag again?
t1_dshtjjs	1	*	Except I've actually seen people here calling to bomb the fuck out of russia with thousands of upvotes, so yeah.
t1_dshrb8b	1	*	They absolutely do. Sure there's only one person on the ballot and if you don't vote or try to write someone else in you disappear. But they still go to the polls to vote in their elections

t1_du473uf	0	*	In socialist society, critisism of the government is encouraged, so I only know of people being shut down when they are forming a counter revolution.
t1_du431uz	0	*	Nobody gets too far like that. 
t1_du45s2l	1	*	no damnit - Trump's fault!   EVERYTHING is Trump's fault!!!!!!

t1_dumrk8s	1	*	So what you're saying is that I don't need to be qualified to use a gun too? Gotcha!
t1_dumthhx	1	*	You wasted a lot of words pretending that weapons manufacturers aren't a part of the military-industrial complex. 
t1_duyjrti	0	*	All those innocent people killed by drones are just par for the course, huh? I like how your litmus test is didn't start another huge war, as if maintaining the status quo is some sort of achievement.
t1_du3gee8	1	*	Best for Britain is demanding that we stay in the EU, they're quite open about it.
t1_du49yd0	1	*	I know thats what hes referring to. My point was that this wasnt an EU vote and isnt an EU issue, this is 100% on the UK.
t1_du323e2	1	*	His script doesn't handle this situation.
t1_du3j1pw	1	*	Good luck with this endeavour, worked so well in the past.
t1_dufun92	1	*	I will look into it. Thanks for the starting point.
t1_du3j4y6	0	*	Thats not necessarily true. You can have publically financed elections, like we have in Ireland. You'll obviously never fully remove money from politics with this, but its a pretty good system. 
t1_du3b8w2	0	*	> I only see people upset with money in politics when it's left wing groups getting money.  Really?  Did you miss the entire Bernie Sanders campaign?

t1_dsac0dv	0	*	Felony collusion isn't a thing so...  Lying to investigators would show intent to cover up what they knew was illegal activity involving Russian operatives. But you'll ignore that anyway. 
t1_dsaa3vq	0	*	You seem like a radical
t1_dsdc6v8	0	*	Like I said, no underlying crime. Lying to the FBI is a crime, but they're not lying about another crime. its literally pulling a Bill Clinton impeachment.
t1_dsal9yx	0	*	Bots are only there to throw shit and derail the discussion, not to actually engage in it.
t1_dsai072	1	*	Real easy for you to overlook the indictments and guilty pleas I see. 
t1_dsan8go	0	*	I'm struggling to think of what dirt was dug up on the democrats too. Certainly not enough to indict Clinton, Obama, or anyone in their administration...

t1_duhjvd4	1	*	Your ahistorical perspective is clear for all to see. The enlightenment is the basis of modern western civilization. Deal with it.
t1_dujctif	0	*	Sorry to brust your bubble, but you understand jack shit if you do comments like that.
t1_duhm41e	0	*	But surely that applies to all kinds of religion not just Islam.
t1_dui1hb5	1	*	Atrocities can be justified by any belief system, including rationalism and humanism. We've seen that during the 19th and 20th centuries. 
t1_duhj1b4	1	*	You get off reddit, Russkie. 
t1_duhmobl	1	*	True, maybe I should have put it as  fundamentalist/extremists. 
t1_duhn4fa	1	*	It still has a LONG way to go yet. Returning to Christianity now is not the answer. The answer is to reject Christianity as much as Islam and move on.
t1_ds7kfc2	1	*	Not all rebels are ISIS, that's a different matter.
t1_ds7o70j	0	*	Yes because the IDF has a policy that they treat anybody who comes to their hospitals regardless of allegiance.

t1_ds4xjro	1	*	Why would you guess that when he specifically said rubber bullets and tear gas?
t1_ds585zt	0	*	The left is just as guilty of this.   Look throughout history and this tactic has been used as long as politics have been around.
t1_ds4rxrz	1	*	Dispersal orders are unconstitutional. First amendment rights.
t1_ds4tefp	1	*	Of course, swing and a miss on the shooting they got outraged over, and then the narrative of if the shooting was right or wrong overshadowed all the other issues with the PD and courts in that area.
t1_ds4rx3q	1	*	Yeah forget Chechnya, the political assassinations, the massive propaganda machine that is RT and the well documented disruption of democracies in both Europe and America.
t1_ds4ogf0	1	*	Non-police people shooting each other?
t1_ds55cfy	1	*	Yup. I remember in my city it was mostly people in tents doing drugs, and when I went down there I could barely get over the smell and left after 15 minutes. 
t1_ds5qo2a	0	*	Serious question: which part of the constitution is it that you dislike, or the parts that you feel are wrong/should be changed?
t1_ds5sixw	0	*	that's pretty awesome how you can just deny basic terminology and real concepts, and decide you will just construct your own ignorant alternative reality, and think you still matter 
t1_ds533jk	1	*	Bingo
t1_ds57mk4	1	*	Trump won because Hillary didn't reach out to the working class the way Trump did.  Thats why Bernie Sanders was vital  and the democrats fucked up.

t1_ds4qgfm	1	*	Who makes laws in this country?  Does the country have a history of whites leveraging the legitimacy of the state and it's security forces against the black community?
t1_ds4qi18	0	*	The biggest demonstration was 1.500 people. The entire country, haha. Sorry but demonstrations in 2009 were hundred times bigger.
t1_ds4s5c9	1	*	No, it IS wrong. Not only is it not true, even if it was that doesn't excuse them. 
t1_ds544pm	1	*	There was never a financial crisis in the USSR because it's not a crisis if it's all the time. 
t1_ds53d5p	0	*	> a world with the US as superpower is still far better  Tell this to Libya. Do they live better now? With slavery?  US only cares about US and feeds off other countries. 
t1_ds4tab1	0	*	and US government doesn't use it?

t1_ds4qebi	1	*	Well said. 
t1_ds4rp6k	0	*	Yeah, but size matters. We are the preachy asshats who shove our values on everyone else and claim exceptionalism but then treat a decent percentage of our own population like shit
t1_ds4sk4k	1	*	>not to vandalize private/public property and steal shit.  You do if you're black and (college age) liberals are in charge.

t1_ds4uhc6	1	*	That just says what the book is about. The book has nothing to do with the Russian government and is considered a joke. I have no idea why redditors have such a hard on for it
t1_ds4v546	1	*	I think the outrage isn't about the frequency that it happens, but the impunity of the perpetrators. 
t1_ds4y844	1	*	And what solutions are those?
t1_ds4s7dc	1	*	Imperialist.  Look that word up.  Which American war goals line up with an Imperialist agenda?  Stupid is a more valid criticism than Imperialist.
t1_ds4pldq	0	*	Exactly the point

t1_ds4q0vz	1	*	It's a little sad that I know of this primarily through Gangs of New York and not from my expensive education. 
t1_ds560pm	1	*	It depends on the instance in question.
t1_ds54i70	0	*	I would argue that the Iranian Islamist regime deserves to be overthrown. Since that can't be done peacefully in their system of government, then violence is the only solution.

t1_ds4ta06	0	*	No, he's saying the riot is bogus because the cop turned out to be right. I'm saying the shooting alone didn't trigger the riot, therefore the riot was not without reason.

t1_dt6gk4i	1	*	How about that post when the dossier came out and they flagged it something like Unverified source. It's the fucking conspiracy subreddit!
t1_dt671ix	1	*	Its purposeful and targeted. Maybe its better to trust the actual media rather than the comments on Reddit.
t1_dt616an	1	*	The action of this story is still rising. I'm expecting a crazy climax.  Maybe trial by combat with Mueller versus Trump?

t1_dt7nmms	1	*	He replaced Comey with McCabe, but now McCabe is having doubts about Trump. Especially since McCabe had the same loyalty spiel given to him by Trump.  It's unlikely that McCabe would fire Mueller. 
t1_dt605xi	1	*	No. If Russia could get away with influencing the presidential election, it would help their case that the US government and democracy is weak.
t1_dt74v9q	0	*	Yes, we're just like North Korea. You can tell because we can talk about it without being punished.  Go back to Russia, troll. Nobody cares what you have to say.

t1_dt6imtl	1	*	If its in violation of long standing US law, like from agents of a foreign government, then no

t1_dsgv1be	0	*	I would say that the limit should be more closely in line with where the US has set it. Unless the speech directly incites physical violence or murder on a person or group, it should be allowed.

t1_dszaem6	1	*	Lol, thanks for the rebuttal.
t1_dsyjl7z	1	*	It's a bit better than you make it sound, since charitable donations can reduce provincial income tax as well. For Albertans the combined credit is 50% on donations beyond $200.
t1_dsxcfj6	0	*	Only legal because they buy the politicians for pennies on the dollar they'd be spending on taxes.
t1_dsxbdoe	0	*	I think it's morally wrong to allow welfare & food stamp recipients to buy cigarettes, alcohol, and junk food, too, but no one's ever going to do anything about that, either. 
t1_dsy7cnl	0	*	Nearly half of all workers pay zero net income taxes.

t1_dtel6fv	0	*	I dunno what that acronym means though?
t1_dtew5y3	0	*	Is that actually true ? And what would satelites tell you but here is a facility ? The US has enough problems locating North-Korean sites related to their nuclear program. 
t1_dtv5jvl	0	*	Do they exist in Australian/Russian soil? Cause if the market is open, eventually more producers will set up shop.
t1_dsv2i3o	1	*	As is welfare spending - eg living on government assistance for a while until finding a job, then paying the state back in income tax
t1_dstuj59	1	*	***L O L***  Who needs to pay for cirkus tickets when you have the internet
t1_dsuczm0	0	*	Egalitarianism is an egalitarian movement, feminism acts on the presupposition that women are oppressed which is an idea closely related to dialectical materialism.

t1_dtwi8jk	1	*	Because she's most guilty of being an accidental whistleblower in this case, and her power is a lot more significant than most whistleblowers.
t1_dtwvm2m	0	*	If human rights is what spurred us, we would be intervening in Myanmar right now. 
t1_dtw1h3z	1	*	Who has called Dresden a humanitarian intervention? It was a war and Dresden a military target. The allies went into it on those grounds, not humanitarian ones. 
t1_dv1ue1p	1	*	I didn't say it was a good idea.
t1_ds3xu9o	1	*	Brown snakes will chase you too. Those fuckers are mean.
t1_ds3h5d4	1	*	Actually, throughout history, most slaves were not black. Basically every group of people who ever existed were enslaved at one point or another.

t1_ds3908j	0	*	A dark tunnel segmented away from the police improves safety?
t1_du928f8	0	*	Yup, Russia/Soviets are always the victim defending themselves. You gotta feel bad for them.

t1_dsc8kf8	1	*	Ohhh, I see.   And yeah, true. I see that. 
t1_duclm1u	1	*	Exactly, unless they have some kind of backdoor installed on that VPN server there is usually no way to know where the actual traffic was from.
t1_ds44qgx	0	*	No need to write a book. Fact is, this news source is too unreliable. It has published too many mistakes and outright lies to be taken seriously.

t1_dt11p8f	0	*	To call what happened an attack or even a verbal assault is beyond stretching the definitions of those words. He was heckled at worst. Like a comedian is on stage.

t1_dubxi0f	1	*	It's more that everything is already written but the page you are currently on is the Now Time you are experiencing. 
t1_dshotfl	1	*	What will effect of this on the U.S. economy? I imagine it will basically force us to be a lot more stringent on our debt and how we treat it, however I'm not near educated enough on this topic.
t1_dshfdxu	1	*	Yes.
t1_dsh5765	0	*	At some point in history? Sure. I guess we can speculate at some point? Imminently like some Redditors are foaming at the mouth for? Nah. Not going to be the case.

t1_dtvdiso	0	*	That's the point they don't answer to Lebanon, they answer to Iran and Lebanon has no control over them
t1_duqlh7y	0	*	Because a nuclear winter would just make the area colder and even less prone to flooding than it already is. 
t1_duqu5ja	1	*	Natural law and order is what gave us that ability. 
t1_duqtt7k	0	*	Yeah, the one in Norway. Frozen island. Zombies just can't make it there.
t1_duqo10o	1	*	That's the end result they want, but they would maintain a library of seeds in their original variety for various reasons.
t1_dur4efg	1	*	I see what you did there
t1_dsbk3o4	1	*	You're right, good spot. thanks 
t1_dsl9m8n	1	*	It's not about racism, holy shit.  Christ literally talked about how rich people won't get into heaven.
t1_dsl9o0r	0	*	Which Christian Bale are we talking about here though?  Machinist Christian Bale, The Dark Knight Christian Bale, or Backseat Christian Bale?
t1_dsl9my1	1	*	The poor oppressed white Christians.

t1_dv2412g	0	*	Cars were designed to kill? Guess I have been doing it wrong for some time now. 
t1_dv1oqhg	1	*	It's an assault rifle or it's not.  This argument boils down to: It looks scary.  These firearms aren't assault rifles in the way that matters; the way they work.
t1_dv1iwtd	0	*	If it has plastic it's military.  If it's wood it isn't?  This is silly.

t1_dsvabke	0	*	That clears it up perfectly :P
t1_dswhb42	0	*	I wouldn't advise you testing it out.
t1_dsvux8i	0	*	Thank you. This is the logical end to any major war and should be avoided at all costs. If spending less on military is the way to get there then it is a win/win.

t1_dtssg0e	0	*	So, they aid and negotiate with terrorists then?
t1_dtsjmga	1	*	So you're saying you and Abbas know better than the Palistinean population as a whole? That democracy needs to be suspended because the government knows better than the people? Nice try, fascist.

t1_dtizu37	1	*	Naive is thinking that you can reason with fascists which sums up the Taliban quite nicely. How do you think fascists should be dealt with?

t1_ds7lb11	1	*	I can't deny we love to put the peddle to the meddle.
t1_dt8h86v	1	*	Because we don't like things to get worse, stepping back in time is something we don't like in Britain. We're not use to it, and it pisses us off.

t1_dtcz64v	1	*	Youre right
t1_dtd57am	0	*	??? How am i complaining about people generalizing israelis generalizes palestinians? You made a leap so huge you went around the world and back.

t1_du3lblc	1	*	Most vegans support their children, or even encourage them if they want to eat meat. If they don't, they're just bad parents. 
t1_du2j7e3	0	*	Aka they don't like religion, so they want to ban it in public or restrict its practice.

t1_ds8plen	1	*	That's just stooping to the same low as the Fox network and such. I really hate that. 
t1_dt25q0s	1	*	That's a better way of wording what you meant because only fit people with a high tolerance for shitty working conditions can do this job, not just anyone

t1_dsbm8qy	0	*	You lost legitimacy, and I stopped reading, when 100% constitutional links to what an inadmissible alien is
t1_dsb3mw1	0	*	the middle class is only getting a bonus in certain states and will be paying more in others where they now get doubled taxed.
t1_dsb1b28	0	*	also the wall was or is idk suppose go into the ground to prevent tunnels
t1_dsb0nyg	0	*	Also, a system that was put in place *specifically* to prevent a Trumpian-level catastrophe being elected as POTUS.
t1_dsbj8cc	1	*	Trump still does it.  More than a year after being elected, he STILL tweets about Crooked Hillary.  How anyone can overlook such transparent distraction is beyond me. 
t1_dsaze8v	1	*	I just imagine his mouth as a sphincter, and everything that flows from it as the skids. 
t1_dsb0rsi	0	*	So he is totally wrong because you can quote one person who disagrees? A sign of Trumpian times indeed. 
t1_dsb7rl9	0	*	The rest of the world has a great track record of sticking up for the finer points of economic relations between a superpower and some random country.

t1_dsb6fgu	1	*	> and all she kept saying was, trump sucks, and im not trump  Which was enough for any person of normal intelligence to vote for her.
t1_dsb45ew	1	*	So you're telling me he's creating jobs?  Thus solving the problem once and for all.  ONCE AND FOR ALL!
t1_dsb3o9e	1	*	So how did the corporate cuts manage to get permanent?
t1_dsb3adf	1	*	Ok well not the new car part.  But the vast majority of illegals do come by plane or simply through a legal crossing and never leaving. 
t1_dsb79e0	0	*	And keep out titans.
t1_dsbbc4y	1	*	Shit. I had no idea that was Ron howard that narrated. I'm watching that right now and as soon as I saw your comment, it clicked. 
t1_dsb0f3w	1	*	Thankfully I don't take that poison, I mean contraceptive. 
t1_dsbguqf	0	*	So spend it on research idiot. Or should we spend more on tanks, warships, planes and bombs that we will never have a good reason to use?
t1_dsbad42	0	*	Yeah and if you were a teacher you'd understand how wrong you are.   Lemme see, lemme see oh ok: Class sizes.   
t1_dsbpm44	1	*	It takes two to tango.

t1_dsb9rb2	1	*	Mande?
t1_dsb6q8v	0	*	That's wrong.  It's only against Argentina.  US is far more nationalistic than latin America. For example, we don't have gigantic flags on every corner (which is not bad).. 
t1_dsblaw0	1	*	The debate for both sides is pretty hot, still.  A random redditor summed up the pro side succinctly.  
t1_dsb0f0j	1	*	It's a [con game](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/17/news/economy/middle-class-senate-tax-bill/index.html) my friend
t1_dsbgunc	0	*	Originally that's why it was criminalized.  But now it's a new (potential) revenue stream.
t1_dsbiqdg	1	*	Who knew being the president would be so difficult.  Literally everyone.
t1_dsb2rof	0	*	And a tonne of ways to reduce corporate taxes, all the while the common person is stuck with hoping that their tax reductions are extended by the next congress.
t1_dsb45xf	1	*	Flavor-aid, ok?
t1_dsb7jwt	1	*	If he isn't that stupid, he is just evil. And people prefer to live with a stupid president for a short while instead of gettin called supporters  of evil.
t1_dsbqdb7	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_California_High-Speed_Rail  Oh look your lying. 
t1_dsb53ej	1	*	They got the tax bill, and at the end of the day they care about that way more than they care about Obamacare
t1_dsb2w64	0	*	no true at all  the blue states did not get a tax cut they will now be taxed double. it was a vindictive plan.
t1_dsb21ig	1	*	Maybe we can get Trump to Tweet that its time to start eating those Tide packets. 
t1_dsbbsg9	1	*	Another lame sarcastic response. 
t1_dsb97pq	0	*	Oh yes assuming southerners are retards will surely win you allies  MAGA
t1_dsb4y3r	1	*	Their media doesn't cover the personal tax cuts sunsetting, or the huge hole in the deficit these cuts for the wealthy will leave.   Voila, problem solved! 
t1_dsb1eay	0	*	The kool aide could be labeled poison and theyd still drink it.
t1_dsawnd9	1	*	Don't go to any one media outlet, they're all shit trying to create hysteria. Wakey wakey
t1_dsbqn0m	1	*	And still, [most of the states with more heroin overdose deaths are conservative states](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/heroin.html).   *man, those dumb liberal drug addicts in Georgia!*  /s
t1_dsb3nrq	1	*	Im confused. Your source's income distribution is within 4% of each side, but I dont see anything about welfare.
t1_dsb9p6i	1	*	True. Congress deserves a lot of the credit as well for actually passing the legislation.

t1_duk1ixs	0	*	He's saying he wants you to die. 
t1_dujg208	0	*	The point still stands. If even one example is proven to be untrue the mouth breathers will start screaming fake news. Its better to come in with a complete list of facts so you dont open that up. 
t1_dupxdyd	1	*	Well its that... otherwise the country will starve from currency inflation. How do you otherswise fix a shit situation. No one trusts the government anyway already

t1_dtxlr6x	1	*	A teaboo, if you will. 
t1_dty8u62	0	*	pjr is right. I prefer canzuk myself. But the array of issues brought by the EU have turned a lot of people off freedom of movement entirely.
t1_dty78ho	1	*	Interestingly, I was looking at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyse_Doucet) last night. The Chief Correspondent at BBC! 
t1_dtxdvo9	0	*	America. Saying that Americans would understand if Canada wanted us to pay for a wall. We'd probably start a gofundme. 
t1_dtxrv57	1	*	What about things like acid attacks, which don't qualify as terror attacks? I'd also take into account the pro-ISIS protests that took place a couple years ago.
t1_dtyft10	0	*	Both of your comments are so ill-informed it's terrifying. 
t1_dtxh1yl	1	*	> Fix your country, then you can immigrate to ours  I'm Canadian...   Also, I've never had anything but a pleasant experience in the USA or in interacting with Americans.

t1_dtxh6dk	0	*	How do they taste?
t1_dtxz0lx	1	*	All commonwealth countries have QEII as monarch. That's not really a social norm.  What social norms do they share.
t1_dtxq54e	0	*	Having a link is good and normal.  Desiring to keep other people out who are not similar is racism masked as nationalism.
t1_dtxy693	1	*	It should trigger elections in the american system too. If you cant keep the government open, its time to go.
t1_dtx6k34	1	*	Neeeeeerd

t1_dtxg8uv	1	*	Its very roughly $2 to the xa3 and things are much more expensive in Australia
t1_dtxci3d	1	*	You speak on the phone or skype a lot, and you love each other a lot for it to work. You meet up when you can. Then, hopefully, at some point one of the two moves to the other. It's pretty common.
t1_dvxy8io	1	*	Hangin around with the kid that's obsessed with guns through the angst
t1_dtxh09o	1	*	Delusional.

t1_dty04s8	1	*	Huh. You learn something every day.

t1_duwijc1	1	*	Ahhh.. so its only the evil bad Russia killing people. Cool, just wanted to make sure.  I mean those saintly rebels have never broken cease fire and brokered deals before have they?
t1_dsyo8bf	1	*	Thank you! That was very informative. 
t1_dsx5an1	0	*	I have heard Americans say this same thing before but other than making yourself look stupid for saying it I could never understand what point you/they were trying to make.
t1_dswrj32	0	*	So you're all for the next government removing the funding from other groups they oppose. This is exactly what point I am arguing. 
t1_dswwohl	0	*	No, we are not. Argentina likely is. We have very little in common with Europe.
t1_dswkt02	0	*	By denying them the finding that other orgs get.
t1_dsxo7a3	1	*	You're waaaay off.  Any time a foreigner from Europe, Asia, or even South America says the word Americans, they're referring to people living the USA.
t1_dswqprb	0	*	I'm not sure that's true, but I can't say I'm knowledgeable enough to be sure.
t1_dswjli8	1	*	No, they're actively not subsidizing religious beliefs, which seems appropriate for a government
t1_dsxa9pc	0	*	I think you're missing the point though - she is saying trudeau is out of touch with americans.... who have nothing to do with trudeau and electing him etc etc.
t1_dsxibf5	0	*	What are you even trying to say here buddy?
t1_dsxa228	1	*	Could easily argue that pregnancy from a broken condom or slightly ineffective birth control is also against the will of the person. 
t1_dswxv9p	0	*	Look what youve gone and done, embarrassed yourself in front of the entire internet 
t1_dswtcev	0	*	*factual evidence is given against claim*  Yeah, no.  *audience cheers*
t1_dswtdin	1	*	Not nearly as much as the safe-space that is t_d 
t1_dswz32o	1	*	but they aren't, they're a political group.  I don't think you understand the concept of church and state. What, next you tell me that the church should be taxed?
t1_dswz9us	1	*	Yes, they absolutely are. Some even in the third trimester.  Do you genuinely believe they don't? What rock do you live under.
t1_dsx1k58	1	*	Most people draw the line at the actual FETUS part, which is why most abortions take place during the advanced zygote stage. You aren't killing a baby, you're removing a cluster of cells.
t1_dsxb20r	1	*	> I would at least be able to take the pro choice side seriously if they didn't revel in and celebrate all this infanticide.  Source?
t1_dswxfi4	0	*	It's not someone's money, it's taxpayer money which should go for every citizen. Not just the ones the government likes.
t1_dswkhip	0	*	Except that's what these groups were doing, paying students to handout anti-abortion pamphlets and protest clinics.
t1_dsx3tgq	1	*	You obviously didn't read my comment. Bye.
t1_dswn3rs	1	*	I just love the controversial section of reddit comments.
t1_dsxmr00	1	*	So you'd be OK with paying an Imam to spout anti-Jewish propaganda then?
t1_dsx22e6	1	*	No because if we solved the problem that caused the need for abortion we would eliminate an emotional issue that people are able to fight over. 
t1_dswqfne	0	*	Yup. Supreme Court set precedent on this in 1988 when it indicated that laws criminalizing abortion violated Section 7. 
t1_dswrk7n	0	*	Your problem is that you don't understand that freedom of speech and belief do not cover beliefs that ~~negatively impact others~~ I don't agree with.
t1_dsww0m2	1	*	What if the general public voted to kick all the Muslims out?
t1_dswscsu	1	*	Link?
t1_dswmmu9	1	*	You should post it!
t1_dswt44g	0	*	The it'll happen anyways argument is dumb. Murders and robbery happen even with laws, that doesnt mean that they should be legalized.
t1_dswrc9a	0	*	and those individuals then having their own children
t1_dswyktk	0	*	If you love waiting months to see a doctor,  giving half your money to the government and funding abortions, yea it's great. 
t1_dsws6j7	0	*	At least in america, its definitely not a priority in the leading pro-life parts of government
t1_dswofy0	1	*	Yes. Americans are actually already dead.

t1_dswmwdk	1	*	Some individual conservative MPs tried to reopen the issue with a private member's bill but Harper shut it down swiftly.
t1_dswm5ed	0	*	Very much this.   I remember a politician last year said that he thought abortions should be safe, legal and rare.     Sums up my opinion pretty nicely
t1_dswoqaf	0	*	I don't have retarded opinions. Fuck anti abortion people. I approve of this law. 
t1_dsxi1fq	0	*	I guess there are no true Scotsmen. 
t1_dswp3uv	0	*	Being that the legality of abortion is included in the Canadian Health Act, it is policy. Dont act like because you support the *policy* that it isnt a *policy*.
t1_dsx0cpn	0	*	He said if we call people's actions barbaric they won't be willing to sit down and have a dialogue, he never once said honour killings aren't barbaric.

t1_dsww7kt	1	*	Wat?
t1_dsyk4w6	0	*	What's not great about it then? It shouldn't be covering all your costs, it's a supplement.
t1_dswpisy	0	*	Does jacking off not kill millions of kids? Is it a travesty every time a woman goes un-impregnanted for her period to come around? 
t1_dswonz5	0	*	That's not what's happening. It's, You can get money if you support the country's laws and the Charter and don't if you advocate for taking away other people's freedoms.
t1_dsx0ul9	0	*	So presumably you'd be in favor of the govt doing this for anti gun protestors too right? 
t1_dsx1qlv	1	*	well if you aren't 24 yet, you can hope that this period will be extended again, next year.
t1_dswoylf	1	*	No, I get it, I just think that viewpoint is stupid and un-empathetic 
t1_dsx4pch	0	*	What is wrong with showing people the harsh reality of abortion? If it disgusts you so much you should understand why people don't like it. 
t1_dsxpybv	1	*	No way, you didn't offend me personally! I just can't stand when people misunderstand me, my life story haha. Cause then it's like, oh crap, the basis of their judgements isn't even true. (Ego!)
t1_dswqsls	0	*	I don't think that's true. I mean, up to this point anti-abortion groups have been getting funding for summer jobs and there's been no Charter challenge.
t1_dswt2rl	1	*	Especially priests....
t1_dswoeqp	1	*	And does that actually make the group fill up, or is it just 3 pedos and the priest sitting in a room ?
t1_dsx4pyp	1	*	'go suck a lemon' nice one.
t1_dswnu20	0	*	wow you have enlightened me thank you oh wise sage in these hundred comments I made in this thread you have illuminated a typo please become my copy editor senpai

t1_dsxqlv5	1	*	I have never met a person who is opposed to abortion for anything other than religious reasons. 
t1_dswt9f1	1	*	If men had to give birth there would be a hell of a lot less assholes claiming they can't wear condoms
t1_dsx2dgi	1	*	> the largest state or something  Besides Texas, of course.
t1_dsxlk4l	1	*	Oh so you can control what people say in Canada? That's nice. I'm glad you like saying what people can and can't say.

t1_dswrkpb	0	*	So if they lose a court case they only have to change the law to make it more exclusive? What happened to the charter? 
t1_dsx2hd8	0	*	We have free speech, the government just won't fund the kkk
t1_dswow5s	0	*	I listed the ways in the comment. Advocate for better baby care after birth, not just activism for before birth. 
t1_dswrcp5	0	*	It's black and white on Reddit because whiny little bitches downvote everything they disagree with. How dare someone else to express a different opinion where their sensitive eyes might stray.
t1_dsx7s94	0	*	I don't see the distinction you are trying to make.  If nobody is legally allowed to stop you from doing something, then it is your legal right to be able to do that thing.
t1_dswqxmf	1	*	Actually my college nickname lol. Lived on a sailboat.
t1_dswqxmk	1	*	How else does the pastor get in
t1_dswkd06	0	*	Weird. I was just now talking to an atheist anti-abortionist. Needless to say it solidifies your argument. 
t1_dswmaij	1	*	Getting funding from the government isnt, no. Getting equal treatment is. 
t1_dswr2kk	0	*	I love it when Americans try say that our politics are just messed up because not enough of us are white, like using the word homogeneous makes that somehow not grossly, blatantly racist
t1_dszt4c6	1	*	The entire point of the *Charter* is to protect individual rights against this kind of majoritarian tyranny. 
t1_dsxqx7j	1	*	Same with Canada. We dont have any party representing the alt-right equivalent. 
t1_dswqx9v	1	*	It just means less children get a Christmas present from this organization...
t1_dswswoe	1	*	How is not wanting to kill a baby backwards?
t1_dswl4tw	0	*	Are you saying that not kissing Xtian asses is of the same level as saying hate-speech is bad?  I pray I never meet you.
t1_dswxhp2	0	*	>small, geographically/ethnically/culturally homogeneous country  This is always the excuse
t1_dswxp7o	1	*	Scientist here - we don't say shit about the law.

t1_dswsiq0	1	*	Thanks, Kialo PR guy 
t1_dswkg8l	0	*	Any Christian group that is not anti-abortion is free to sign the new declaration the funding requires and they'll get the money.  So there's do problem there. 
t1_dswwzfm	1	*	You are correct sir it was the asshole from a Kitchener/Waterloo riding. I'm sorry about that guy, didn't vote for him, but none the less sorry from my riding.

t1_duzw47w	1	*	Yeah, but an international deal is an intentional deal. This would be the equivalent of reinstating the Iranian sanctions because the US government changed. 
t1_duzim0a	1	*	As someone that lives here, much of this is true. The weeb sentiment over Japan on reddit is sometimes mind-boggling.
t1_dshum1q	1	*	I find that unlikely in this case. Bermuda's biggest religious group is Anglican Christians. Who are fine with gay marriage and even have gay pastors.

t1_dtprpd9	1	*	Maybe the pressure offsets the ability for the bpc to leach in to the liquid?
t1_dtpwm1s	0	*	Specifically, are you measuring free estrogen, or are you doing blood sampling? Also, do you know what species you are testing, and your n?   I've had success measuring free cortisol from sunfish.
t1_dtq7o2b	1	*	What if the research has already been done?  What if industrialists have been using BPA to control overpopulation?  Why is it so hard for people to make the leap toward this line of questioning?
t1_dtqatn5	1	*	People never believe me when I bring it up in conversation. It's crazy that this isn't discussed more. I only found out about it a month or two ago
t1_dtq6r0t	1	*	Why waste time on this and not just answer the real question; is it turning the fricken frogs gay?

t1_dtrjzud	1	*	well technically so is the BPA, so we aren't really getting anywhere with this line of thought.
t1_dtpw8wn	1	*	And I typically try to clean up after myself. I live with 4 other people, and there's often 6 people who have the microwave used for them on the average day.
t1_dtq1xh4	1	*	And what if you are doing it everyday all day long?  You know, asking for a friend. 
t1_dtq3e04	0	*	Why is it taking so long
t1_dtpzye5	1	*	Just have to buy the super cheap ones. No coating on those. I buy them specifically so I can microwave stuff on them at work when I need to.

t1_dtpy6fa	1	*	Pop quizzes were emergencies back then. 
t1_dtpx171	1	*	Unfortunately, in many instances, they replaced the BPA with chemicals that are nearly identical to BPA.  BPS, for instance, has the same biological properties.
t1_dthy8nt	1	*	Thata true- neither does Russia.  Or International mobsters.    I love how Im being called fascist because the President is trying to kill the investigation into his own buffoonery 
t1_dtd7gjr	1	*	That must be why we classify every military-age male in a combat zone an armed combatant. That way when we bomb weddings and funeral processions it's not a war crime.
t1_dtdj4rs	0	*	I was trying to be sarcastic
t1_dtd8zvm	0	*	You should look at what you define as worthy? I'd say not killing civilians would be worth it. Or if this person is that 'low level' leave it alone. I can't see a justification to ever bomb civilians.
t1_dtcxpuo	1	*	It was my least favorite movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm a sucker for happy movies though.
t1_dtd9bww	1	*	The only thing we will learn from him is him pointing at how he got his funds and weapons from US middle east allies and that wouldn't be great especially after 9/11.
t1_dteohv5	0	*	The life span of woman is usually longer than men. But that's not the case in Afghanistan. And it has very little to do with war. It has to do with their treatment of woman.

t1_dujfx2q	1	*	You say that like demagoguery isn't an inherent problem of democracy.
t1_dujpo82	0	*	Sorry im out of it this morning; does that mean that all trade simply going through the port is considered as originating from the port if its re-loaded from one ship onto another there?
t1_dujhxkf	0	*	Democracy doesn't mean you have to vote on every decision made by the government though. I'd suggest decisions like this should be made by the people who actually have a vague clue what it would mean.
t1_duk4t0k	1	*	Why would the EU grant the UK a better deal than their members get?

t1_dufiuog	1	*	If a death sentence isn't successful they will try to kill him 3 more times. Normally in the unlikely event of surviving a death sentence it is unlawful to repeat it.
t1_dufv4jm	0	*	No these conditions are for the Islamic punishments called Hudud, if the circumstantial evidence is sufficient he will be convicted and killed through tazeer ..  nice try though. 
t1_dufpnw5	0	*	they should have anime courts instead of sharia courts

t1_duuw69d	1	*	I didn't say its the same system, but we still have many of the same downsides, especially concerning generational wealth, power and income inequality. Yes it's improved, but we can still do better. 
t1_dsralbv	0	*	They have other rights as well. Citizens United affirms corporations have the right of free speech. That is a social right. 
t1_du68yhj	1	*	You, mostly.
t1_du69uqv	0	*	The problem with most of Europe is language not the quality of education. But still us is top.dog and UK is number 2 but only because of Oxford and Cambridge
t1_du6enaj	1	*	Depends where you want to go to school, and for what program. I think its relatively cheap in Quebec.

t1_dthkk1b	1	*	Last year in Australia we had a bunch of child care workers pushing for wage increases and using wages in the underground mining sector as their benchmark.  Wut.
t1_ds62xfa	1	*	Are the enslavers islamists or just douchebag human smuggler types?   Assholes exist without needing religion to justify their actions you know....
t1_dtzhbpd	0	*	Wish i was european. Ive been to Ireland and Italy and i have to say people are way more focused on their own lives instead of these useless politics. People in europe really know how to live it up. 
t1_dtgu92y	1	*	Very recently, at that. 
t1_du04dgv	1	*	I agree.
t1_dt8im4u	0	*	Not really. China has a strong military but doesn't need to deploy it. Their trade and monetary clout are enough.  Look up Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and how that ended. 
t1_dt0g4ik	0	*	What was the location of Israel prior to 1BCE?
t1_dt2o34j	0	*	You mean the terrorists?
t1_dub6erx	1	*	This chart is kinda redundant. It is diagonally symmetric, so really either the top or the bottom triangle alone would suffice. 
t1_dua93cw	0	*	Huh? The US didn't help Israel in any existential war. In fact Israel is perfectly fine arming itself, but the US kinda gives them weaponry for free
t1_ds31z8w	1	*	*My* money is valuable, *your* time is worthless /s(?)
t1_dujsubd	0	*	By want measure are you comment not garbage?     1 Jews was killing British soldiers - and they became heroes.  2 The Palestinian issue is still an issue    
t1_dukkpfa	0	*	Curious how given your conspiracy theory your post has 17 upvotes. Those JIDF must be as bad at their job at downvoting posts as they are genociding Palestinians.
t1_dujfu63	0	*	The Chief Rabbinate has banned Jews from visiting Temple Mount since 1921 and has more recently reiterated this in 2013. 
t1_dul94ux	1	*	Are they hiring? haha  
t1_dujwbzs	0	*	Thank goodness! I am relieved to know that words have absolutely no consequences and never will. 
t1_ducfypi	1	*	So you've got a vested interest in this and expect anyone to believe you're giving a fair appraisal instead of misrepresenting the reality of the situation to protect your income? That's cute.
t1_ducypwi	0	*	https://imgur.com/Pw2IVoU  Mostly sunflower oil but some coconut oil  It's not really sugar free though, maltitol has about the same amount of carbs as sugar.

t1_dsprdg7	0	*	It's from the God Delusion, right? I lent my copy out so I can't check.
t1_dspgdaa	0	*	Except of course that is nonsense and the opposite is true... Man ceated God in his image. Surely everyone recognises this now thanks to the internet.
t1_dspfyja	1	*	I thought your point was atheism is worse than religion. But if it's simply that people are assholes and will kill each other for quite literally no reason, I can't argue that.
t1_dsoswut	0	*	Considering God is not real every single person who claims to speak to God is a liar or delusional or both.

t1_ds7pqdz	1	*	Likely Euro or Yuan.
t1_ds6eh8k	1	*	Its probably tied the opposite way around. Trump was pissed about it, so he tweeted.  Though this may be giving his knowledge of world events too much credit.
t1_ds7j75y	1	*	That's basically why we've been giving them money. They've never explicitly said give us aid or we'll sell warheads to North Korea, but it's implied.

t1_dtgbry7	1	*	The MIC creates war and sells weapons.  Media tycoons create villains and sell outrage.  Neither are in any real danger from their targets.
t1_dtge4m1	1	*	The British Prime Minister is Theresa May. 
t1_dtgg81l	1	*	I'd say hypocrisy in general is when you talk about one thing but do another. Doesn't matter if it's your principles or not, since we can't objectively measure that kind of thing.
t1_dtge7w2	1	*	> a pig squealing  Wrong Prime Minister, David Cameron would love that.
t1_dtg08fy	1	*	On both sides of the protests about taking the statue down. Not in the Nazi vs. Antifa battle; but the actual locals who felt attached to the history vs. PC nuts.

t1_dtfu2s3	1	*	I never said it did. You werent specific about a British vote, so you got the correct answer.  Oh, and while we are here, Brexit wasnt a vote, it was a plebiscite. 
t1_dtgncft	1	*	Logged in just to upvoted this. As an American you guys sure do have a talent for insults that is missing over here. 
t1_dth19hy	0	*	You sound like you have a tenuous at best grasp at the english languge.
t1_dtgfnks	1	*	Megabus, who's going to stump up for a national express?
t1_dtgadpv	1	*	No, it's an English word. It's derived from a Latin word but it's in English now. 
t1_dtnpok3	0	*	The race isn't what matters, the culture of the people is. It's a terrible idea to have mass immigration from countries that don't share your values.
t1_dtnq2w6	0	*	So could you.
t1_dtn9021	1	*	yeah, well, ya know, that's just like, your opinion man.
t1_dto5ifs	0	*	How about paying EU immigrants decent wages, thus, bringing them at the same level of competitivity with locals? That would work. Companies wouldn't favour immigrants.
t1_dtrog4o	1	*	I don't care what race or skin colour they are, like i said its about immigrating the people that fill the skill gaps we have, so add value to society.
t1_dtnfvqo	1	*	I think one issue that has helped fucked you both is non-compulsory voting.
t1_dtmu4bc	0	*	No you see what you do is you take the reasoned analysis by economists, then you CALL it fear-mongering, then when asked to explain your analysis you roll up a bus with big money printed on the side

t1_dto3xmw	0	*	You're discussing broad facts. I gave you the specific reason that the Independent is treated with caution on this site. Stop getting defensive and try approaching a question for its answer. 
t1_dtmps4r	1	*	Being the PM that Implemented Brexit seems like it's also going to be political suicide. 
t1_dtmyfvf	0	*	The burden of proof is on the person making the claim. It is not my responsibility to find sources. I am not the one attempting to persuade others of an opinion.

t1_dv4hpt8	1	*	> internal racism  Source? I extremely doubt this is the case.

t1_dt9299x	0	*	Nope, he's quite stupid.
t1_dui7pch	1	*	Right you shouldn't leave a note, but leaving a note shouldn't be against the law. Also you think this person deserves to die over this? You must have some demons to deal with.
t1_dv1ophc	1	*	Pluck your head off your body like an olive off a toothpick.

t1_duckoml	1	*	Show me your superiority big boy. Why am I uncivilised?
t1_dudwk1z	1	*	Is the will of the government always representing the will of the people?
t1_ducb77i	1	*	Because orange is the dutch colour? Or is this a weed joke.
t1_dud65f8	1	*	Yes, and swastikas are used in non-Nazi contexts. Not by Nazis, though, because then it's pretty much sbout Nazism. What's your point?
t1_duc9i1t	1	*	That's because it's excited.
t1_ducts64	0	*	Perhaps you should. He has a seat, he has voting power, he's part of the government. opposition is just a label.
t1_du2dvzr	1	*	Yes!!!  I left that open as shit to see if someone would say that.  
t1_dseetan	0	*	> but none that are particularly unusual for a developing economy.  I think killing and imprisoning people because of their religious beliefs counts as unusual.

t1_duoqrv3	0	*	Yeah, as an agnostic, I have my qualms with Judaism and Christianity, but at least their prophets didn't marry and bang an 8 year old.
t1_dunhayv	1	*	Don't try to bring facts or nuance to a circle jerk.
t1_dunl087	1	*	Which is all the more ironic because Rome typically did a good job of combining religions and beliefs in order to draw conquered people into the fold.
t1_dunabg5	0	*	That's true, however women are expected to dress modestly and cover all other exposed body parts. Angela Merkel made headlines last year when she didn't wear a headscarf.
t1_duold65	1	*	 This is hilarious, I'm following you
t1_duo9qrk	1	*	If they were refusing to shake anyone's hand, then that's one thing.  But refusing to shake the hands of only women, that's another.
t1_duncmj6	1	*	We should not be tolerant of bad ideas.  Misogyny is a bad idea, no matter where it occurs.  There are no free passes for those claiming it's part of their culture.
t1_dunpoy3	1	*	Colleges and Universities in North America seem to sometimes have this.
t1_dunjhtr	1	*	Gotta say, that's an interesting point.
t1_dunowm5	1	*	You need that Arab cheek Hi kiss. Then you would understand what culture is. 
t1_dunq6zi	0	*	That's the thing though, I can't think of a single religion that adheres to feminist tenets. Feminism is a modern idea that is hard, if not impossible, to apply to belief sets formed millennia ago.

t1_dsyk0s7	1	*	In the US, due to the separation of the executive from the legislature and the fixed elections, there's no real process for a no confidence election. 
t1_dsyk24f	1	*	Do you have USAA or Navy Fed? Navy Fed at least has said they are going to add an opt in for a 0% loan for whatever your last pay was until the shutdown ends.

t1_du58tg2	0	*	The EU set it's goal for 40% below 1990 in in 2005, the same year the US did for 17% below 2005. The percentages are simple, emit x% less CO2 than your country/organization did in y year.
t1_du6gnzf	0	*	and somehow Chinese population grew from a 400 million to 1 billion under his administration. I like how brainless people read some baseless facts and throw them around like it's truth

t1_dsx6pw6	1	*	Because it's Pakistan. I didn't think women had any rights there

t1_dswmlvg	0	*	Might take you up on it, just make sure you're thorough. 
t1_dsxnlx0	1	*	> and at anytime before the modern era would have died after the first few births  Lol, no.  Plenty of women had more than three children prior to the modern era.

t1_dtg8nph	1	*	I guarantee if you were standing in front of the killer of your friends family youd pull the trigger too. That he simply shot him in the head and didnt beat the man to death is actually surprising. 
t1_dud2ynn	0	*	Right. Im not arguing how effective a civilian would be if provided a weapon, Im just saying if you give every class room a gun it would most likely lead to more shootings, not less. 
t1_dunfdgb	1	*	NYC homeless are more nuts than anyone else's homeless.
t1_dunulof	1	*	they sadly realized that they can earn more on the short term by being divisive, even though we all lose on the long term.
t1_dv3z40i	1	*	Well, the Brits are not allowed to have the prestige of a trading empire anymore so I guess they are just self-deprecating. 
t1_dshve3r	0	*	Yea, like how the white majority of Alabama elected Roy Moore to represent the state in the Senate, or the white majority of the United States elected Romney to be their president in 2008?

t1_duw8jg4	1	*	Me neither... he just pigs around the with house and watches TV. He is the most racist and dumbest person I've ever seen. He just fucks up the world after Obama made it a little bit better place.

t1_dt0fog6	0	*	The fact that it took the board this long to boot him tells me that they are just as big of dicks as he is but they will appear to be better because of money.  Will never buy pizza there again.

t1_dsjb8wy	0	*	Trump got elected first try. Wilders has been trying for almost a decade now. He has got a lot more votes than I'd like to, though. And last I heard it's still slowly increasing.
t1_dsj978h	1	*	Yeah, you're absolutely right. 
t1_dsjhcu2	0	*	In our defence, that politician said eat me. In hindsight he might not have been completely sincere with that statement but nothing we can do about that now.
t1_dsjh6p4	1	*	Its clearly displayed in the 30 second video that was linked. 
t1_dsj8wd1	1	*	Wow calling a whole group of people retarded minions I hope you arent in a position of influence with whatever you do. 
t1_dsjnp8d	1	*	Not typical, just about half
t1_dsjip6b	1	*	The big companies may have been consolidating, but there are more and more small ones out there, and its never been easier for little media companies to broadcast their message.
t1_dsjeezo	1	*	Ah, who could forget Leopold II who was literally more fucked up than Hitler
t1_dskdqyr	1	*	Ah ok.  Thanks for the clarification.
t1_dsjkjqe	1	*	When they asked him the question and he was silent it was kind of like that Simpsons episode when Homer did jury duty.  Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow
t1_dsjal1j	0	*	Then the proper statement would be to blame the DNC, not simply liberals and democrats. As that places blame on all the voters.  And generalizing 300 million people is always wrong.
t1_dsjq23h	1	*	Trumpers already think the media is woefully unfair to them. Good luck trying to hold them to a standard when they'll just go watch Fox News where there's almost none.
t1_dsjbpl6	0	*	Gadver!
t1_dsjit5s	0	*	you're delusional. in what way is your prison system improving? you imprison more people every year
t1_dsjengm	1	*	Fuck off, a no go zone is a very specific thing of which there exists none in Sweden. 
t1_dsjdfm8	0	*	Would be great if there was a hidden /s. Click to view if this comment was sarcasm.
t1_dsj7b6u	1	*	This is ~40% of america. 
t1_dsjikxz	1	*	Thats where youre mistaken. They are dismantling a ton while appointing far right judges. They are also extremely capable of looting the treasury. 
t1_dsjdt0h	1	*	Helping poor uneducated people has a cost. It's still the right thing to do. 
t1_dsjasnp	0	*	But I thought John Snow didn't know anything. 
t1_dsjo6wo	0	*	I'm getting an urge to flood the countryside to keep the Spanish out. Does this make me Dutch?
t1_dsjjlmq	1	*	Stop pretending it's not a typical American. 63 million people voted for Trump, who's arguably worse than this ambassador.
t1_dsjaevk	1	*	I lived in the states for 6 months. This is pretty typical in my experience. It's such an isolationist nation that they tend to run into trouble when their worldview clashes with reality.
t1_dsjpztv	1	*	And of those who did vote for him, most voted directly against their own self-interest. They were easily manipulated, and we all have to pay the price for that.
t1_dsjp4l9	1	*	Hes not an idiot. A lying, Machiavellian, soulless, cockwart, but hes not stupid. He just thinks everyone else is. 
t1_dsjqpox	1	*	They are far more outnumbered than the American ones.
t1_dsjaz22	1	*	The problem is, as all major systemic problems in this democracy, squarely on the shoulders of Joe and Jane Voter, for their forgiveness of the unforgivable.

t1_dsjjy84	1	*	People were just a lot more efficient in those days.   Waste not, want not. 
t1_dsj81mn	1	*	Cocaine is bad? 
t1_dsjs0gm	1	*	I am curious too. I guess that it is only a red herring
t1_dsjkxl8	1	*	Land of the free... compared to the Netherlands? Never has that been close to true.
t1_dsixr65	1	*	But then again look who we put in charge over ***here*** to represent ***our*** country. Americans are currently lost in the woods and throwing a temper tantrum instead of looking for a way out.
t1_dsj7i2w	1	*	*maybe* he meant they were talked back to in a witty, demeaning way... but I don't think so.
t1_dsjdoyt	0	*	17th century Dutch politics were metal as fuck.

t1_dsjhp96	0	*	Thank the good lord all those evil people who were caught with a stick of weed on them got locked up so your streets are safe!

t1_dsjkc4s	1	*	Shame really; the Dutch as a people are probably the nicest I've met along with Canadians. 
t1_dsjlqaw	1	*	Yeah, it's a cop out, but from a selfish point of view it would have been the smart thing for him to do.
t1_dsjdy4t	0	*	This draws a very scewed image. I'm not talking about the amount of people who *could* vote, I'm talking about the amount of people who *actually voted*.
t1_dsjoh88	1	*	I think the closest thing in English might be cringe.
t1_dsl8l7r	1	*	He's even more crazy than I thought
t1_dsjb75x	1	*	We used to stand up for what was right.
t1_dsk9rnj	0	*	An ambassador isn't even a government official, he's a civil servant.
t1_dsj80q3	1	*	Well, it's interesting now.
t1_dsjchh8	1	*	Yeah, I thought his name sounded familiar. Turns out he was a Representative from my state. At least I was too young to vote when he was in office.
t1_duzgjr0	0	*	Thats my plan.
t1_dtob3c1	1	*	Yes you can. The difference though. Germany hadn't had that many knife attacks before. Not every country is as violent as the middle east and USA. But we are currently on the way of becoming it.
t1_dt3txlp	1	*	Nice, it's the second time I'm being called like this. First time was in /r/communism when they banned me for telling the truth.

t1_ds79sfa	1	*	Bullshit.
t1_ds84z08	1	*	I think that alcohol can also be a nasty habit, but there are some positives as well. I can't think of a positive outcome from smoking.
t1_ds6ulod	0	*	Really? Ive never heard that do you have a source? Not doubting you just want to read more. 
t1_ds71wlb	0	*	As of last year, the FDA actually has a pretty strong hold on what can go into e-juice.
t1_ds7zbf4	1	*	Totally true, didn't think of that. I wonder if any dieticians ever recommend nicotine gum or vaping for weight loss? Some days I could easily live on cigs and water and not get hungry at all. 
t1_ds7lmw2	1	*	Worked for Phillip Morris (on the us side) . I would VERY surprised to ever see a green Marlboro 
t1_ds7oecp	0	*	You realize that Bannon joined the campaign months after the meeting took place right?

t1_du19i6j	1	*	You mean his strange orange tint that is not around his eyes because he wears goggles when getting spray taned.  Those white circles are the only spots that show his true skin color.
t1_du03j8v	1	*	Me as well
t1_du098a8	1	*	>  The idea was to mock both leaders.   I'm not sure I get the joke. They're just watching the event and acting like friends. Wouldn't that be preferable to the current hostilities?
t1_du05vf8	0	*	He's not making an argument. He's pointing out the dude posts in r/conservative.

t1_du02paw	0	*	Not rly 
t1_du0ako8	0	*	Oxford comma bruh.    Impersonators of Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un would mean Kim Jong-un hanging out with a bunch of Donald Trump impersonators.
t1_du04xjt	1	*	Didnt know Trump owned slaves. But if you say so. 
t1_du032k7	1	*	They are actually. 
t1_du0c3rz	1	*	The thing you cut, duh.
t1_du0qspl	1	*	That's exactly what I was thinking
t1_du0asj2	1	*	Aside from the actual point of your comment, I'm glad that people are starting to disassociate leftists with liberals. 
t1_du0c68d	0	*	You doubt that Donald Trump likes to receive unnecessary attention?
t1_du0te2p	0	*	The reason Donald trump got elected is because the other option was Hillary. Literally any other democrat would've crushed trump.
t1_dtco18t	0	*	You've given Zero examples of what you want the system to change into, can you please provide me with some clear examples of what you propose to be a better system than the one we have now?

t1_dsjvr9p	0	*	It really is, I cant believe it. What are some solid news sources? reddit or not.
t1_dsjpujr	0	*	Unnamed source is not synonymous with anonymous source. The outlet knows who their sources are; thats how this works.  
t1_dumkroh	1	*	Same standard of living? Are you insane?
t1_dulo8nl	0	*	Yes I suppose some small % of people would just waste it away. Willing to bet most of those parents in poverty would spend it on things their kids need before getting extra crap. 
t1_dumcf3h	1	*	You're projecting. I did not say, or infer anything of the sort. But It is a question that needs to he asked. 
t1_dumdmxk	0	*	Are you suggesting people should keep having children they can't support to have them live in poverty, suffer worse life opportunities and abuse, and have to deal with higher rates of crime?
t1_dunpnpg	0	*	Yeah I kind of agree. The whole outlook on that is confusing to me. Being a young, unwed single mother is looked upon favorably as some kind of virtuous plight that couldn't have been avoided. 
t1_dsp51e7	1	*	So then it shouldnt be a problem to put in this extra money as well? 
t1_dsoqtqm	1	*	I dont want to, they should shut the place down!
t1_dspk0i8	1	*	The EU is not one nation it is  28 and ppl only try to think of them as one when it's convenient to their argument.  
t1_dsozp25	0	*	No, you didn't really clarify anything. African-Americans are Americans and their homeland is the US, not Africa. So, again it seems only jews apply this multiplier as you call it.

t1_dtnyl4s	1	*	Do you actually know what a Hadith is?
t1_dv47dr0	0	*	Not really a girl if ya still got a dick, he may have estrogen therapy or whatever for his blossoming bosoms but that don't make him a female
t1_dv47npn	1	*	Ignorant is the word you're looking for, not pessimistic. You ignorant pessimist.
t1_dv3rlto	1	*	Maybe.
t1_dv40kex	0	*	That may or may not be good depending on where you live. Where I am in SoCal, hell to the nah. Flyover states, sure. 
t1_dv45m99	1	*	Yeah, plus, $19 in NYC is like $7 everywhere else. Factor in gas and wear and tear and it's even less. 
t1_dtvm80h	1	*	I read up on that just now because you mentioned it. Its pretty disappointing as well. Thankfully in Germany and the EU there is a vocal group trying to have the law removed.
t1_dv11bgl	0	*	This is so true.  I gave up wasting my time on religion to concentrate on the important things, like masturbation!

t1_dursed0	1	*	Yes, I understand it, it's still embarrassing that Trump needs to have his ego stroke in order to give someone attention. 
t1_durtmhj	0	*	So is it a fundamental right to own cannons and howitzers?
t1_dur9l18	0	*	A for instance. From a source that isnt either snopes or Fox News.  Something credible instead.   http://thefederalist.com/2015/09/03/the-australian-gun-ban-conceit/

t1_durlndq	1	*	So, what do you propose?  
t1_durpdud	1	*	Cuz Murica! :) No worries. Im used to it. Im just happy to see people fighting back against the NRA and the other folks that deny guns play a role in these shootings.

t1_dt1ueum	0	*	Prohibition means that there is a lot of illegal money to be made.  Illegal money draws in dangerous people....like Al Capone during American prohibition.
t1_dt1yxy3	1	*	So that means we should ignore facts because you're emotional? How did heroin being illegal go for your friends?
t1_dt2363e	1	*	that's exactly what the public needs to see.    not a piece of shit.  too many families hide the fact that their child died of an overdose.  Let the world know.
t1_ds564kn	1	*	Thanks :')

t1_duhxncd	1	*	Hahaha, I didn't even catch that either
t1_dui2k0u	1	*	Median is the amount that half of the population earn less and the half more. If the median is 12.50 then no, most people don't make 8/h.

t1_dui200q	0	*	I think he was making a joke about how people used to come to America for their shot at making it in life, and now you're seeing learn German, move to Dubai instead. 
t1_duiiwil	0	*	Human development index I guess. 0.909 puts the UK above France, Austria, Belgium, Finland (surprising), Japan and South Korea 
t1_dui35kr	0	*	Wait til we see the aftermath of the hard Brexit in the UK, it's gonna make the Greek crisis look like a lunch break. 
t1_duia9tb	1	*	The Chinese own all the debt they could call it in and then the UK becomes China. All welfare stops at that point. Strict Chinese law takes over. 
t1_dui16pu	0	*	Australia gets out good because they basically dig money out of the ground.
t1_dui5wp9	1	*	Yeah, I don't love our university fees, but I'm fucking grateful we're not America. 
t1_dui3l96	0	*	It's actually just theft from the public purse. If you're rich enough to do too much damage to the economy for a state to let you fail, you can take what you want regardless of risk. 
t1_duhx3ih	0	*	Drugs, booze, crime, and have babies they can't afford.  
t1_dui2moc	0	*	That's not how I read it. Seems more like Brexit has already caused harm, and its going to also contribute to this.
t1_dui2nda	1	*	They're the worse kind of white only nation- the kind with brown people. Lol 
t1_duig4vz	1	*	No they won't.
t1_dui3yaw	0	*	So because you and one other person had good fortune, that must mean everyone else is just doing things wrong. Ah.
t1_dujc71w	0	*	What a reputable fucking source. **Every single** article is about how Soros is evil, or how immigrants are nothing but criminals, or how the EU is an authoritarian regime.   Clearly unbiased. 
t1_duj5cvq	0	*	Highly engaging strawman bro.

t1_dui3szy	0	*	gremlin folk dear lord
t1_dui5sa3	1	*	Typically, crime, which is why American teenagers are not allowed to roam freely all day but rather are held in [lightly disguised prisons](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html).
t1_duidoaf	1	*	This is really anecdotal evidence and shouldn't necessarily be taken as a sign of the general trend, even though I suspect it would be concordant, I'd love a source to confirm. 
t1_dui37s6	1	*	rural ignorance and overzealous patriotism strike again...
t1_dui01ca	0	*	>Is everyone on government assistance?  Greece was literally forced to remove any form of help to its citizens to pay off greedy bankers that were conveniently bailed out when they failed.
t1_dui5hbr	1	*	None from leaving now, not none from 1970's
t1_duibn9j	1	*	edited for clarity
t1_dui12wl	1	*	Depends on where you go. Santorini and Mykonos are expensive, in Paros you get very good value for your money. Just dont go to the hotspots.
t1_duhyeuk	1	*	And all those homes got bought up for nothing by slumlords who now rent them out for outrageous prices.  But what are you gonna do to escape the rent trap? Buy a property? LOL

t1_dtsqbnj	1	*	Yeah, sorry been a while since I read that chapter lol
t1_dtsvkft	0	*	The widespread adoption of information technology is compelling people to have a firm foundation of logic and reason.
t1_dtswmli	1	*	Yeah IME Persians just generally value intelligence, thoughtfulness, and educated open-mindedness. 
t1_dtuea3a	1	*	Yes I know Ive been to Iran twice and love the country, but when you say the government is going back to their secular roots I have to disagree. The government in power now has Islamist roots. 
t1_dttmnhu	0	*	Hijab isn't ban in France and many wear it (much more than in the US). But religious signs are ban in public places mainly because of islamic proselytism in schools and hospitals.
t1_dtt7a4x	1	*	Look, he made his mind up about feminists. Your facts mean nothing here.
t1_dtuny09	0	*	Is a regime change worth a million dead?
t1_dtsznu6	1	*	Yes, propaganda is a sound source of historical information /s
t1_dtsthvx	0	*	They just said that they disagree with it. Understanding a perspective doesn't necessarily mean you have to agree with it.
t1_dtt6d8p	1	*	Yes you're correct. I misused the word secular
t1_dttk2op	0	*	Not necessary. Some countries ban religious signs (not just Muslim ones) like France, to avoid proselytism in public places. Nothing to do with xenophobic attitudes.
t1_dtt0o7j	1	*	There seems to be a big difference between citizens and terrorists
t1_dtsltkv	1	*	Happens.
t1_dtt48rv	0	*	And who was behind the  coup
t1_dtt321x	1	*	Kind of
t1_dtt9ryo	1	*	Loving the US, the main world imperialist power, is hardly progressive.
t1_dtssv1l	1	*	he was nationalising bp oilfields the uk convinced cia it was communism and pushed for the topple.It was not multiple industry just oil.
t1_dtt2ywn	1	*	Mossadegh? Meh. He probably wouldn't have lasted long even without Operation Ajax. When the clergy turned against him he lost a *lot* of his support all at once. 
t1_dtt0rzq	0	*	You lost me because people *should* be allowed to walk around naked
t1_dtsuzrs	0	*	i was agreeing with you lmao  the problem is being forced to do something, not what they're doing
t1_dtt14q9	1	*	That's irrelevant to the question I was answering.

t1_du314k5	0	*	Just ask anyone that has bought anything over asking price in Vancouver this past few years - because they have more money than God and they can?
t1_du2pu5t	0	*	A Russian bought property in Florida to overturn a.sanctions law that happened years later?
t1_du2vl20	1	*	We're suppose to believe, Obama is the school records faker and Trump is the one who got into school by his own merit.   Opioids I tell you, they erased reality in red states.  
t1_du3bvft	1	*	So, any thoughts on how the story youre trying to sell is wrong, or are you just going to try and sell it again somewhere else like a lying asshole?
t1_dspkyzn	0	*	I dont know the guy so cant comment on him but I dont think jumping to calling it racism helps the debate about how to stop anti Vaxxers of all religions and none from fucking up their children

t1_ds15rfa	1	*	Probably referring to Saturday morning cartoon villains

t1_ds12od3	1	*	No, you can see Vancouver, as you drone about trying to find parking, and then head back out towards the suburbs and leave before you end up in the wrong hood.
t1_ds15sl3	0	*	Find an old childrens cartoon from the 80/90s, look at how the villian is acts.

t1_dscrla5	0	*	You mean live in Montreal?
t1_dujxu50	1	*	Why not use that as salt for cooking? That seems to be an obvious solution. Don't we have the tech. for that yet?
t1_dujethx	1	*	Actually a pretty perfect analogy tbh
t1_dujrkxi	1	*	Quantum of Solace called it!
t1_dujdgkj	1	*	This is what all my environmental science professors constantly say
t1_duiwygf	1	*	cost and corruption will come into play
t1_duiypk3	0	*	Dilute it? With what?
t1_dujzcaw	1	*	at cost is a bullshit term. Usually (easily) overestimate everyone's operating costs 
t1_dujhyrd	0	*	I mean it's really simple. Uk donates 18 million pounds to SA. Exact cost of Zuma's renovations to his private estate. How much is a desalination plant ? 
t1_dsrr0ov	1	*	When my wage wasn't in any form of $ to begin with? For all its faults, at least the people behind the  came up with a unique symbol for it.
t1_dsrfudi	1	*	Yeah, real life is just like a video game...

t1_dsgr65p	0	*	It was a dark and stormy time.  
t1_dsgrcgj	1	*	My man
t1_dsaasc3	1	*	No, you are misunderstanding, and your understanding is a result of state Department marketing.   We are suspending Bribes, the word aide was used to describe the bribes in a less nefarious manner. 
t1_dttyud3	1	*	Next step- profit???
t1_dtd0okq	1	*	at will employment is fucking criminal! fucking no protection for the little guys
t1_dsfagwa	1	*	I am also guilty of shit posting, I think my issue is finding a sub that is less about shit posting and also doesnt make me feel dumb like r/neutralpolitics does.  That nice Middle is out there.
t1_dsertf6	0	*	Was he talking about huge military spending..... in Puerto Rico? Post-hurricane??
t1_dsg4c7j	0	*	I'd find that hard to believe, but I honestly don't know what I would do. Probably search Amazon for something to scrape my jaw off the ground. 
t1_dsevndi	1	*	Sleep.....
t1_dsfhhbt	1	*	He won't be.  The responses to these written questions will be written by trump's lawyers on his behalf.  I'm a lawyer.  It's a very poor substitute for direct oral questioning.
t1_dselx60	0	*	Investigator Bueller?  I thought he was taking a day off..
t1_dseu1qe	1	*	chickens go in, pies come out.

t1_dsg254q	1	*	I think he refuses to read those though.  God I cant believe were having this conversation about the POTUS.
t1_dseofm3	1	*	Was that a joke? If so he has a serious poker face
t1_dsetz33	0	*	The thing is though, you dont have to be successful. The crime is in trying. 
t1_dseo1to	0	*	No presidential pardons for state charges?
t1_dsevbu4	1	*	To be fair, Trump does provide for his family. So 1 out of 3 is not bad
t1_dsf5kac	1	*	I don't remember that being part of the criteria in the Constitution.
t1_dsepyfq	1	*	Trump will lose the house and probably the Senate. 
t1_dsntnul	1	*	Also how I keep hearing of Japanese tourists visiting war memorials/museums in Singapore and getting shocked by what their history classes didn't cover.
t1_dtuqyjw	0	*	And it should be. When you're drunk, you can at least theoretically pay attention to the road. When you're texting you aren't even looking at it. 
t1_dtwi5xb	1	*	You must be joking, have you ever been to Portugal?
t1_dtv88m9	0	*	I thought that constantly turning the engine on and off used more gas than just idling?
t1_dtv967k	1	*	Yep, mate of mine was in heavy traffic and was on his phone while the traffic was stopped. He turned his head when there was a knock at the window. Cop gave him a ticket right there.

t1_ds3kgb2	0	*	Is it PC to say the option that realises the highest level of accuracy should be used? 
t1_ds4tca5	1	*	We're talking about Germany here, not a bomb shelter in nuclear winter. There's no relevant scarcity to take into consideration.
t1_dspw4j3	1	*	Lol. That was good. Pretty pretty pretty pretty good 
t1_dv58ndw	0	*	I mean yeah but the SLAM was feasible in every way it was just that they realized how batshit insane it was.
t1_dvcb3wn	0	*	oh damn

t1_dsz9tli	0	*	Why is /r/Wales on the wall of shame? Not that I've ever visited. 
t1_dsz5ung	1	*	The answer is neither is wrong, that guy doesn't like those things so in his opinion there isn't anything to do. In other peoples opinions there is since they enjoy that stuff.
t1_dswfeqs	0	*	this is an American website and about Americans. Hungary is irrelevant.
t1_dv3mbgc	1	*	They're called the baby boomers for a reason.
t1_dsaw4v1	0	*	The government in the US is pretty much continually corrupted by oil and alternative sources are all done in the private sector when it should be something the government should be perusing full time.
t1_ds4ikp0	1	*	Oi try not being a cunt it might improve your life a bit
t1_dsyblu5	0	*	It is, without any doubt.   Trying to sow division among the left.
t1_duo8drj	1	*	I like that, going to have to remember it.
t1_duo0tbr	1	*	Tim Hortons can, idk about McDonalds... Starbucks probably does as well and might even have a higher discount.
t1_dunfhtx	0	*	To prove how much I like them? I dunno... It's just something I realized recently.
t1_dunf5jr	1	*	Same in McDonald's. What Canada should do is have stamp cards so they can cash in a free coffee after a certain number of uses.
t1_duneeg4	1	*	We have a bunch of stainless ones and we like them, cant tell a taste difference at all
t1_dunc9r5	1	*	Hold my shit while people on the subway think outdoor BT speaker are cool

t1_dunok0v	0	*	Youre clearly just mad for the sake of being mad
t1_dun8txg	0	*	Will dishwashers clean the insides well? 
t1_dund82o	1	*	It is plastic by the strictest definition, but it will wear away faster than any conventional plastic. Ex: Dixie cup i left outside turned to mush in a week 
t1_dun8ufl	1	*	If you can suck it through a straw you can drink it from the cup.
t1_dunrf5a	1	*	Are those leaves or naan?

t1_dunf0zo	0	*	Thats how they used to be before the 40's
t1_duncn0n	1	*	It does take that long when McDonalds has their hands in the politicians pants convincing them to let them keep using plastic utensils
t1_dungtq8	1	*	Point is, its better to use less or none at all when possible. 
t1_dunkq9q	1	*	I don't know, you have to lift the glass like three inches higher, and there's all that tedious tilting. Plus it makes it hard to see the TV.
t1_duoc9vz	1	*	Some are. There's a guy in, I believe, India who makes edible spoons in several flavours. 
t1_dtnhycl	0	*	What has Russia done?
t1_dttn7q9	0	*	You mean the Electoral College?  I thought Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.
t1_dtt6ket	1	*	I didn't downvote him? I simply was pointing out that instead of asking for someone else to make it interesting, he could have.
t1_dttaldp	1	*	-150 and counting! His I NEVER DEFEND TRUMP posts are hilarious troll posts. I'd have put him on ignore long ago, but I enjoy reading that drivel.
t1_dtsz7u9	1	*	So he commits an obstruction crime, like Nixon
t1_dtti7ta	1	*	You know what, I could actually see him winning. Putin has the leader of the US would also make Europe actually rearm.
t1_dtuw05f	1	*	Alexander Litvinenko?  Bombing Russian apartment buildings?
t1_dttuunj	1	*	> sound like you are implying Trump shouldn't be interviewed because he is too dumb.  I'm pretty sure it's his own lawyers who are implying that

t1_ds7teet	1	*	Trump is such a joke, whenever you make a joke, he fits in.

t1_dspyno1	1	*	Now I'm getting torqued.
t1_dt86kul	0	*	I think most people could assume that he's an unpopular president. I also think that these reposted articles that use Trumps name for clicks are unnecessary. 
t1_ds416zm	1	*	Only one way to find out...
t1_dui9cy8	0	*	What? Your point is that the US dumped in the past so that means China didnt? I never claimed the US hasnt dumped in the past. China was most definitely dumping steel, they sold at a loss.

t1_dt3msqo	1	*	Ah, had no idea and I'll have a look into it

t1_ds6h1jq	1	*	Not really, no.  Really is depends what you mean by 'silence', if you care about free speech at least.  
t1_ds6w575	1	*	Source?

t1_ds6feyn	0	*	TIL cups of tea is a euphemism for buttholes
t1_ds6kskp	1	*	And by the time the appeal goes through the majority of the videos views have already happened meaning it only makes a fraction of what it usually would, rendering the appeal almost useless...
t1_ds6giw6	1	*	That's not what I meant, I meant what kind of sites people actually use are owned by said politicians
t1_ds6pgfu	1	*	Because they pay lip service to the progressive agenda.
t1_ds6r8ri	1	*	Pretty funny
t1_ds6k1t2	1	*	You can pay for more storage for original photo quality storage or free unlimited high quality photo storage. 
t1_ds6icwy	1	*	Nah this place went to shit when they started banning subreddits in the name of becoming appealing to advertiser's, the Pao era is what killed Reddit.
t1_ds6h8sw	0	*	Are you saying they are partisan because they think it will make them more money?  If a socialist/leftist operates a business in a free market does that make them a capitalist?
t1_ds6g6zv	0	*	> Journalism has always been about pushing an agenda.  There have been plenty who have done that, and there also have been plenty committed to truthfully reporting the facts. 
t1_ds6eamf	0	*	No duty according to who?
t1_ds6erin	1	*	Comparing the current POTUS to Hamas is not so far-fetched. He is a hate group unto himself.

t1_dshez06	1	*	If you're required to punch out, you must have at least a 20 minute uninterrupted break relating to work activity.
t1_dsi5fmy	1	*	As a neighbor to the south, I get extra pissed when y'all get shit on cus everyone seems so nice and despite bein like 50 miles away everything seems so nice up there
t1_dsi1zfl	1	*	Oh for sure I'm sure there are some that are awesome to work at. Sorry to hear about her new positions sounds shitty. 
t1_dsi9eyn	1	*	Not really since the entire point of the comment was attempting to invalidate the idea that one needs somewhat deep pockets to get a franchise. Anyone with those assets has pretty deep pockets.
t1_dshok82	1	*	Employees still got a raise. And it's still pocket change...not like they are taking money out of their pocket, it just never gets to their pocket. 
t1_dshushk	0	*	Oh man has the quality ever dropped, you know somethings up when McDicks coffee is worlds better than Timmy Hoes.
t1_dsho16f	0	*	Part of the reason for the cuts is that they are no longer able to use TFW's.
t1_dshbz2g	1	*	Yes, I'm saying that both group are doing what they think is the right thing to support Tim Hortons employees. but what they are doing is basically undermining each other's effort
t1_dshvju3	1	*	I wish I would have known that a while ago
t1_dsjvr7i	1	*	Hiring immigrants isnt outsourcing. 
t1_dshwwi2	1	*	DOL cant amend FLSA because FLSA is a statute. What DOL can do is promulgate regulations under FLSA. 
t1_dsjso3u	0	*	They are certainly part of a group larger than 1%
t1_dsh8o0m	0	*	Then why are you complaining about an overreaction?
t1_dsi6f9j	1	*	That's such a sweet gesture
t1_dshwxez	1	*	We should start trolling their location by sparking up pro-union talk in the store. 
t1_dshppmd	1	*	Some custodians do get tips. 
t1_dsigdzm	1	*	Ice caps and potato wedges. Thats all for me 
t1_dsi1i87	1	*	because unions are cancer.
t1_dshjwrl	1	*	I drive coaches in the UK and getting 2-3 hour paid breaks is pretty sweet :)
t1_dshtevn	1	*	Well, not in Quebec at least. 
t1_dsigomi	1	*	I hear the most retarded shit about unions, albeit in the United States. Some people just completely baffle me with their stupidity.
t1_dshgno0	1	*	Yeah, theyre owned by a variety of people. The managers/staff are usually indian/paki.
t1_dsi2zri	0	*	See, theres this thing called work ethic. Some people have it, some people dont. Its not your fault you werent born with it. It can be learned though. 
t1_dscdpka	0	*	Sure, why else would you make that comment?  A sane person would just leave!

t1_dtvo7m0	0	*	Germany what??  Yes, I know, Reddit is full of idiots who think that EU is an extension of Germany or that the German government is the voice of the EU. 
t1_dtvcd56	1	*	and when the US comes crying to the EU because it loses all its bases in Europe in that case and thus cant project force as well?
t1_dtv501z	1	*	honestly it's easier to forgive them, then the people who live here all their lives and still play stupid... 
t1_dtv0rtx	1	*	It us Germany's 2nd largest source of renewable energy.  Accounting for more than a quarter of the renewable energy production you cited.
t1_dtumo5n	0	*	Yes this would be an accurate statement but doesn't answer for your original statement...
t1_dtwbgj3	0	*	Your information is purely for *physical* goods.  U.S. exports of services to the EU were $231.2 billion in 2016
t1_dtvbk1t	1	*	But the US has been and is contributing an inordinately large amount of emissions compared to its population, so there's a case to be made that it should pay more to help stop emissions.
t1_dtve7rt	0	*	People already understand that pollution is bad despite not signing the agreement.  
t1_dtw7uft	0	*	It's not really dedication if you're being paid for it.
t1_dtvb21v	0	*	Notice your distinct lack of arguments?
t1_dtvkaxc	1	*	Fiat and Chrysler are the same company tho and pretty relevant in the US.
t1_dtx58lu	0	*	You didn't answer the question.
t1_dtvdi9h	0	*	Yes. Because Germany sold them weapons one time, they should do it for all of eternity, never mind social progress, or any other determining factor.
t1_dtul4kq	0	*	Really? You have a link to them saying that? Kind of surprising given how many islands they have that depend on tourism and are impacted by rising sea levels.
t1_dtw214y	0	*	Triggered much?  Wake up.  Europe has become a victim of its own failed policies.  
t1_dtvnsyg	1	*	>deserve  Oh really 
t1_dtvbrfs	1	*	It's like saying we'll just trade with California instead of the USA.  The big thing contains the small thing.

t1_dtngbx1	0	*	Thanks, it's helpful you simply writing you disagree with a fact. Thanks for the contribution, hope it makes you feel great.
t1_dtprxer	1	*	Sure, definitely understand that. 
t1_dsrq4ui	1	*	Some people who did that grew up in comfortable Europe. The worst torturers in IS were and still are of Tunisian origin. Tunisia isn't exactly the worst place in the world.
t1_dsrp26t	0	*	Not to downplay your statement but more then half were above 18. We're they changed s children, most definitely.

t1_dsrq0za	1	*	Boogeyman.
t1_dtv9d5h	0	*	> So its kind of like calling a terrorist, Muslim  When terrorists are Muslim and do what they do in the name of Islam I call them Muslim terrorists.
t1_dtsgueb	1	*	Redditors are generally bad at sarcasm. I think we should get rid of /s to train people in conversational dynamics. 
t1_ducn6d4	1	*	My god I know this comment is 10 days old but I just had to say it was some of the best I have ever read.  I'm only here because I was researching the app.
t1_dsxct10	1	*	[With absolutely no help from known Russian bots at all](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/) /s
t1_dsxce4o	1	*	Mkay, Ivan.
t1_dsro4mv	1	*	You could try being less sarcastic and answer the valid question. Which country is the 'we' referring to?
t1_dsuzrom	0	*	Ah.  Some people in Australia actually wish for the good ol' days of ADSL.  At least it was reliable.
t1_dsv8aye	0	*	You're arguing for a free market and against government regulation... That is why it can't be a free market. Keep up.
t1_dsv4bmy	1	*	No, a Nokia 10DS because my 1200 broke. For security reasons. And the abovementioned house has 100 Mbit/s down, 40 up and people are still happy.

t1_dtqjvbz	1	*	Yikes, they should consider scrubbing that sucker every now and then
t1_dtq44ov	1	*	Turn your face to the sun, child
t1_dtrbg9i	1	*	Originally it is ethnic in basis, but I stand corrected there are a number of converts, and a wave of them more recently in response to ISIS.
t1_dtrfk9y	1	*	Which is how all of Iran's Zoroastrists get the Zoroastrian bit in their passport. 
t1_dtqy3fe	1	*	You're right, not necessarily. I was just pointing out how arbitrary and pointless all the religions are when you place them side by side
t1_dtris57	1	*	Right? I'd like to be the one manning the mirror lasers.
t1_dtrvh94	1	*	Correct. I'm pretty sure that's the case for every country. I don't think an American citizen could get a Visa to travel to the US. They'd tell you to just use your US passport.
t1_dtrvp60	1	*	I would bet that what you described is *technically* against the law in a lot of countries, but it just isn't enforced. I think it's more of a bug than a feature.
t1_dtq4ikr	1	*	Yeah, thanks for pointing that out. I was generalizing a bit and forgot about the nuances, especially when you're dealing with religion.
t1_dtq1ko2	0	*	Iran isn't decimated. It's actually quite a powerful country and also quite well-off by regional standards.
t1_dukk1ox	0	*	Moderates fled to Europe, were killed or surrendered.   Here are some US-backed rebels for you - https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-backed-moderate-rebels-behead-a-child-near-aleppo

t1_duep4jn	0	*	Ehhhh, if you look at Saudi Arabia it doesn't seem like the US really cares what people do with this stuff so long as you're on the administrations good side.
t1_duejovr	1	*	It was the very first NATO chief who characterized its purpose as being chiefly to keep the Russians out and the Germans down. 
t1_dueo94b	0	*	Really don't give a rat's ass what you think. A country that values guns over children's lives is certainly a 3rd world shithole
t1_duesztv	1	*	>so, looks like i created some fake news, i guess :S   You got the upvotes though, which is all that really matters.
t1_dueq4kb	1	*	Shit hole country.  America represents 91% of all first world nations where kids are killed in schools.  Get your fucking house in order. 
t1_dt3s9af	1	*	Crazy talk. Next you're going to tell me that cows aren't perfectly spherical or living in a vacuum. 
t1_dt2jt4d	0	*	You would still be in the same place.  A poor, dumb, lazy guy but then you might realize it's you that causes your situation and not the hard work of the other guy.
t1_dt3wuwf	0	*	Well, it's not really a *poultry* standard. I envision pigs as the new $100 bill. So Turkeys would be what, a $20? 
t1_dt2zfi8	0	*	Death to all Commies. They are just as bad (actually worse in numbers of their own people they killed) as Nazis. 
t1_dud1uhf	1	*	Thanks
t1_ducky2i	1	*	It's not even my joke. I stole it from Bill Maher who was sued for it by Trump. The fact that anyone would try to compare it back to a race thing is beyond me.
t1_duncxdg	0	*	I forgot. In todays society, facts no longer matter as long as it helps advance ones cause.
t1_dun8lga	0	*	If the gun is safely locked away what use will it be when a teacher has to quickly react to a gunman? 
t1_dunrx5z	0	*	Actually he can control a lot of this without congress or the house. Just like how he is banning bump stocks without any approval from the house or senate.
t1_dunc9ph	0	*	It isn't too excuse those shootings? Because it sounds like it.
t1_ds9a7oo	0	*	Man I know Americans suck at geography but this is just embarrassing. 
t1_dueq7xn	0	*	One species loss is another one's gain.
t1_dud9b8w	0	*	So I did remember right, but I was not aware they had been around for a long time. thank you.
t1_dtfhozf	1	*	And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why US political discussion in 2018 is a very difficult thing. You have people, on both sides, that immediately write off the opinions and views of the other side.
t1_du4oubf	0	*	Do you notice the subtle difference between bad things happened and we are doomed the Earth is dying?
t1_dsk3m7t	0	*	Regardless of that being true or not, a president shouldnt outrightly say it, hes supposed to be the fucking president 
t1_dt8rgyj	1	*	oh.. please do.. 
t1_dsc2d4l	0	*	>leftofmarx  Cringe
t1_dsbt6sv	1	*	Thats because the goal was not to obliterate the whole sodding country. If it was, the farmers would have been ashes.
t1_dsbwbru	1	*	No one has quite figured out how to squash an insurgency.  Actual warfare is much different. We won the war against the Iraq army in a matter of days. The trouble is the insurgency. 
t1_dsbtae4	1	*	It's called *Pax Americana*, baby!
t1_dsc3tix	1	*	**If I were**
t1_dsc5rm2	1	*	#MAGA
t1_dsc3gtn	1	*	I'm with you, there is a lot of Murica! and warboners ITT but if you're European I would suggest you jump on the bandwagon seeing as  the US military is practically your military too.
t1_dsbrlfw	1	*	Ships carrying artisanal oxygen?
t1_dsbrzp5	1	*	They have nukes, all the major players do. This would not end well for anyone on the planet.
t1_dsd20gv	0	*	Guess having snacks stashed before drills is something of a must, huh?
t1_dsbxeks	1	*	It could end up being that, of course.
t1_dsbx9ms	1	*	Just remembered a Cold War joke.  Q: what's the definition of a Tactical Nuclear Warhead?  A: anything that lands on Germany
t1_dsbtxzg	1	*	Tactics are for squads. Small groups perform tactics. The generals are operating grand strategy which is a lot of logistics. 
t1_dsc3i7s	0	*	Outside USA people aren't especially obsessed with haikus.
t1_dsc0ul9	1	*	I doubt either side would be in much condition to wave flags at the end of that conflict
t1_dsc2vae	0	*	Just so I'm clear, your position is that stability and unity within the European Union has no bearing on its security? You really don't see what's wrong with that assertion? 
t1_dsc2pfr	1	*	There would be no one left to waive the flag
t1_dsc3o0u	1	*	Seriously, how does someone get to the point where they actually read the sources in a reddit post, but misspell a word like this? I am legitimately confused.
t1_dsbv04b	0	*	You could say the same thing about the USA
t1_dsbotow	1	*	because they carry more boats
t1_dsbuaam	1	*	The baby clothes company also makes tanks? Haha.
t1_dsblevv	0	*	Allow me to help.    Google.com  Then search.    Read  Search again.   Read some more.    Do another search.    It's call research for a reason.  Most of what he said is common knowledge. 
t1_dsbxqke	0	*	Almost positive the guy you're responding to is already talking about Trump, not Merkel.
t1_dsboixv	1	*	It absolutely is true. You have to feed any army or they are useless.
t1_dsbsef2	0	*	What about Russia and China vs NATO? Or Russia and China vs just the US?  I agree with you. Just curious on your thoughts on the above scenarios.
t1_dsbzi7d	1	*	..and now we have found the path to peace.
t1_dsc2lai	0	*	No, i don't remember. Please provide a source for this.
t1_dsc2tmc	1	*	Same with China. 
t1_dsbwv4u	0	*	How far can the aircraft get before it needs to refuel?
t1_dsbqhw4	0	*	That sustainable ~~fortress~~ tomb will run out of fuel eventually. After that, no hydroponics, and everyone starves to death.  Nuclear war kills everyone, no matter how rich.
t1_dsc5oh8	1	*	>Anyone who's read a **western** history book knows Russia is always plotting against Europe lol  Ftfy
t1_dscoec1	1	*	When I lived there they had such a victim complex about the Mongols attacking them...
t1_dsd8arq	1	*	European here. If the US was on the defensive it really could give the rest of the world a fair fight. They have more aircraft carriers than the rest of the world combined.

t1_dsc2aio	0	*	So basically anyone who disagrees with your governments narrative you disregard as a Russian bot, but it's the Russians trying to brainwash you???
t1_dsbteyc	1	*	Yea Russia would be wiped off the planet. 
t1_dsbpk49	1	*	They sell compressed cans of air for electronics cleaning from Port to Port?

t1_dsc0qgh	1	*	You are probably right, i was exaggerating. 
t1_dsccqsu	0	*	You're deranged if you think anyone that disagrees with America's fixation on a dilapidated ex-superpower and its pulp fiction-tier spy rings controlling the white house and beyond is a Russian troll.
t1_dsc0wmh	1	*	I wouldn't say garbage, but it was not nearly as good as the others. 
t1_dsbv0i6	0	*	Add a third and have the alliances reshuffle every 5 years or so. Institutionalised divide & conquer baby! Fuck yeah!
t1_dscn7sz	1	*	Whenever we claim defensive reasons
t1_dsc1qzq	1	*	>implying the US actually wants to win those wars and they aren't just to keep the military working and funded in between larger conflicts
t1_dsbzpf9	0	*	Oh of course, but it's still doubles Denmarks  normal area. - which in itself is 4 X for example, The UK.   Gotta realise for somebody living in Enlgand... most landmasses are 'Massive' ;)
t1_dsbqu3j	1	*	This makes sense to me. Putin and the other military leaders would hole up somewhere and possibly have to watch a couple cities get nuked, but they'd be alive. 
t1_dsbzfk0	1	*	Tbf, the history book should also reflect that Europe has generally speaking also being plotting against Russia. Napoleon and Germany (part 1 and 2) didn't exactly go to play checkers. 
t1_dsbm1jf	0	*	That's bingo.
t1_dsc4qrg	1	*	All im saying is i see alot more comments about russian troll bots than i see comments talking about how great russia and putin is. Battle not with monsters 
t1_dsc75la	1	*	It's not even close. Russia is only good about bombing buildings in Syria.
t1_dsbvoa6	0	*	Well it was the main trade partner back in the USSR days. You are correct to a point, but the road network design certainly benefits logistics planning also.
t1_du7qj6e	1	*	That was a joke. Clearly. 
t1_dsmfro5	0	*	Who?
t1_dsmzwsx	1	*	But that's not what Hawking said, which is the *entire point* of this conversation.
t1_dsnltwi	1	*	Let's hear it for Dunning and Kruger, ladies and gentleman.
t1_dsmpd2e	0	*	Out of curiosity, who are the other 9? And how did you come to that conclusion? Smartness isn't something you can measure. Intelligence comes in many forms.
t1_dsmyap9	1	*	3) Of course you dont, that is the definition of going over your head.
t1_dsnb5cd	1	*	Sorry, missed the /s tag. But I was poking fun at the Google engineer guy who came out with that dissertation on why women are bad engineers.
t1_dv02dtl	0	*	It is as of now, but it won't last. 
t1_duzu91r	1	*	no one cares about white or black violence in africa ya fucken ding dong 
t1_dv05f1w	1	*	Where in South africa are the genocidal towards white people? 
t1_dv05dr6	1	*	I've been to Turkey but not Iran.  How were they different?  I only really liked Turkey when I was with my Turkish friend.  I was harassed quite a bit without her.
t1_dv0nh7w	1	*	It's a very very big place 
t1_dv00mfc	1	*	What does it tell you about the agenda of the media in general?
t1_dv05dt7	1	*	No 99% of the U.S. population is also a result of colonialism. They've actually got to deport most of their population... Not take more in.
t1_dv002t5	1	*	This is the goddamn media, where else do you want it to go?
t1_dv045je	1	*	Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. Those who do study history are doomed to stand helplessly by while others repeat it.
t1_dv00amd	1	*	What is with all the altright idiots here? the agenda of the media? Did you watch too much Alex Jones?
t1_dv023ha	1	*	I was mostly making a joke. I probably would have said the exact same thing if it were CNN or some other American tabloid.
t1_dv00l3d	1	*	Good question. Sadly, I suspect that the answer depends on whether the perpetrators are our allies or not. 
t1_dv06m0v	0	*	Why? because I don't agree with you? support your claims with facts and i'll agree with you. until then you are ignorant and wrong
t1_dv109vf	1	*	It does suck to be a minority
t1_dv087t9	1	*	First, I'm not American. And secondly, that would be like us singing shoot the indian if that was a song from back when we were fighting them.
t1_dv013ap	1	*	I was a bit offended that Fury Road was filmed in Africa since its such an iconic Australian film, but it suddenly makes a lot of sense why it was filmed there.
t1_dv03kr5	1	*	The end of apartheid was only 10 years before 9/11, over half the population was alive and experienced it.
t1_dv04fqc	0	*	.... What?   That's... a lot of conspiracy theory in one place and I don't have the time to pick it apart. 
t1_dv0531l	0	*	why would the french foreign legion be different than any other force?

t1_duzz4du	0	*	YOU read the article. The judge said they are targeted for wealth, not race. Now put this into context with the current article and see that its actually about race! The judge was full of shit
t1_dv09w7h	1	*	No, because whites cannot be victims. /s
t1_dv03s1e	0	*	You can do that but when you leave out important information it makes it seem as if you are misleading people. 
t1_dv00jpe	0	*	Citing a patriarchal society won't help your case.
t1_dv052m8	1	*	Higher education has some pretty retarded and disconnected views about society.   Hating someone for the color of their skin is racist, no matter what race is in power. 
t1_dv065hu	1	*	Venezuela. 
t1_dv0aahj	1	*	I'm a middle-class white South African guy who lives in a suburb just outside a city, nowhere near any farms at all. I'm still pretty concerned though, to be honest.

t1_duzywkn	0	*	Lol. It's White people's fault that Black people still have problems? Lots of poor Asian peoples have seemed to have done just fine for themselves in the face of White Supremacy.
t1_dv0vjge	1	*	I wonder what Die Antwoord think
t1_duzzcfu	1	*	My ancestor was a king, does that mean i can evict everyone in the country and have it all to myself????

t1_dv09f0e	0	*	Im glad you can speak for the whole farming community there.
t1_dv00zvs	0	*	So there's no neo-Nazi racism in Germany or France then? Since Nazis don't control the government or economy, nor do they make up a majority/plurality of the population
t1_dv06cq1	1	*	Don't worry, most people agree with you. This is what right wing brigading looks like lol

t1_duzxugj	1	*	Post-apocalyptic neo-RLI when?
t1_duzxs1n	0	*	Yeah, for communism to come into the picture, many need to die and the population would have to grow over. Capitalism just makes things too efficient.
t1_duzxs3c	0	*	Passed around by rich cunts?  I feel like rich cunts are *exactly* the kind of people who would ignore this quote.

t1_duzzrfp	0	*	Go back to the_dumbass
t1_dv022kj	1	*	So, hey lets *compound* the problem by confiscating white-owned farmland in a half-assed attempt at restitution.   Do you want all out war? Because thats how you get all out war.

t1_dv00r2i	1	*	Who said it was? And why you bring the whole latin america when we are talking about one country in specific?
t1_dv1kv3m	0	*	The Boers are Dutch settler colonists, right? See above about land taken through brutal colonial war. Also, review the the Natives Land Act of 1913. 
t1_dv0fyvg	1	*	It only goes so far, if it gets bad enough you get to Russian revolution stage, that being said I think you are right it can stay in North Korea stage if the situation reaches a steady state.
t1_dv07o6k	0	*	He's African-Canadian but I think he resides in America. California right, geeks?
t1_dv00w5i	0	*	Meh, just returned from South Africa. They are not borderline genocidal there either. In terms of safety it's the same as the US, but less safe than Europe.
t1_dv00a12	0	*	One was violent, and wanted revenge for his fellow Black Africans, wanting white people to carry the sins of their fathers.  The other was much more humanitarian. 
t1_duzys6q	1	*	Welcome to the side of reading articles reddit likes to ignore. 
t1_dv01u10	0	*	The default is distrust.  One incident and its tit for tat and demoralisation/dehumanisation until the end.  You can see we came from chimps and not Orangutans.
t1_dv05ndh	1	*	It's still a retarded thing to say. You honestly believe black people can't be racist towards white people here in the states? Because if you agree with her that's exactly what you're saying.
t1_dv02ae0	1	*	The amount of murder involved, generally. 
t1_duzzvth	0	*	Yep, am Kiwi and when I lived in a tourist town a lot of visitors thought I was from Seth Erfika.
t1_duzyef7	1	*	They weren't even riding high with $120.00 a barrel, they were breaking even. You don't see Russia, Norway, Trinidad, Mexico, or the Arabs suffering in the same way as Venezuela.
t1_dv159ov	0	*	You ARE the ones who voted Donald J Trump to the position of one of the worlds most powerful men. That says something. I don't know what, but something.
t1_duzxspi	1	*	Dumb.

t1_dv00tja	1	*	Wow, you're an idiot. 
t1_dv01g0x	1	*	So lets be clear, you're blaming this guy's decision on American colonialism? Considering that argument a stretch would be generous.
t1_dv013p8	1	*	If I meet a group of people in an alley that want to hurt me because of my color, that is racist. It doesn't matter who is in control of the country.   Racism is racism

t1_dv03utr	0	*	I was actually confused when I learned that white people only make up 5% of south Africa's population. Tv and movies definitely skew it to have more white people. 
t1_duzxy3u	1	*	Who cares about their considerations?
t1_duzym8k	0	*	The left does not have the monopoly on making up new definitions for words. The right redefined the word fact to mean whatever bullshit is spewing out of their collective maws at the time. 
t1_dv01qvt	1	*	Idk man. I'm liberal, I understand and believe in the oppression of many minorities here in the US, but she took that and fucking jumped off the cliff with it.

t1_duzxr9j	0	*	Ok but a lot of living white South Africans had a lot to do with perpetuating Apartheid, my grandmother included. 
t1_dv2ftls	0	*	Yes, that's exactly my opinion.  Sorry, I meant 96% white.

t1_dt7lbgm	1	*	If it is even only about your history, shouldn't you be learning about colonial history. That's probably *the* most relevant part for the UK.
t1_dt7avg1	1	*	I agree there are portions of the population that think this, but at this point a large part of NK knows there is more to the world than what dear leader tells them.

t1_dt6xw2m	0	*	Your comment saidRight now , not 70 years ago so... No it's not historically accurate to say the only reason is the US/Russia conflit is the only thing stopping reunification right now.
t1_dt7cg45	1	*	Yup, people assume it's as simple as adding .5 Koreas together into one Korea. Even defectors take years to adapt to their new world, now imagine that with ~25 million people.
t1_dt93qyt	1	*	Yeah I'm from Massachusetts. It would be preeeety different.

t1_dsq95oc	0	*	Noone?

t1_dus5mo7	0	*	There is no 'hatered towards immigrants' its the RWNJ, Fascists and Russian trolls dividing the West.
t1_dus974r	1	*	It's a good point you bring up, it would be really hard to be homeless in Syria, but that has to be preferable to being bombed.  Apparently they're not being allowed to leave.

t1_dusc15l	1	*	In Europe, 100 mils is a long distance; in the US, 100 years is a long time. 
t1_dutxd4k	1	*	> rebels  You misspelled Al Qaeda. 
t1_dus22kz	0	*	Which is because the majority of the people who claim they are from syria can't even speak the language.
t1_dus8zlx	1	*	Thanks.. Well, if things would be like this in any european country, most people would flinston the hell out of there
t1_dusbg06	1	*	Don't apologize, I think we're pretty glad of that.

t1_dt5x9he	0	*	No, its a tariff that protects a few uncompetitive American sugar producers that causes the problem. I have no problem with corn growing handouts.
t1_dt5d55o	0	*	No. I hoped Trump would be a good president. Like he said, he could shoot someone in the street and you'd still follow him to hell.

t1_dsd71ia	1	*	Side note: we still don't know if these are actually acoustic attacks. No one has any idea or evidence but this seems like it could be possible.

t1_dtwq98c	1	*	Maybe if it's worth creating an international incident over this hacker (ohnoes) individual, spending a modest amount of human resources setting up a secure computer is not much in comparison, hmm?

t1_dux8aow	0	*	Are you being sarcastic or not? Do we really need to ask?!?!?!  
t1_duxm6o4	1	*	So doesn't that mean they chose this path?
t1_duy51vq	1	*	actually, Iran has a central establishment, so Shia can be called orthodox religion (in contrast to orthopraxy Sunni Islam). i believe this is what made them capable to create a modern nation state.
t1_duxichj	1	*	No fuck you! BUZZWORDS! /s

t1_dtkt2i4	0	*	Our country is losing its shit because our PM took a helicopter ride from a rich guy once.
t1_dtkwmy3	1	*	That's simply not true. Top 1% contribute 45% of the taxes and got 87% of the tax cut.   And inheriting $11 million from Daddy is not success. 
t1_dtkvfcx	1	*	CU gave corporations the same rights that unions already had. If corporations can't spend money on political ads, then neither should unions be allowed to.

t1_duxhscj	1	*	I'm not sure joining capitalism is the answer. That causes it's own huge problems too.   I wouldn't describe the UK or US governments as good. I'm not even sure I'd describe them as democratic.

t1_dv09khz	0	*	Guaranteed paid vacations? are you a communist? *idea gets shut down because committing to it is political suicide*  The more i read about US politics the more .. idiotic and oligarchic it seems.
t1_dv1sea0	1	*	Some non-office workers certainly are. An example from Taiwan. Its slowly changing but apparently a lot of tour bus drivers work 14-16 hour days. https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3096538

t1_du4f7go	0	*	The fricking article we are discussing here >_>'
t1_du4lsad	0	*	Defining how many bitcoins can be created isn't equal to regulation.   Pump and dumps are so easy to do, and there's literally nothing that can be done about it without regulation.

t1_du3xfib	0	*	tell me how exactly can you pay rent with an offline wallet? or are you just treating bitcoin like some shitty digital gold which you'll sell when the time is right
t1_du3xgj3	1	*	It sounds like you profited in USD (or your local currency) due to the speculative nature of bitcoin and paid your rent in fiat not bitcoin.

t1_dsn6lnp	0	*	You say this like you're under the impression the US isn't using software to spy on other countries.   There is no 'hostile attack' there is perpetual passive attacks from all sides.

t1_dtnmdwl	1	*	Ehmen
t1_dtnd18f	1	*	And we know how Trump likes his waterboarding, the guy has a legitimate concern. Guess he should have thought about that before he started his hackathon. 
t1_dtnuv00	1	*	Literally moving the goal posts with every sentence,  'pede
t1_dtnxv59	1	*	Nice
t1_du9532i	0	*	Agreed.  The issue is the notion that guns solve problems.  This is glorified in so many ways.  Guns and this notion tend to morph

t1_dtio4pl	1	*	Sure, I agree with all of that. That's why I said peacefully. If I can't take a drug and be peaceful then I shouldn't take the drug. Like, if I can't drive safely on alcohol, then I shouldn't drive.
t1_dtinr5a	0	*	Yes but is making it techically legal to use drugs going to make it any better? I'm just doubtful of this method.

t1_ds12thq	0	*	Hot take. 
t1_ds1bbz4	0	*	The problem with such a strong deterrent is that it means you can also be aggressive against your neighbours and nobody will do much.  See: Russia in Crimea, Ukraine.

t1_ds15avr	1	*	THAAD is useless against ICBMs - the only defense against those that we have is the GMB system.

t1_dse4fks	1	*	In a lot of places they are and that's where those people live. Go to maine or something and as a person there and they will probably give you a far smaller number.
t1_dsfdv8t	1	*	That number is rapidly rising. There are many tens of thousands more than even two years ago. It probably depends on the country but at least in the Netherlands most of them work
t1_dsezf19	1	*	He specifically talks about Hungary not accepting refugees, gives reasons why and places it in context regarding the current events in Europe. 
t1_dseokxd	0	*	Oh son, we know exactly why Euros don't track religious affiliation (actually, plenty of European countries still do, including the UK).  Also I'm not even close to being American.

t1_dsqluok	1	*	The has/have mistake is almost unnoticeable in comparison. Mostly because our brain just corrects it for us.
t1_dsqluoz	1	*	Trust me, there are no countries that are full of people like you, I promise.
t1_dsqck3i	1	*	user name somewhat checks out
t1_dsq7kfy	0	*	Southern Indiana, in the heart of Trump country. The Trumpism here is palpable. 
t1_dsq91hz	1	*	Most Americans dont have a passport and have never and never plan on leaving the country.   Yeah I was just making the point the eu is almost the way the us is with passportless boarder crossings. 
t1_dsqyo9r	1	*	Nah, in fact I've kept many details for myself for privacy reasons. All of that and more happened. Maybe you have fun making such stuff up.
t1_dsr7t39	1	*	Yea, damned Americans never had counts, lords, earls. What a bunch of losers. Needs more feudalism to be interesting.
t1_dsqmzfx	1	*	This exactly.
t1_dsqbwt2	0	*	Travel bans.
t1_dtk25qo	1	*	You should see some of the comments directed at Arabs literally every day of the year

t1_ds580kw	1	*	I didnt even mention the UN.
t1_dtkurip	0	*	Most people I know streamed it. I would think the number of people watching is much higher because of this. Higher than 60 something million, not sure.
t1_dt9o8kq	0	*	> and the EU have been retrenching since WWII.   ?????
t1_dt9de1c	0	*	What soul?
t1_dtcec0w	1	*	me too, that's why i asked him.

t1_dthbr7w	0	*	Hamas and their death to America chants and support for terrorism.
t1_dth9cea	0	*	And that has worked out so well for palestine, such a thriving country...

t1_dthrunq	1	*	Thanks!
t1_duxw1bx	1	*	this is not my area of expertise but as a tax payer i would be happy to foot the bill for two camels leaving a circus.  
t1_ds3zp20	1	*	This article backs up DrDaniels comments. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/middleeast/iran-protests-khamenei.html
t1_duivf7q	1	*	You can't vote at 18. You're forced to defend the country though! (if you have a penis)
t1_duivbwg	0	*	How does it work, then? Because equalization doesn't jibe with handing out money to citizens due to surplus.
t1_duidsmx	1	*	Canal, they don't have any natural rivers on the main part of Singapore.
t1_duiztzw	1	*	Yep
t1_dujdyfz	1	*	Oh sweet I can afford a house in Melbourne now?
t1_duinqxw	1	*	You are not completely correct about this one, friend.
t1_duio0xz	1	*	Dem parachutes.
t1_dsqav2k	0	*	Just like the US never armed Iran, they sold weapons to Israel who then illegally sold them to Iran. wink wink. 
t1_dts9i46	0	*	It's so silly how you just dismiss it as madness. Just look at alcohol prohibition in the US and the rise of organized crime. It's the same for drugs.
t1_dttvexk	1	*	And the army is just as corrupt, but more incompetent than the state police. 
t1_dtssycn	0	*	Neccisitas un accento. Si means if, Sxed is yes.

t1_dtt70e9	1	*	who's being paid? moi? lol i fucking wish.
t1_dtqwxnh	0	*	The navy is one of the most important delivery systems in a nuclear war.  Land-based missile launches are more easily detected than ones from subs.

t1_dtnz072	1	*	Um, or the fact they are literally our *closest* ally...
t1_dtodjmp	1	*	It might be a joke on the trainers part. They make us do our own training for stuff and it gets dry as fuck. Id guess this guy slipped that in somewhere because he was being a smart ass.
t1_dto7rl9	1	*	Pull over and pull out 
t1_dto7rne	0	*	pussy
t1_dto5jcb	0	*	Even then, Mattis wouldn't just sit by and let an attack on Canada happen.
t1_dtoawxc	0	*	I wish that existed lol. Anyone who has both has the best of both worlds 
t1_dto0dm4	0	*	There's no such thing as just nuking the U.S. that would just lead to a world wide nuclear war. No world leader no matter how insane wants the entire planet destroyed.
t1_dtnyiwy	0	*	War, war never changes.
t1_dtoc17p	1	*	My RDC called making it rain.
t1_dto6n2d	1	*	Thats a damn good attitude. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
t1_dto6h5u	1	*	Oh, you went through harsh military training to learn how to shoot? We find this shit fun!
t1_dtodafh	1	*	We just really love Canada and would be happy to ruin somebodys day if they made you cry. 
t1_dtnxxrj	1	*	Aah! The good ol /r/worldnews baseless extrapolation about hypothetical situations that serve no purpose whatsoever.
t1_dtnza3v	1	*	Jock strap?
t1_dto4nvg	1	*	Last year Germany could only field 8 working aircraft for a while.
t1_dtodc4l	1	*	We didnt steal it. [It finally decided to move to Canada!](https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/canada/century-old-u-s-landmark-blows-into-new-brunswick-from-maine-1.3756467) 
t1_dto88tk	1	*	You're forgetting about NORAD and NATO.
t1_dtodnon	0	*	Because NATO countries/allies in the Baltics share more than one border with Russia. Canada is a part of NATO.  Kind of hard to avoid. 
t1_dtnv2f1	1	*	When you don't have anything of value to add so you just make generic insults
t1_dto20bp	0	*	The thing is I'm sure people were trying to be diplomatic in every other conflict.  
t1_dtou4nv	1	*	Quite literally the only logical option.   Unless maybe greenland is our dildo.
t1_dtoabov	1	*	true....and?  Russia can do the same  exactly that's why US can  > beat the shit out of anyone  except  Russia
t1_dtny16v	0	*	Fucking Scotland.
t1_dto8du4	0	*	China alone in 25 years will have the capability to invade the US         LOL
t1_dtoawxp	1	*	Thats the narrative here in America, but our current foreign policy would look very different if that were actually true. Were still fighting the Russians in the Syrian proxy war, for example. 
t1_dtokssl	0	*	The accounts we have says surrounding them. So we in the absence of other evidence must assume thats true. 
t1_dtodto9	0	*	I'm Canadian. And i'm sorry.
t1_dtoc3h9	1	*	Maritimer for life, woo hoo!
t1_dtof8vy	1	*	Oh fuck off. This is just stupid.
t1_dtofkcu	1	*	Great joke
t1_dspgkew	1	*	Thats because they decided not to fight the Iraqi army, who basically surprised them and imo betrayed them after they saved the country from ISIS.
t1_du87onj	1	*	When Walmart employees have to go on foodstamps then they probably can't afford to even shop at Walmart.   Uneducated masses don't have the disposable income to be a reliable consumer.
t1_du87q5k	0	*	I can't wait for babyboombers to die: they are easily the worst generation the world had seen; fantastically entitled and profoundly privileged... the sooner they're dead the better. 
t1_dua8d5m	1	*	not really, it was a way for me to say that blaming everything on the government doesn't work
t1_du8e1dj	1	*	It's because of the old fallacy that states that public domain is susceptible to corruption but private isn't because it's your personal interest.
t1_du8owrr	0	*	So you're in favor of a flat tax?  That is indeed the most theoretically 'fair' taxation method, but critics will say it disproportionately targets lower income individuals. 
t1_du89pt8	1	*	Chill with the chills, bro.
t1_du83uqx	0	*	Can't the rule be, once you go past a million dollar revenue, you get taxed to revenue? Although that screams law of unintended consequences. 
t1_du89x5w	1	*	Thanks guys for letting me in on what our political structure actually is like. I have never really quite put it together before but reading your replies has let in on a lot, thanks.
t1_du99e1e	1	*	Let's not forget NBN either, which is a lot of money down the drain (billions) due to the fuckuppery by the libs.
t1_du84i0r	1	*	How would you even prove that you were unemployed?
t1_du887v7	1	*	North-America is best America!
t1_du8aq9b	1	*	Just like the incentives offered to companies to stay in country, there need to be penalties against companies that pack up and still expect to do business with those of the country.
t1_du86kvk	0	*	If a platypus shanks you with its spur, also venomous. 
t1_du8rcl4	1	*	Hell of a non-statement ya got there
t1_du8a51l	1	*	Maybe for complicated strategies like shell companies and off-shoring.  But carry-forward lose and depreciation make total sense.  
t1_du83kts	0	*	The thread title seems to disagree with you about what they have paid.
t1_du82sho	1	*	At least you're in the right location for a Mad Max apocalypse
t1_du87qoh	0	*	Yup, it's totally normal that these multi-billion dollar companies are not paying taxes.  That's literally the point of my post.
t1_du840rk	1	*	All I can hear when I read this is that we are wealthy.
t1_du8dzby	0	*	Then would just get people to spend the money they would on taxes on rent instead.
t1_du8b92d	0	*	I'm not nitpicking, just explaining something perhaps you don't want to understand. I'm sure you'll love socialism...
t1_du81n73	0	*	Because companies do not pay employees all of their money, a huge chunk of it goes into profits or other investments or offshore accounts.
t1_du84l85	0	*	We see one more pirate copy of House Husbands and we invade the fuck out of you.
t1_du8c341	0	*	 Indeed
t1_du89z3z	1	*	Their workers dont pay income tax either?
t1_du84iot	1	*	Stop the boats
t1_du89rkt	1	*	Not just the consumers, but the consuwomens and consuchildens too.
t1_dttgzee	1	*	Nice one, thank you!
t1_dtve57n	0	*	What?
t1_dtvr3zb	1	*	It's not that they changed it. It's why they changed it that matters. 
t1_dt57sxh	1	*	Well more likely we would just buy from another country that uses slave labor at a slightly higher cost. Prices would have to get pretty high before we moved everything back to th US. 
t1_dt549jg	1	*	The Chinese hurt their customers, why can't we? Brilliant thinking!
t1_ds833pe	0	*	The same goes for you, where did you read that men work longer? Do you have a reputable source for such a accusation?
t1_ds81a5p	1	*	No, women are not inferiror to men; however on aberage women work less than men and this will on average be paid less. This is the obvious rebbutal to the whole wage gap myth.
t1_dtark4b	0	*	But... it could be? I mean the whole thing about soldiers being the buffer on the nukes because they could say no. I don't see this situation as being much different.
t1_dtbfcf0	1	*	The PKK has killed more Kurds in the last 30 years than the Turkish government.
t1_duht1vv	1	*	Probable cause exists in almost every country actually.

t1_dv540vh	0	*	We have much better precision munitions now with satellite guided GPS.
t1_du3ugql	0	*	How is that even fair though, just further divides rich and poor
t1_dufppa4	0	*	Monopolies work very well. That is why private businesses   complain like hell that they are unfair and cannot compete when the government has them.
t1_duaqch8	0	*	As I recall the H and N are proteins present in the flu virus and the numbers are variants on how they interact with the immune system when theyve infected a person. 
t1_duaean9	1	*	Please get a job
t1_duagmku	1	*	You would also have to look at, age, health, and the type of health care someone received. 
t1_dubd7dv	1	*	> quotidian  via Old French from Latin quotidianus, earlier cotidianus, from cotidie daily.
t1_dua6yf2	1	*	Lol
t1_ds1c9lw	1	*	And FYI, no we don't really hate you. We find you lot rather amusing. You are a sideshow unto yourself. Superpower by 2020 amirite? ;)
t1_dsqm4dv	1	*	I didn't mean they use it to get military votes. They use the military to get patriot votes. 
t1_duqq60a	0	*	Well seeing as he rapes just the one girl but then saves her family and extended family...technically he does save more than he rapes.
t1_duq13o8	1	*	Well it's not actively prostituting it's citizens so that's something...  Plus the whole not being a nation-level prison-cult thing.
t1_durh4vy	0	*	Oh, glad to hear that. It's okay then.  
t1_duq6ozn	1	*	But not too much in case they get fat 
t1_duq3462	0	*	Probably the same people praising Kim Jong Un's sister
t1_dur9fzt	0	*	South Korea's a lot better than its non-capitalist counterpart.
t1_duq93lq	1	*	Yeah. I'm not saying that you said that, just that people should get more proof before getting the pitch forks out.
t1_dur2s3a	0	*	This is what an actual fascist looks like. 
t1_duqwj2z	1	*	It's better to question new information than accept it because it sounds believable.
t1_dupxsx9	0	*	Since youre trying so hard to defend North Korea then you should just go there. Im sure theyd love to have you.
t1_dv2o8n1	1	*	You want Skynet? Because this is how you get Skynet. 
t1_dv2lvd8	0	*	What's a good education defined as, though?
t1_dv2m2wo	1	*	There's a Hillary email thread literally stickied in td right now
t1_dv2otxa	0	*	Isnt this just a response to China dumping steel for years without any retribution.  The WTO allows for tariffs - this is nothing new.
t1_dv2nle8	1	*	Yea, but the fake unemployment went down quite dramatically under Obama.
t1_dv36q69	1	*	I agree.  Some of my countrymen have been brainwashed by certain media companies (cough Fox News cough).  I really have no idea why how it all happened, but it definitely started before i was born.
t1_dv2o52l	0	*	It would be if it wasn't in reference to the billionaire president of the richest nation in the world. He's not stupid - and the fact that people think he is...is terrifying.
t1_dv2nl1u	0	*	North Korea's regime hasn't had any meaningful impact on the United States.  The GOP's policies have. 
t1_dv2vyhl	1	*	Proximity, logistics, and capacity. In New England for instance there is much more capacity for Canadian steel mills near Montreal to produce and deliver steel than on this side of the boarder. 
t1_dv2v6m1	1	*	I agree insofar as I think a lot of Dems have been a joke (see: Berniemania) but if you're implying that Republicans have been paragons of rational discourse, I would have to laugh at that.
t1_dv2hx51	0	*	I comment therefore I am. 
t1_dv2q1ha	1	*	hey cuz fuck the great lakes region 
t1_dv2rvd0	0	*	BullHANST!  The russia sanctions are specifically targeted at individual russian oligarchs, ya silly.
t1_dv354hr	1	*	I'm thinkinh thats a wise move.
t1_dv2s9wl	1	*	Considering more Americans voted for Hillary, having more americans vote wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.
t1_dv2mm00	0	*	I don't know - sounds like he may have helped Erik Prince with a little insider information: https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/969448197360939008
t1_dv2v4ey	1	*	Huh, who would ever like to see the entire western hemisphere suffer, and more importantly become less powerful?  Certainly not our snowy vodka polar bear overlords.
t1_dv2lupb	0	*	Ireland? Canada? 
t1_dv2owoe	0	*	That's what she said.
t1_dv2p2h8	1	*	I'll allow it., but I think she's actually Slovenian and not actually sleeping with him.

t1_dv2ovr9	0	*	Am libertarian, fuck him for... well shit, there's so many reasons you can honestly pick your own

t1_dv353fs	1	*	well shit, might just go back in.
t1_dv2u8bd	0	*	The NATO relationships that Trump is so strongly in favor of...? 
t1_dv35s1m	1	*	I dont see that happening again for two reasons:  1. He constantly touts the economy and we are do for a recession.  2. He cant run as anti establishment
t1_dv2qplm	1	*	The Electoral College failed in their almost singular duty to keep a populist, moronic criminal out of the White House.
t1_dv2wib1	0	*	ELI5 what the same thing is over six different presidential administrations (30 years) and what do we need to change?
t1_dv2s609	1	*	Yeah say it to all those Bernie voters in the midwest too. 
t1_dv2oj9b	1	*	I mean as a person from Indiana (where he caused an AIDS epidemic) my opinion isn't very high on him.
t1_dv2rv0w	1	*	Half Life 3 confirmed. 
t1_dv2ni23	1	*	Then, their child should mate with a computer from a fast food chain and produce babies that can automate tasks like working the cash register and ordering food.  ...Wait a minute.
t1_dv2nqoe	0	*	What's the status of the Scottish independence movement?
t1_dv2tqtl	0	*	None. Thats not how markets work.
t1_dv2txvq	1	*	Because poor conservatives here, especially the most entitled ones, are actually arrogant retards. There's no pretending, they are what they show themselves to be.
t1_dv2npjy	0	*	Lmfao ok buddy
t1_dv2pnwb	0	*	Because he said dude

t1_dv2seka	0	*	two wrongs don't make a right.  they lost the entire federal government to the terrible republicans.  It means the democrats need reforms.

t1_dv2xdxc	0	*	Nope.  Just keep your head in the sand buddy.
t1_dv2npcv	1	*	It's hard to take you seriously when you call her a bitch. It's a sexist insult that undermines any point you were trying to make.
t1_dv2ps5k	0	*	Yes, hodl in situations like this.
t1_dv2o6ht	1	*	Trumples tilts kin.
t1_dv2qap1	1	*	You can't handle the truth!
t1_dv2r1b6	1	*	well, it makes sense because he's simple.  trade wars after all, are easy to win, when you just declare you've won regardless of the truth.
t1_dv2oscy	1	*	Does a downvote close the windows of heaven?
t1_dv2g4yr	1	*	We all know that a booming stock market has never ever led to anything bad before. what could possibly be wrong with using the markets as a barometer to the health of your economy..
t1_dv2prag	0	*	My only hope that they are rats fleeing a sinking ship.
t1_dv2pxlz	1	*	If only there was some way to trade this steel freely.
t1_dv44f7x	1	*	They're not eating the cost. They're making America great again.
t1_dv2qd7h	0	*	Yes that's the reason Trump is supporting it, but why do regular conservative people support it? A lot of the time I feel like they support things simply because they are told to

t1_dv2pz6m	1	*	Chinese steel represent only 3 %
t1_dudo102	1	*	To be fair, the native people in America were not organized or densely centered in the same way that these civilizations were. Softer, smaller, less dramatic purges were just as effective.

t1_dudoe59	0	*	Its only been a recent development and also there may still be an age gap.   In elementary school in the 90's I was still taught how Columbus discovered America and was, paraphrasing, a good guy. 
t1_dudky4i	0	*	B....because of aliens?
t1_dudqnsn	1	*	I thought it was Itzcoatl, rather than Montezuma, who went and re-wrote Aztec history.

t1_dv4sg2q	1	*	Bidets for the win! 
t1_dtvbzvn	1	*	Correct me if I am wrong, but countries with Continental Law systems (like Germany) don't have juries. Therefore there'd be no jury  nullification in such places.

t1_dtug2kk	0	*	I Don't think they've actually done anything yet despite taking this stance pretty much since they took office. I could be wrong.  Note: They referring to sessions/trump

t1_dt36318	0	*	Ah, yes, a good reminder why I stopped using Reddit...
t1_dt2l374	1	*	They shouldn't.  No Bible author wrote anything down to be some peer-reviewed piece of investigative journalism.  They wrote it down for an audience, and approximated when necessary.
t1_dt2mhp6	1	*	I think the question is less, was there a Big Bang, but rather accepting that theory, what caused it? And why?
t1_dt319ig	0	*	I believe in the beginning of existence around 14 billion years ago where everything that is started from a single point and is continually expanding outward.
t1_dt2prgt	1	*	Huh?  Not sure what you're getting at.  I'm just saying that you can take a literal interpretation of the Bible and not believe in a young Earth.

t1_dt2o0or	1	*	We accept that God uses figurative language to describe the end of Time, it shouldnt be a surprise if God was using figurative language to describe the beginning of Time. 
t1_dt2n7at	1	*	So many parts of the Bible are parables and stories that likely aren't 100% literal.   Jesus spoke in parables often.
t1_dt2pc2z	1	*	Not who you were asking, but doesn't Genesis contain two creation stories anyway? Doesn't seem like they could both be literally true. But I'm no expert. Like, not at all. Just joining in.

t1_dtf9wth	0	*	That's completely subjective. Not an argument.
t1_dt2m3ke	1	*	Ask the same question two different ways.   If you get different answers, then throw that survey out.   Polling is surprisingly serious business. It's hard. 
t1_dt2p7hc	1	*	like if it's a drug abuse survey, there's a question asking if you've ever used derbisol. if you have, it's thrown out. 
t1_dt2out1	1	*	The famous do you think Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer question is one that somehow got its results released.  Anyone who said yes or I don't know had their answers thrown out

t1_dtqwds6	1	*	Yes, it certainly is in some Third World countries.
t1_du5u902	1	*	Agreed on the general point.  Peer review has, IMO, lost much credibility with the invasion of campus leftist indoctrination.
t1_dtqnhba	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about? We don't pay for public school? And none of those things are indicators of a the value of your education? 
t1_dtqv22e	1	*	> The US is just as bad as Mexico in that regard.  How can you be this delusional?
t1_dtr8k7y	0	*	Coming in as a refugee is vastly different from coming in as an immigrant, we came in when Chretien was running the show, having an education was a requirement regardless as to where you come from.
t1_dtqmmvv	1	*	Probably from Fraser Institute 
t1_dtrz5yp	1	*	I was implying that America is a shithole country lol. The original post was sarcasm but I refuse to use the /s tag. 
t1_dtqycca	1	*	When discussing immigration to US, it is important to keep in mind the country of origin of the immigrant. Time to get PR can be very different based on country of origin.
t1_dtqymjn	0	*	Theres more eyes on US immigration and that policy would be considered racist somehow. Thats why. 
t1_dtqs1n8	0	*	Small hint: there is a world outside of Canada.  If you really believe that there are poor people in Canada, then you have not seen anything.
t1_dtqxk4h	0	*	But most of them will be sent back to wherever they came from. Just because they arrive and claim refugee status doesn't mean they are actual refugees.
t1_dtqyufm	1	*	So, the country should be tearing itself apart any day now, right? /s
t1_dtqz728	0	*	That's literally the system we have in the US already... Canada modeled their system after ours.
t1_dtqrfmy	1	*	When did I say that?  Do you usually lie on the internet and put words in peoples' mouths?
t1_dtr17jo	0	*	In all seriousness hough, Canada and the US have the same rank on the [Human Development Index.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index#2016_Human_Development_Index)
t1_dtr8g3y	1	*	Foreign workers as in TFWs or new Canadians? Humungous difference.  To me, foreign workers, would not include immigrants, since they are not technically, foreigners, anymore, but rather new Canadians.
t1_dtsmj66	1	*	I will pay that.. As an Australian it's hard for me to hear all domestic news about the guy. For sure he is a gigantic twat but the amount people go on about him just because he is Trump astounds me.
t1_dtqedd5	1	*	It's pretty shite though atm
t1_dtr0fyd	0	*	The alt right is the new boogie man. They are everywhere...but I hardly see them. Like forest Gump looking for Charlie. 
t1_dtr8ytm	1	*	Moreso, tax raised from the rich newcomers can be spent on the poor newcomers. That's the idea, anyway.
t1_dtqczl4	1	*	Refugees from the US?   Thing is..there were rules here in North America. 
t1_dtxbycn	1	*	Your rationale is inconsistent, and indecipherable. You seem to be merely argumentative.
t1_dtqeamw	1	*	**I LIVE IN A SHITHOLE!!**
t1_dtqxjtw	0	*	Oh no, how sad.
t1_dtqcts9	0	*	> uncontrolled migration  Could you explain what you mean by this? Canada definitely has controls on refugee migration as it does for other immigration.
t1_dtqz7ds	1	*	Denmark isnt letting the right people in. 
t1_dtr15e3	0	*	Only 9.4 percent have a higher education certificate 
t1_dtqdoxy	0	*	Yup. Dude is gross.
t1_duq6bfg	0	*	I dont appreciate your tone sir. this mentality would be fine for anyone else. but this was his job. This is the exact reason he was there. He got paid for this, and he did nothing.
t1_dt9sryt	0	*	i use whats up for that. 
t1_dt9ujet	1	*	George Bush as well. Both the one who lied about WMDs and the one who groped a 16 year old are your friends now.
t1_dtal4sw	0	*	What does it feel like having a third party analyzing and occasionally censoring all of your private communications?
t1_dt9utfq	1	*	Did I miss something? Did that guy say anything pro-Trump? 
t1_dt968ug	1	*	If it takes more than the useless flap they should be held liable and sued, done and done
t1_dt9ieno	1	*	So the sum of what you're saying is that --  Religious views do not constitute the mutilation of a infant's genitalia as it is torture.
t1_dt9gy91	0	*	Right, there's gotta be some deeply buried issues inside me, it's not that you're a fucking prick? 
t1_dt9talc	1	*	Have you ever watched a circumcision? If not, shut your trap. 
t1_dtrz88x	1	*	Sounds good.
t1_du4e39z	0	*	>That's a tad naive, when their revenue comes from selling your personal data.  This is 100% bullshit. 
t1_du76dfg	0	*	Thats what you do when selling property, if possible you sell for more than its worth.
t1_du7eeyx	1	*	Lol doesnt read the article and apparently doesn't care.  He's literally shilling for free
t1_du7nnxx	0	*	[Wide margin.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2016/statemap1024.png) Remember, it is the states that vote for President, not the people. 
t1_dtsm454	1	*	This makes all the other answers so much better 
t1_dtsirpr	1	*	no its just a meme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ8zDpX2Mg
t1_dubz1xu	1	*	At this point it seems like that might be the best plan. 
t1_dspmqkk	1	*	Why single out Japan then, to make it sound like they're the only country that does this?
t1_dteikdx	1	*	These selfish fucks will get divine justice for sure.
t1_dsfb1gc	1	*	I wouldnt attack you but I definitely consider you my enemy.
t1_dsf6gcx	0	*	No, but it does mean you don't get to complain when the other side does the exact same thing you've been doing for years.
t1_du1zju6	1	*	Previous Presidents would have accepted blame.  Such as President Truman
t1_dugrlr3	1	*	Israel is at war with Syria, they can go in whenever they want. Syria should surrender unconditionally if they want that to stop, eventually.
t1_dufum21	0	*	It's a reference to Arabs...
t1_du35ngz	0	*	For the country with the second/third largest oil reserves that's pretty good, especially when you consider the other two. Especially since that measure isn't even exclusively oil. 
t1_ds3m3l5	0	*	we really don't care what americans think
t1_dun2xap	1	*	To be fair to Pence the rule is a good one due to the current state of politics. Theres things to hate Pence about, but covering his ass in this way isn't one of them. 
t1_dulrjr6	0	*	>Im not saying people arent complicated. And Im not saying he was an evil guy. Im just saying he did a lot of pretty deplorable things in his day.  Sure, I agree with that.
t1_dtmr8fq	0	*	That is impressive! I'd buy a lottery ticket if I were you!
t1_dt2l6rd	1	*	you can post links, you know .. until then .. I call this bullshit 
t1_dsfxxzk	0	*	Pssst...Russia pretty much goaded North Korea to attack South Korea back in 1950.  It was all Russian equipment used, too... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_in_the_Korean_War 
t1_dtp2ujv	1	*	> I actually never stated my position.  Yes you did. Or are you now going to deny that you're a denier?
t1_dv68pq9	1	*	It's the court of public opinions. Not sure that matters. It is important to have the discourse, though.
t1_dv4ztmr	0	*	it's eerie how you can know precisely what that soldier saw from a reverse angle, from behind his fellow soldiers from a distance of at least 15metres 
t1_dv42qwe	1	*	So is using a baby as a sheild. Or taking a baby to a protest.
t1_dv4l9e5	1	*	Let me understand this. You want the target of a stun grenade to be looking at you before you throw it?
t1_dv4n7tk	1	*	Pure, blessed freedom. 
t1_dv4lid8	1	*	The other thing. 
t1_dv45cv8	0	*	Omg.. they werent opening fire. Did you see them shoot their rifles? Also apparently the footage is taken out of context since these Israelis were under attack themselves before. 
t1_dv73t3k	1	*	King David Hotel Bombing. Jewish terrorism started Israeli and Jewish terrorists became leaders. Israel is a rogue state and not even the Assads and Saddam at their worst compare to them.
t1_dv4qsdc	0	*	A fragmentation grenade is different than a flashbang. Stop arguing semantics.
t1_dstmrag	0	*	I'm pretty sure they were saying that it's unacceptable that this happen to anyone, not that all people and governments of the world view these things as unacceptable.
t1_dsu6mn0	0	*	I'm seeing a pattern in those links. Indian. South Asian. Looks like the culture of castes is something Southeast Asia has to figure out, rather than the religions.
t1_dstpstn	0	*	This is just a hilarious oversimplification of the issue. You know you ain't gonna get any kind of solutions when you try pull shit like that right?
t1_dsv3bpw	0	*	I notice you're using past tense. Probably because it's not sustainable. 
t1_dsv1fm1	1	*	Just to give feedback on this, we have the exact same thing happening in New Zealand, locals not wanting to work on farms and often being unreliable.
t1_dufpobg	0	*	No because odds don't work like that. :D

t1_dug4bee	0	*	That's included in the numbers I looked at. So 1/3 of traffic deaths are from drunk driving.

t1_dufwk3w	0	*	> Pilot here.  Shouldn't you be paying attention to the controls or something? 
t1_dufv2f5	1	*	Driving is mostly this way you just don't consciously accept it.  Someone runs a red light?  Boom, you're dead.
t1_dufplnv	0	*	Prepare to hear every minute detail about it for the next 2-5 years!
t1_dufm5zh	0	*	Well, they keep crashing them into mountains...  /s

t1_dufo4hj	1	*	Yeah, thats where I got hung up.  Someone fucked up
t1_dufpppj	0	*	Whoosh. 
t1_dufufmt	1	*	They're the one currently in a position of power, so if they're letting other people step on them, they're an incompetent nincompoop. It's Damn it, Donald! for me.
t1_dugdoei	1	*	At least if your plane flies into a mountain, you'll likely die before your brain can even register anything.
t1_dugu8qt	1	*	I hate flying too but just know that 0 people died from commercial passenger airplane crashes in 2017.
t1_dufms4n	1	*	That's the spirit. Let's do it. More likes more prayers is all I care about.

t1_du5u7l9	1	*	Nice try, Amazon guy.
t1_du5e2zt	1	*	>I HIGHLY doubt this.  Oh no
t1_du5i4nd	1	*	A rather controversal statement 
t1_du5y04i	1	*	A lot less limits than any other country, especially Germany. 
t1_du5mn51	1	*	Exactly the point is to make the penalty so high that companies can't just eat the fines as the cost of doing business

t1_du574t0	1	*	>Apologetically yours
t1_du630g9	0	*	I dont think so actually. Certain things are required for the system to function. Session cookies would be in that category as well.
t1_du5ijx5	1	*	Well how close was it? There really should be a reasonable amount of space but to actually refurbish the whole room sounds pretty crazy.

t1_du5sxsm	1	*	I think that's how its *supposed* to be. Fines aren't supposed to be a little thing. 
t1_du58xb2	0	*	There shouldn't be any upper limit. Corporate fines should be your approximate earnings from your illegal activity. Doubled. Then fucking double it again for every repeat offense. 
t1_du5t68y	1	*	Its 4% or $25 million, *whichever is greater.*   It is costing publishers, here in the US, about $1m just to prepare for GDPR. Lawyers making out like bandits, too. 
t1_du5e9c5	1	*	People are already saying that.
t1_du50oug	1	*	That will be the rule of the law in EU ( and on anyone who handles EU residents data) after May, when GDPR comes in to effect. It demands privacy by design, privacy by default.
t1_du5xmri	1	*	Go around Germany saying/showing off anything Nazi related in public and tell me if you don't get in trouble. 
t1_du5731e	1	*	Well the good news is that at any time, you can get a grip and realize that that isn't happening.
t1_du58e3q	1	*	This is sad.
t1_du5fsrz	1	*	ISPs are monopolies and oligopolies that have destroyed free markets in the US in internet and cable servicing.  Just one of many examples.

t1_du6a9ts	1	*	Same would go for iMessage then, which also checks if the number is using an iCloud account and can receive iMessage.

t1_dt1644z	1	*	west papua
t1_dt1rge7	1	*	Well kind of like Christianity where some claim non-belivers will hate them because they are influenced by the devil and the devil hates god so it's proof that they are righteous  or some such BS.
t1_dt0ia5w	0	*	>most, not all  Oh not all so you are not an islamophobe trying to justify his islamophobia, you dont hate Muslims you just hate the majority of Muslims, thats ok. /s
t1_dt0kebw	0	*	Oh I am sure a muslim would get the same sentence. But my point is that the religion is a factor in what kind of punishment they get.
t1_dt2imhi	0	*	Quran 4:34 a man can beat his wife , sure it gives more rights.   the Bible might say that but how many countries is homosexuality punishable by death? oh yeah the muslim ones

t1_dtblsnn	1	*	Are you still referring to my use of the word 'retard'? Is there a more fitting word to describe Trump? A person so predictably out of his depth it's actually hilarious.

t1_dtbrpry	0	*	They will deny everything  theyve already shown how. 
t1_dtbxwfx	0	*	> Dealing with Russians is only 'bad' because 'muh Russia!'.  Nah, it's more bad because Trump has staunchly denied having any ties to Russia at all.
t1_dtbnk67	0	*	Quote the passage from the book that states that. You are drinking too much Hannity kool aid. 
t1_dtboxrm	1	*	Getting conservative christians (or republicans) all in the same bag is one of the reasons why Trump got elected.  Keep it up. At this rate, you will have to deal with for 8 years.

t1_dt8rvh5	0	*	lets just say it's a sliding scale and religion plays a bigger role than in....Canada, but much less of a role than... Egypt  Good?
t1_dt8y80u	1	*	Fine by me, but there is only one side as long as Israel doesn't recognise a Palestinian state. There is only Israel. Hence we could only conclude Israelis are evil. Which would be a shitstorm.

t1_duw7uvv	1	*	Its almost funny that when someone starts talking about Chinese people, they always starts from the viewpoint of Chinese government, or the ruling class. 
t1_dtqvdfb	1	*	You said: that suggests they talk about a lot of things, you didnt ask about being explained anything.  So pu-lease, dont reframe your bait comment calling me a dick.

t1_dsaotc6	1	*	If you are a refugee fleeing ISIS, and you are fine with Jews living free, safe, and independent in their own country, you won't have a problem in Germany

t1_ds2ytzb	1	*	True, thanks for the correction. The word puzzle isn't very appropriate. It is more bruteforcing a solution by trial and error, where more processing power = more possible solutions per second.

t1_dtmupsm	0	*	You could say the same thing about circumcision yet there seems to be a groundswell of opposition to that religious practice.
t1_dtmvih9	1	*	No. Just ban garments that were invented by misogynists to subjugate women.

t1_dtn5eqo	0	*	Think about it for a sec...Use other cultures in your thought process.

t1_ds3fb77	1	*	The joke is that you are hungry again shortly after eating Chinese food. I think it has something to do with the nature of MSG  
t1_dshwizq	0	*	The current fight in the Middle East is being fought on nebulous fronts over much of the middle east, and on terrorist level, all over the world.  Easier to count which nations are NOT involved in it.

t1_dtik5w6	1	*	It's Australias all the way down.
t1_dtimfdu	1	*	Except for the bit about him being found completely innocent.
t1_dtjohuq	1	*	So if you were kidnapped and put in jail and tortured for the rest of your life you'd be fine with it? 
t1_dtikvut	0	*	This logic applies to Trump too, though. The lack of bipartisan support boxes him into the Republican position.
t1_dtioqld	1	*	realistically? none, would cause too much of a political and diplomatic headache for no real benefit.

t1_dtiiysb	0	*	U mean that same? Obama kept Gitmo open.
t1_dtifpjx	1	*	Sounds like something we should have reminded them of in the 60's
t1_dtin1iv	1	*	They are big boys now doing big boy things. Brings a tear to my eye watching them grow up!
t1_dti5vs0	1	*	Also.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Intelligence_Committee_report_on_CIA_torture
t1_dtik7gs	0	*	Ask yourself how many times you have thought this about some action he took. Hell you probably thought this about his pussy grabbing. 
t1_dtikzym	0	*	The golden rule.
t1_dtit7no	1	*	We need to make bots like Russia does just to tweet this to trump all day every day no problem.   
t1_dtijmky	0	*	Everyone deserves human rights. It's why they're called human rights.
t1_dti527e	0	*	Let's see a source for that
t1_dtioduh	1	*	I seen that one I think, he had people following him around.
t1_dtighol	1	*	https://youtu.be/_1MDrwqjeGo  This is a pretty good movie if you dont mind Kristen Stewart. Its still on Netflix. I really liked the poop scene. 
t1_dtiuj0r	1	*	Thats what muddles the argument tho is that sometimes people dont care. But factually, they torture perfectly innocent people there right along side the actual criminals.
t1_dtijbto	1	*	Thanks for posting that link, the documentary looks interesting.
t1_dtioe8w	0	*	That's like ..your opinion.. man.  (We'll have to agree to disagree.)  (Edit: Fixed quote. Darn autocorrect!)
t1_dtigrlb	0	*	Delete the /s. That's the reason. They won't admit they fucked up, because then they'd owe it to the man and possibly to Canada to make up for it. 
t1_dtiqmjf	1	*	How does the analogy go? America is like a woman; we may not be always right but we're never wrong.
t1_dtinug0	1	*	One very good reason.. also not letting a foreign adversary mix with your own native criminal population is another.
t1_dtiio2j	0	*	RemindMe! 1 day Cut /u/hogstor's nuts off.  You're lucky its your cake day piggy.

t1_dtigpa9	0	*	He stole 10.5 million dollars from the weak Canadian government.
t1_dtinpzm	1	*	Mr. Trump is certainly no saint in this regard.
t1_dtimpu8	1	*	Yeah, I think you're right.   In my defence, there are several other comments in the thread defending torture using similar logic.   I'm also quite hungry. 
t1_dtioxyz	1	*	I mean, we could just cut all their heads off an be done with It. 
t1_dtiq3l8	1	*	I read this as Obama was against single player, I figured maybe he liked to lan or veg out with Biden in his man cave playing halo or battlefront. 
t1_dtj7lia	0	*	Than put them on trial already, prove in a court of law that they committed those acts. This is the real problem I have with gitmo, the detainment of people who have not been convicted of a crime.
t1_dtijcu6	0	*	This is the most appalling analogy, refugees living in Australia would likely have zero affect on your life.  I also agree that I would think you're a bad human for that.
t1_dti8qz0	1	*	Obama had two years with a democratic congress. There were some democrats voting against it the first time in 2009. 
t1_dtiuttk	0	*	It's the first one. And even if it was the 2nd one, that's a just as big of a reason we shouldn't let then loose they already turned like a werewolf during a full moon. 
t1_dtim5q8	1	*	Who is y'all? I am a generally left leaning Australian.
t1_dtiinmm	1	*	Im sure Reddit will downvote me but are you really defending the fucking Taliban? Jesus! Go read about the human rights abuses the Taliban inflicted on their own people!   
t1_dtispor	1	*	> Republicans pushed hard against it with scary statements like Meet your new neighbor, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad?. Ultimately Dem leadership shut it down.  This is the two parties in a nutshell.
t1_dtihlmb	1	*	Tell that to Native Americans.
t1_dtik4rz	1	*	Yeah seriously.. Seems like a really shit gift for graduating bomb making class. I can pick one up for xa36 from Argos.
t1_dtihkaj	0	*	Yes.
t1_dtijyfr	1	*	And the US gets shit just for wanting the immigrants to go back to their country.  Hell... we even pay to bus them back and we still get shit.

t1_dtdkgmz	1	*	>and is vendored by pharmacists.  Where exactly does this happen?  
t1_dt85zgc	0	*	No, China would stop selling the drugs immediately, end of the problem.
t1_dt7pmrv	1	*	So, show us what you've read. 
t1_dt7cx57	0	*	I'm not saying he's not, I'm saying that's a weak argument

t1_dtiayr1	0	*	We don't have crime gangs running around and killing people willy-nilly anymore though.
t1_dth83os	1	*	Fair enough, but you clearly cannot argue properly. You just make a fool of yourself on the internet. :D
t1_dth9moz	1	*	Doping is small potatoes compared to actual issues. 
t1_dslc9rl	0	*	Well I was on Mobile at the time. Not everybody need citations on a guess. Especially when I am not asserting something.  Otherwise, 2/3 of reddit posts would be deleted on lack of sources. 
t1_dsl2rwh	0	*	You've never been to Tibet, just shut up. Even taiwanese consider tibet a part of china, the taiwanese even claim mongolia is part of china.
t1_ds2czaj	0	*	Mr no-solutions acting like he knows better. 
t1_dst07um	0	*	Having the facility the way it is is a necessary evil, torturing those within it is not.  If you don't see the difference maybe you should spend a couple of years there.
t1_dstl9ma	1	*	I didn't misread it - it says he stopped working for the CIA in 2007. That's why I'm wondering why he had the documents on him 5 years later.
t1_dst1hb1	1	*	Since when is China an ally of the US, or even an ally.
t1_dsszuk5	1	*	no it's not.
t1_dssza64	1	*	While the story might be made up the tactics definitely aren't.
t1_dssxk22	1	*	Agreed it's not a paved way and it varies from country to county but its not shocking to hear that China could have killed both the local and the international asset at all.
t1_dv3jkqt	0	*	That does not support your statement at all.  What you said was:  > A life sentence is ... typically about 25 years.   A source would show that most life sentenced are about 25 years. 
t1_dv4wxj3	1	*	It's extremely hard to de-radicalize anyone
t1_dv4ro8k	1	*	Im not actually sure how many people are reading the article. This is in the UK. Police are not routinely armed with firearms. A 17-year old being able to drive a manual transmission car is normal.
t1_dv3c8gb	1	*	brazil?
t1_dv34nvc	1	*	The kids needs therapy. That is about it.
t1_dv3r4oh	1	*	Sorry not an actual diagnosis, I meant people seeking a medical certification to help mitigate a criminal sentence.  Someone close to me just did similar 
t1_dv4bw75	1	*	Honestly, if they released him I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up dead within a month.
t1_dv46n2s	0	*	Could you link it or PM me?    I've tried to find it for a while, just out of curiocity of course I have no sympathy for their views, but I haven't had any luck so far.  
t1_dtf5n8h	0	*	LOL NO
t1_ds25wnz	1	*	NPR and PBS are publicly funded as well. If nobody paid, we wouldn't have it anymore. 
t1_ds29fsk	1	*	Yes.
t1_ds2mure	1	*	I'm doing that tomorrow, as soon as I'm able. This has me quite concerned, thanks for replying! 
t1_ds30gow	1	*	Sounds awful. Try an edible made with distillate.

t1_ds2aiah	0	*	And you get what you pay for.
t1_ds2fjyv	1	*	Really? All I see is pro-liberal news on Facebook, and anti-Trump/anti-Rep.   I guarantee you twitter, Reddit, and facebook push a liberal agenda.
t1_ds2b10q	0	*	Did you read the article?
t1_ds2rkx7	0	*	Interesting, what makes you say its mandatory? Like the fed will bust you easier for outdoor growing or state actually has a provision for it?

t1_ds4ajj8	1	*	Hint. Buy bitcoin. Now!

t1_ds30okw	0	*	We're not a lab. 
t1_ds2i6gf	1	*	Yup.   I only use organic crap on my grow, but I still flush with water and molasses the last month because I can't imagine fertilizer doesn't change the taste...
t1_ds2evwv	1	*	That's why I let them feed me ads while I enjoy their content
t1_ds270pb	0	*	I'm curious, how can they straight up forbid a certain type of legal action against them? Is it like a ToS sort of thing?
t1_ds259ua	1	*	not necessarily true

t1_ds24ehs	0	*	So how do you rinse the buds without washing off the trichs?

t1_dtxd21m	0	*	It's the same kind of thing as the inheritance. You can make choices that will probably be followed once you're dead, but you don't have rights yourself once you're dead.
t1_dtxvlwr	1	*	Maybe someone in your life would care, though.
t1_dtxdrbb	0	*	I've never known someone who has wanted so desperately to bury his head in the sand. Are you saying it's ok for someone to rape your dead daughter... as long as you don't have to hear about it?
t1_dtxqs6e	1	*	It's a rough and thankless job that comes with shitty hours, heavy lifting, nasty chemicals and social stigma. Is it any surprise that people who chose to do it, are say, uh attracted to the job? 
t1_dtxfb8p	0	*	Despicable? That's an understatement if ever I heard one. Despicable is more like it.
t1_dtxhksx	1	*	I mean... they listen to your problems for hours and never interrupt. 
t1_dtxbpp8	0	*	And a word to the wise when the fire dies
t1_dtxkzyi	0	*	They banned it   er, I mean, *pretty sure* its been banned 
t1_dsy0fb7	0	*	What's your point, in providing that map?  Most of those rivers don't have over 1 million people living just downstream.
t1_dse21d2	0	*	Also give zero fucks just like triggering right wing tards like yourself

t1_dsg7k4g	0	*	Why do you care? Have the Syrians shown they even care about development?
t1_du6jux5	1	*	Or simply Eurasia, though the actual part being on the Asian continent is fairly small. Not that I care too much about artificial borders drawn across landmasses anyway.
t1_du6bpfw	1	*	I remember reading an article that basically said that's where we fucked up(by letting private companies dominate net)
t1_du7rsr8	1	*	Then they should lose their common carrier protections. 
t1_du7bf1j	1	*	I think I just read the plot for Lethal Weapon 5. Now I just need to hear Murtaugh tell me hows he's too old for this shit.
t1_du60lh7	1	*	bots probably?
t1_du73fvm	0	*	Do you know who I am or what I do with my money ?   Guess it's a prerequisite to release my expenditures before commenting on reddit ? Are you serious ? 
t1_dsj30x4	1	*	You are wrong there but since it means also 'the underlying intentions or motives of a particular person or group.' it cannot be totally misconstrued as altruistic.
t1_dus5jjt	1	*	My sympathy for humanitarian intervention in any form ended in Somalia. 
t1_dupbvmn	1	*	And trying to screw workers with Work Choices. 
t1_dsb7esh	0	*	Yes, but all dogs can get the potential health issues that are common in the breed. 
t1_ds8jkmg	1	*	that looks indeed like what I described. Still a bulldog but better 
t1_ds8f3dz	0	*	Do you have any sources for that? C-section births are fairly new so I'd be really surprised to see them have an appreciable effect on human genetics.
t1_ds8g6zf	0	*	Same with me. His only problem is farting, snoring, and loving the fireplace. Besides getting a tapeworm once he has been great the first year of his life.
t1_ds9c81b	1	*	Seconding Trupanion!
t1_ds9caiu	1	*	Might as well bring a hyena. 
t1_ds8gsbd	0	*	Bad but idk about worse humans>dogs imo
t1_ds8jftx	1	*	can confirm ,my grandmom owns 3 of them and they are great sweet dogs ! Although its sad that she lost her Labrador that (such a sweet thing  ) at 13 years ,very recently :( .
t1_ds8mvtu	0	*	There isn't any proof that it isn't, just they looks like dachshund cats so they must have bad backs.
t1_ds9ldd7	1	*	Breeding dogs made sense when certain traits complimented the lifestyle you had to survive.   Now those traits are, mostly, not necessary.   
t1_ds8v3jo	1	*	One would hope. 
t1_ds8m140	0	*	Guinea pigs?
t1_ds8qnnt	1	*	I bet Lily is a good girl. I love mutts. Rescued mine too and he's so sweet. Just wants to be loved. 
t1_ds8jzhc	0	*	But did you report the breeder?
t1_ds96zlg	0	*	It shocked me when during professional school we had to take a course with other health sciences and I found out how little vets make. It is truly a calling :)
t1_ds9n7wy	0	*	I know two. My step brother's mother and another that runs a kennel. 
t1_ds8kgs7	0	*	Is that common for dog show contestants? Honest question... I'm not familiar with the industry.
t1_ds8e5hb	0	*	No, counterexample. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterexample  He essentially said do not get ANY purebreds, they ALL suffer, you WILL suffer. Any counterexample will disprove his statement.
t1_ds8pbie	1	*	I love cavs but they are pretty well doomed. It's depressing.
t1_ds8yb18	1	*	Even responsible people lose track of their dogs sometimes. 
t1_ds9ndif	0	*	Nope, just wanted to make sure that you were an asshole all around the board. 
t1_ds906mj	1	*	They sure are dog shaped, and probably very good dogs!
t1_ds8fhw5	1	*	Why do you have to be so rude about it? Not defending the guy but jeez calm down
t1_ds8hwh3	0	*	Rare breeds aren't actually a bad thing, as long as the breed club can keep a decent number of breeding stock active. Being rare wards off the bybs.
t1_ds99d9h	1	*	Ours has a monthly premium option. We just pay it all in one big chunk though. We love it, and it's been so useful.

t1_ds8jw6g	1	*	Little did you know that I purposely commented with the intent of receiving dog pics...
t1_ds8qc6g	1	*	All of my cats were found on streets or in foresty neighborhoods and adopted. Theyre all fucking adorable, too.

t1_ds93axn	1	*	> I'm not sure what shops do if nobody buys the pets (probably kill them)  That hurts my lil heart.

t1_ds8n5ii	1	*	You have a few distinct breeds. Maine Coons, Siamese, Hairless
t1_ds8qh28	1	*	Sure but if youre at a shelter you usually dont know which kind of mutt it is. 
t1_ds99tlr	1	*	Well they do now with hormone therapy...

t1_ds8gyyr	1	*	But I thought they were bred to accompany the Queen!  Love corgis. So friendly and energetic. 
t1_ds8ojqu	0	*	In one of my comments I do mention them. But most people who own dogs have them for companionship, not as guide dogs, sled dogs, hunting dogs, sheep dogs etc. Of course those are still used plenty. 
t1_ds8qafw	1	*	Up to and including 'maintaining the purity of the royal bloodline'.
t1_ds8ho6k	0	*	Its not the truth though. There are tons of purebred breeds without health issues.   True, some purebred breeds have the worst health issues, but others have none.

t1_ds8dzox	1	*	Yes.
t1_ds8kcg3	1	*	They look a lot like mine!  Mutts are the best. I hate how there is a corgi meme on reddit.
t1_ds8u79m	0	*	Even puppy mill dogs aren't always going to be cheap. Lots of people are willing to pay a lot for a purebred (or even a designer breed) and they take advantage of that.
t1_dsablb4	0	*	Eh. Pits are fine. The difference between pugs and pits is that there are more pits that need love and adoption than any other dog. We need more pits owners tbh.

t1_dtizwi3	1	*	They don't just outright deny them, they take them to the police and make it their problems. They are homeless because they don't want to live behind bars.

t1_dtkb26a	1	*	> Is the local Council suppose to solve the homeless issue?  I think they should give it a high priority, above vanity projects.

t1_dtj0uii	1	*	Not to be mean but a bad 10% could make a shelter unlivible for the rest. It is easy to say, but can you imagine living in a shelter if the fucking thing were like Mad Max with a side of prison rape? 
t1_dtj3xra	1	*	I lived next door to a shelter and it always had empty beds. Meanwhile, a little shanty town popped up under the bridge right behind us, with a bunch of drunk and drugged out homeless people.

t1_ds23ljy	1	*	Wait what? The leverage isn't gone lol. It's not like it couldn't be renegotiated 
t1_ds1j34b	1	*	Except pulling aid is a stick and you always have the carrot of restoring aid. Its not like cutting off diplomatic ties altogether. You always have leverage. 
t1_ds1jpel	0	*	I never said I trusted him. Just that hes more likely to do something to piss others off than the previous president. Dont put words in my mouth please.
t1_ds1eo4s	1	*	So that we can conduct drone strikes without certain people getting pissed off.  Pakistan is an incredibly unstable country with nukes.

t1_ds30mc8	1	*	Ok mate. 
t1_ds1vrq3	0	*	Not ww3 and Pakistan got nukes, right? But more war to distract from something domestic and to enrich some of his buddies is something I would give him any day
t1_ds1llti	1	*	Pakistan's romance with China intensified.  Pakistan purchased hundreds of modified Chinese Mig-21s to keep pace with India's air power.
t1_ds1gzma	0	*	That dude is clueless.   Pakistan is not an Islamic Republic   GTFOH
t1_ds1tnxj	1	*	The us doesn't deal with massive foreign conspiracies against our homeland. Unless Pakistan wants more suicide bombings in its prosperous cities, I don't see how they don't need us more...

t1_ds1f3yy	1	*	Great. So North Korea part 2? With a country with ten times the population and seething with jihadis? I mean, what could *possibly* go wrong?
t1_ds1g6jb	1	*	except this *is* more of the same. He's just done the same as Obama by calling them out on it but not actually doing anything. You got fooled if you think he's going to shake anything up
t1_ds1fchm	1	*	You're the one that brought up their hypocrisy, just pointing out that there's enough to go around
t1_ds1ds6c	1	*	>terror activity   Imagine saying this unironicaly.    Terror is a made up boogy man the US uses to keep people worried and supporting the US military spending. Why puppet? 
t1_ds1gqnf	1	*	It goes both ways, The US extorts the world and make the world keep using the dollar as the defacto currency. Its a cruel world and somebpdy is playing it.

t1_ds1ifs7	1	*	If you have leverage that never gets the other country to do anything you want, you shouldn't be afraid to use it
t1_ds1l44c	1	*	That's why he said equivalent 
t1_ds1neca	1	*	Everybody looks past the good shit hes done. Hes had his fair share of fuck ups, but Im still trying to be optimistic.
t1_ds1jen6	1	*	I mean he actually enforced the red line when Assad did a sarin gas salsa dance over it. That alone separates him from his predecessor and thus far the chemical weapon usage has stopped.
t1_ds1efrs	1	*	Nah he's a total fool, cutting the crap or not.  edit: lol that it is controversial that Trump is a goddamned idiot
t1_ds1v5wn	0	*	His comment seemed more intended as a quick rebuttal to clarify why The Independent is disliked more than an argumentative essay.
t1_ds1hgw3	1	*	No one. Just stay out of the region. Please
t1_ds39po9	1	*	Well. I can't sway your opinion.  Our military is the least to blame out of every party involved. 
t1_ds2bt8u	0	*	That doesn't even make sense. The post revolution government being shit doesn't change that the Islamic revolution occurred without a single major battle needing to be fought.
t1_ds1in2m	1	*	And all the other countries are noticing that, as well. 
t1_ds2duir	1	*	No, its a current reason. A side effect would imply there is a way we could do something about it by removing a variable today. 
t1_ds1lw41	1	*	Pak military and pak intelligence (ISI) are also different....
t1_duw81qt	0	*	Are you talking Farenheit or Celcius?  Because -10 celcius is COLD and below the freezing point.

t1_dtqaruh	1	*	There's good reason to dislike this policy, especially if you have any issues with Trump's rhetoric about immigration. 
t1_dtqg9tm	1	*	I think it is weird, they need to open their borders and stop being backward.
t1_dtq8heg	1	*	I get that, but only including people based on their skin tone is complete racism. It's not Black people who wanted to exterminate Jews in 1948, but Pan-Arab nationalist Islamists.

t1_du2e7ps	0	*	Having nuclear weapons, but not claiming you have them is probably the pinnacle of that phrase. You have the most powerful weapon used in human history, but don't publicly claim you have it.

t1_dsqfkw4	1	*	So is the perpetrator innocent until proven guilty or guilty until proven innocent? Because believing the victim before proving proof and therefore accusing the perpetrator is the latter.

t1_ds4sc25	0	*	> The reason companies want H1B's is because ~~there's not enough Americans to take the jobs. We have to import people.~~ they refuse to pay a competitive wage.

t1_ds4lnpr	0	*	No you seem to think its the 1930s lol 
t1_ds4rvm4	1	*	What is the underemployment rate in the tech sector?
t1_ds4vihh	1	*	This is true. Unfortunately this is just one of the measures that are going to be implemented. One is to raise the minimum salary to 90,000. Which would disqualify a lot of potential H1B recipients. 
t1_ds4v56b	1	*	My company's H1B workers are on the same exact schedule as anyone else at their level. 
t1_ds56o5i	1	*	There's a shortage of *qualified* tech workers, all over the world. And it's not a matter of money; those people just *don't exist*.
t1_ds4k5di	1	*	They wouldn't have Ozil though  :(
t1_ds4rxlp	1	*	Argentina is a big one!! I personally think the Philippines should be pressing their cultural and linguistic advantages more.

t1_dsdwzb2	0	*	Who are paid by ??
t1_dt6l22x	1	*	ok...my point was that Rex Tillerson didn't actually accuse Russia of chemical weapons attacks, like the article title suggests. 
t1_dus39fm	1	*	Lmao, parts of the dossier being unverified are not the same thing as it being fraudulent. Can you name for me a single allegation made in the dossier that has actually been disproved?
t1_dts73w3	0	*	We call Spiegel Bildzeitung der Studenten - BILD of undergraduates
t1_dtrp6hf	0	*	I use it medicinally, it's not really feasible to take an international train once a day ;)
t1_dtrtw7w	1	*	A single shop isn't allowed to sell you as much  The seven shops all belonging together in the same street right next to each other?  Each one of them will sell you 5g no problem

t1_dtu6ckr	0	*	yes you take the crime element out of it and manage it  ridiculous I know  crazy 
t1_dts6iyd	1	*	I would say this is probably the same graph as you'd find from any other newspaper in the world.
t1_dsipzsh	1	*	And the US generates 50% more emissions (5.2tt US vs 3.5tt EU) than EU while having 40% less population (325M US vs 511M EU).  
t1_dt6i3dw	1	*	Yeah, pretty dumb. Weve had aircraft carriers stationed in Japan for decades now. 
t1_dsr7elg	0	*	And it's even more imporant to recognize the given factors for the data we do have. Especially when it comes to plague, as it was usually hidden in official documents, seeing as it was bad for trade.
t1_dsaduft	0	*	No there isn't, bush did way worse things. 
t1_ds9wpye	1	*	 Chaotic evil vs. Lawful evil. 
t1_dsan4na	1	*	I made the same mistake myself.
t1_dsaalye	1	*	I guess so? 
t1_ds1gchm	1	*	The best part is, you dont even have to be the first to have lived there, just say God told you it was yours. 
t1_dtnh6d6	0	*	Oh, I thought it was the daughter of Mr. Spelling.
t1_dukwndb	1	*	forget that...remember that passenger airline that was shot down and shit all happened.
t1_duleo59	0	*	I'm pretty sure a lot of people do. Trolls like you are just a very vocal minority with help from the state and a few gullible people.
t1_duljvqk	0	*	Stopping a one man anti-putin crusade hurts putin more than it helps him? This is the kind of silly logic I am talking about. 
t1_dukzx20	1	*	The first rule of Troll Club, is don't talk about Troll Club.
t1_dukj5mx	1	*	Common sense.... doesn't need backing besides if you weren't foaming at the mouth you'd see I actually agreed with the guy I replied to. We definitely wouldn't be hearing from him again
t1_dul3g7t	0	*	Im just gonna presume thats fuck your mother neutrality 
t1_dukatmz	0	*	So close, yet so Russian. Sanctions and Russian economic collapse incoming. When you trade your cellphone for a loaf of bread, I hope you think of me.
t1_dukyqni	1	*	I agree with you. You offer enough money and people will gladly work for them. There are definitely trolls who probably believe the guy got what he deserved too. 
t1_dsp2ele	0	*	I think you confuse decentralize ledger with decentralize currency.  At the moment, the only decentralize currency is goods, i.e. I will trade you 1 chicken for 10 packs of gum.
t1_dsre0vu	0	*	There were about two dozen rocket attacks on Israel in 2017. I wouldn't call that close to zero.  > everyone who has fired a rocket has been detained  How could you possibly know that?
t1_dtgt3pn	0	*	You're not allowed to invade your neighbours in violation of signed treaties just to secure your borders. It's considered a *dick move* (also  an act of war). 
t1_dtgbgns	1	*	Google Hum Scare and Sick Building Syndrome, that is what this is. Dressed up and politicized.
t1_dso9qyp	0	*	Who the fuck uses birdshot to shoot people? Slugs or 00 is where it's at!

t1_dsmmzw5	1	*	And hatred.
t1_dtnuynl	0	*	How do you know he wasn't a terrorist settler? Probable was. They are best at burning civilian property, stealing land and committing crimes.

t1_dta2yl2	1	*	Implying they have brains
t1_dta0bw8	0	*	Either he's wrong or Google does a horrible job at translating Vrijheid van meningsuiting, article 7 of my constitution. 
t1_dta1tbg	1	*	Actually that makes more sense.  I'd expect cultural/social ignorance out of a STEM grad before a social science grad.
t1_dtakl73	1	*	There are times where you have to stand up for yourself against the deodorant Nazis ! 
t1_dtaaih8	0	*	That's like saying you can murder freely, you'll just face repercussions from the justice system for doing it. The repercussions are what make the thing not free to do.
t1_dt9zhj9	0	*	I'm giving it a 99% chance that the guy had [this](http://modern-hairstyles.net/men-celebrities-undercut-haircuts/) haircut, which like 50% of men under 30 are sporting right now. Pretty silly of her.
t1_dtblxhy	1	*	Actually, she was dealing with small-minded petty tyrants and used a common eiphthet for small-minded petty tyrants.  If this were about the TSA, everyone would be on her side, lol 
t1_dtaf5ni	1	*	Maybe which flavor of arts and sciences you study really doesn't say much about how real your education is?
t1_dtaifk0	1	*	Or a football player.
t1_dt9y01l	0	*	Austrias greatest achievements were to convince the world that Hitler is German and Beethoven is Austrian.
t1_dtbdj2k	0	*	You dont know what free speach is. 
t1_dtacaar	1	*	> The way she portrays herself as a holy individual that behaved perfectly and was being treated with utter contempt for no reason   Welcome to the far left.
t1_dta11u3	1	*	Ridiculed by everyone but the president. 
t1_dtab99u	0	*	Says the person taught history by a government that severely limits speech regarding Nazi Germany.

t1_dt9wjjt	1	*	Ha! Nice!
t1_dta4xc7	1	*	Did I miss the Nazi apologists?
t1_dt9vp3x	0	*	My great grandmother died in the holocaust. They came to the hospital that she was in and took her straight to an internment center. There was no trial, not even a sham of one
t1_dtao786	1	*	Those are not fixed fines though. The fines by German courts are always based on your monthly salary. Those are just average fines handed out by German courts. 
t1_dt9zmy2	0	*	As long as police in Germany are busting people for drugs and other victimless crimes, they are like many Nazis long ago. 
t1_dta4ghp	1	*	How is pointing out asinine, rude, or dishonest behaviour that is public information propaganda?
t1_dtaozfh	0	*	Freedom. Free speech. Lmao did u not hear him?
t1_dta5ui2	1	*	Id say shes more clearly describing the classic lumberjack hipster look
t1_dtaj43b	1	*	I didnt say nobody tried. I said nobody died.

t1_dt9wlq0	1	*	> much larger  hahahahaha  I mean, in the sense that a fly is much larger than a microbe, I suppose you're right. But neither are a serious concern.
t1_dtac3ne	0	*	> The liberal left in America calls anyone who isn't a full blown communist a Nazi.   Do you not see the contradiction here?
t1_dtapk9v	1	*	TIL I'm a Nazi. 
t1_dt9zao7	1	*	Dude you can say Nazis
t1_dt9x0a1	1	*	>real education  Wat?
t1_dta49eh	0	*	Whatever is popular on the wharf in San Francisco.  She clearly was a tourist who probably flew in, I don't know why she was acting so blown away by security rules on the way out. 
t1_dta1n5l	0	*	Followed by I want to speak to your manager.
t1_dtawbdy	1	*	> and even then most cases will be thrown out for being trivial.  So if its cops and the word is *nazi*, its not trivial. Got it.
t1_dta63za	0	*	Can confirm, there are some extremely German communities in the Midwest 
t1_dt9qzbb	0	*	That is for the court to decide, isn't it? 
t1_dta8zhq	1	*	Yeah my bad shoulda said punishing someone for insulting you is something a Nazi would do.
t1_dta1p5i	1	*	Yes, a snow kangaroo
t1_dta6z6j	0	*	They are a very powerful group that works behind the scenes to ensure that America supports, politically and militarily, the spread of multinational corporations.
t1_dt9yojn	0	*	Yeah it's a pretty common haircut. Slicked back at an angle. For guys with short hair this is just an easy way to do your hair and it looks nice.
t1_dt9zrz2	0	*	Fascism is exclusively right-wing, buddy.
t1_dta0cus	1	*	isnt she one of those shitholes eh?
t1_dt9vfs0	0	*	They were just FC Kxf6ln or Kaiserslautern fans...
t1_dta7ifi	1	*	Well I don't like Putin's cock - you voted for him.
t1_dt9yox9	0	*	> facts  Speaking of, are you _actually_ called those names often, or are you just worrying about hypotheticals?
t1_dtaa01k	0	*	Or perhaps they revere those flags, and carefully wash and iron them after every march?  Regardless, that is a very weak defence of nazis, fella. You're not really helping your cause.
t1_dtaq2my	0	*	There's free speech in Germany. Insults aren't necessary to get your point across, are they ?
t1_dtap1qz	0	*	>  As in she might be pro-israel/anti-muslim and therefore support drone strikes? Not sure what the connection here is  Yes, that's exactly it. 
t1_dt9vspb	1	*	Yes those people are but the word is getting thrown around too easily now a days. Its really disrespectful. 
t1_dt9x7rp	1	*	Just her adjectives for him pissed me off. Maybe you dont need to reiterate how above this guy you feel? If hes so horrible, you can just show me and let me use my judgment.
t1_dta3201	0	*	That's not a trait of professors-- that's a trait of pricks, which you find in every profession.
t1_dtajupg	0	*	So everything is literal?
t1_dtbmxru	1	*	She writes like the female equivalent of a neckbeard. That was painful. 
t1_dt9vicy	0	*	Anyone who dismisses a logical and informed conclusion because they don't like a particular term is almost certainly a bigot.
t1_dt9zeaw	0	*	Sorry to break it to you, but USA prohibits slander. So even in your country, it's illegal.
t1_dtaoqbu	1	*	The reason is propaganda and unfathomable ignorance on the issues police face every day.
t1_dt9x1pw	0	*	Reading her article on it left me feeling abused, it's an awful stream of consciousness diatribe, the more I read the more I hated her
t1_dt9vtp1	1	*	It doesn't. 
t1_dtanryd	1	*	In the US you would get a beat down for mouthing off, a drunk driving charge for riding a bicycle after drinking, and felony destruction of government property for the sign.
t1_dt9y8fy	0	*	>Leftists are why you HAVE free speech in America.      And they have abandoned it in favor of other things now.     Also. The Constitution.
t1_dta4a4q	1	*	I get it ... body functions and what not but .... we don't need to read about it, the story could have been just as interesting of a read without the need to tell the world about her heavy flows
t1_dta50l3	1	*	I get the feeling that not only is she entitled, she has a vagina and it empowers her even more.
t1_dta56s3	0	*	> How she thought she knew their disposition, thought process, and motivations.  This is how a lot of people who use words like privilege and gendered in this way seem to think.
t1_dtbv9aw	0	*	http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-insult-law-snap-story.html  It's actually much more than slander to them. 
t1_dta98l7	1	*	I recall it being used as a catch-all at least back into the mid-2000's, probably earlier too.
t1_dt9wtfo	0	*	And the German people agreed (and the overwhelming majority still agrees) that we don't care what you care about. <3
t1_dta8std	0	*	It's a paste. So same rules that apply to liquids. Also, same rules that apply in the US, so I don't understand why is this news to anyone.   https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule
t1_dtaf95i	1	*	> like calling someone a rapist or pedophile  Except calling someone either of those things is not a crime pretty much anywhere unless you can prove slander.
t1_dta8bg6	0	*	The huns shouldn't try to deny their past. Especially when many Nazis who committed atrocities are still alive. 
t1_dt9yv66	0	*	Thats the power of the internet. Vocal minorities have always existed, but now they have control over most of our media.
t1_dta0wco	0	*	Nice try, but no. 
t1_dta9eax	1	*	Yes, I too can use Google Translate.
t1_dta2suv	1	*	[Yeah... this is the article she wrote about the incident. Turns out that's exactly what she did.](https://i.imgur.com/7kz3O2P.png)
t1_dtamzzm	1	*	Personal and friend's anecdotes, along with the hundred of other anecdotes ive heard and nearly daily evidence of how corrupt or law enforcement agency is.
t1_dta5sag	1	*	Decades of anti-communist propaganda will do wonders to a population. 
t1_dt9yeo1	1	*	*stubs my toe*  augh fuck this SJW bullshit
t1_dtabz3l	1	*	I can write fake letters too. Not hard.
t1_dt9wbf5	1	*	Probably not a real education
t1_dtbjw5i	1	*	Well, a little spellcheck here, a little format there. Done. contents fine, yo, no need to check!
t1_dt9tacv	0	*	Not the war against the actual Nazis.
t1_dtar8ag	1	*	The undercut that looks like a hitler jugend haircut is really popular, are the police just supposed to arrest everybody with that haircut? 
t1_dt9zp4h	0	*	American diplomats don't exactly have a great reputation. Especially these days.
t1_dt9ve4d	1	*	Good thing that 90% of those people probably wouldn't know that, and 95% still wouldn't associate Austrians with Nazis.
t1_dtaqk3p	1	*	Then you eradicate them too.
t1_dta24ha	1	*	Georgetown
t1_dtak0dw	1	*	Do you have many leather bound books?
t1_dtajxt3	0	*	On the other hand, she'll maybe want to stay out of the EU for a few decades. 
t1_dta3yjv	1	*	I can't even fathom the amounts of asshole shown in the little snippets quoted above from her tirade in the Huffington Post.
t1_dta1hee	0	*	Different worldviews. Hasn't done the US anything good though.
t1_dtaas79	0	*	Why does it matter to you that the laws in Germany are what they are? Why is that in any way a problem for you? 
t1_dtaoxcg	1	*	I have that haircut. How do I stop being Nazi?
t1_dtagc18	1	*	Those videos are so hard to watch and terrifying too. I agree that's awful. It's still a vast minority of cases where this happens though.
t1_dtausqs	0	*	Actually, I should rephrase that:  Don't make fun of us, we won't make fun of you. Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec are fair game.
t1_dta3zw3	0	*	I was looking for this comment
t1_dtakjeb	1	*	Were they bound in leather? Did you perchance peruse them in your study which smells of rich mahogany?
t1_dtansl6	1	*	It was! I almost took him seriously.
t1_dtawmrl	1	*	Lol this woman probably doesnt know that the Nazi haircut aka Fade, is the regulation haircut of most militaries in the world...
t1_dt9vk70	0	*	Yes, but you can still do it
t1_dta0hvz	0	*	Bespoke: /r/me_ira
t1_dtbllva	1	*	=/= != not equal 
t1_dtbltob	1	*	I can't find Austav anywhere as a name. Probably was Gustav. Especially given she misspelled Mehring as Mehrinj.  Kapoor is an Indian as fuck name. 
t1_dtameic	0	*	The older the berry the sweeter the juice U0001f602
t1_dta0an9	1	*	Maybe maybe not. But to sue someone for that, youd have to go through enough hoops to not gavxe9 it thrown out. 
t1_dta5fix	1	*	This is why /r/sjwhate exists
t1_dta23gl	1	*	They will -full of anger- jaywalk.
t1_dtasnob	0	*	Racial slurs and freedom to express an opinion are a bit different.
t1_dt9wzz3	0	*	well they post lots of shit in cringe anarchy
t1_dt9wz1n	0	*	Yeah, i was trying to point out that you are free to insult a group of people but not one specific person. Replace might get sued with are technically acting against the law
t1_dtan2x4	0	*	A German officer would be legally punished for punching you if you called them a Nazi.  They would however be 100% correct to arrest you for it.
t1_dtakuqm	1	*	Dang, how do I become a HuffPo editor? I'd like to do nothing for money and have time for hobbies. 
t1_dta2siw	0	*	Someone's honor is legally protected in the German constitution?  That's pretty cool, are you German? How does that work?
t1_dt9z7hr	0	*	well maybe but in an one on one situation this will not end well
t1_dtac5db	0	*	Those are rookie numbers, son
t1_dt9x3l8	0	*	You'd have to prove that you were significantly affected  by the insult etc etc. 
t1_dta2spm	0	*	I am concerned by that your implication that that doesn't count as a disaster.
t1_dta1nqc	1	*	You live in a very strange personal world.
t1_dt9w81q	1	*	I like to imagine that when you were asked where you were from, you just replied German... uh... town... and the person you were talking to was just like oh, Wisconsin! and you just went with it.
t1_dta0sr4	1	*	So a STEM idiot doing a humanities job she is utterly unqualified for.   Because STEM is ~~magic~~ real, while the actual knowledge of how people work and live and culture is fluff.   Got it. 
t1_dt9t50m	0	*	I would call it verbal assault or provocation personally  
t1_dtam8u5	1	*	True, but historically it has been what I wrote.
t1_dtah44w	1	*	Yeah I couldn't help but giggle at that part. Because shes implying that she not rude just assertive, when earlier she said a guy was supporting the Hitter youth because he looks like a hipster.
t1_dt9rdf5	1	*	But we do. We're just buying a copy from Austria or install an uncut mod.  You can't remove a precedent without challenging it, and no publisher is for stated reasons.
t1_dta0mj5	1	*	Actually depending on where live, typically in suburban and rural areas and small towns, people are very kind and generous to each other.
t1_dta0nfb	1	*	You find the comments at the top interesting...? I rarely do. Theyre all the same. 
t1_dtac4mp	1	*	I don't know if you're trolling or not with the PC/console remark, but it's glorious either way. I love it
t1_dt9vrg5	1	*	Incorrect
t1_dta7g09	0	*	Like not being allowed to drink in public. Like wtf, why not. Land of the free, yeah right.
t1_dt9tn7z	1	*	There's a difference between calling the descendant of a Nazi a descendant of a Nazi, and calling random German people Nazi.
t1_dtab4lu	1	*	Given that its HuffPo, probably framed in a full size bay window. 
t1_dta7tfh	1	*	And making jokes here can cost you tens of thousands of dollars.   https://news.vice.com/article/a-canadian-comedian-was-ordered-to-pay-42000-because-he-insulted-a-child-with-a-disability
t1_dt9wh9e	1	*	alright, perhaps I will take a gander.
t1_dt9yzzq	1	*	That is a poor stereotype not based in any reality outside of maybe some movies or tv shows. 
t1_dtac22t	0	*	It's called an undercut. It was popular in the early 1900s and it's popular again in the 2010s. Get over it.
t1_dtadl1t	1	*	I kinda want to mail her a stick of deodorant with a return address, just to see the   response she sends back.
t1_dta5pcj	1	*	Well there is a difference between someone who knows their subject and someone who is able to properly teach it. A lot of college professors I have had fall into the former.
t1_dtc3ze3	1	*	In this context, freedom obviously means not facing penalties from the government. 
t1_dtacz6v	0	*	She could have written bhosdike gaand maraa like a sane person, but nooo, madam has to use Google translate and find and copy/paste the fourth item on the first result of common punjabi insults.
t1_dt9z625	1	*	I mean, that's great and all, but I've not seen any evidence that biochem majors can't be culturally ignorant assholes.
t1_dtajqnu	1	*	Maybe you're just a misogynist member of the patriarchy?
t1_dtaws7y	0	*	I wonder which came first cops with no respect for people or people with no respect for cops?
t1_dtad3eb	0	*	Bad joke? Check. Assumption of moral high ground? Check. Rage quitting when called out for shitty opinion? Check.  You must be a liberal.
t1_dtblk8w	1	*	Thanks I try my best haha. I'm a french horn player so Germany is really important to me :)
t1_dt9t4sa	0	*	You also do not know anything about these policemen.
t1_dtad9ps	1	*	Eh- idk if things are all that bad. Youre seeing and hearing a very vocal minority, which while worrying, isnt indicative of the whole generation.   
t1_dtbfrl1	0	*	Perhaps.   But we all know that finding some people with colourful opinions is not a sound basis for assessment foreign policy thesis.  
t1_dt9xuov	0	*	They openly share that ideology to the point permitted by German law, so yes
t1_dt9x5zo	1	*	Ahh yes. The STEM circlejerk. 
t1_dta1mgz	1	*	[how could i possibly introduce *you* to the manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQrdm-UEBY#t=2m6s)
t1_dtagwid	1	*	Don't forget the fact that Obama was a Nazi because he wanted stricter gun control, and Hitler wanted guns taken from Citizens.
t1_dta8310	1	*	Maybe she prefers Mrs. Even though she is traveling alone and there is no way that she could be married. Can't imagine having to live with that.
t1_dta8vwu	0	*	Wow, you're an asshole. 
t1_dt9zlmc	1	*	It's literally the n-word in Germany.
t1_dtaj4cg	1	*	That being said, just toss out the fucking deodorant so we can get on our plane. 
t1_dt9tbxf	1	*	Bastard and Nazi are very different in Europe. 
t1_dta09y2	1	*	It's a well known saying and principle. And it gets a point across that *I* certainly agree with, although it's oversimplified.
t1_dtaleor	0	*	Read her piece on huffpo. It's all 'look at me I'm special I deserve special treatment and German police are nazis'.  Her background or stance on drone strikes is irrelevant.
t1_dtadv1h	0	*	You should call yourself Social Democrats rather than Liberals. Much more accurate and matches the rest of the world.
t1_dt9vfuh	0	*	Not all fascists/statists are Nazis though. They may be very similar in a lot of regards but not always the same. 
t1_dta1p9n	0	*	That's what I was thinking: She kind of described a male model. Young, flannel shirt with sleeves rolled up, tattoos, stylish hair...
t1_dt9wwoc	0	*	> Americas the best.  A bit ironic to say in a thread condemning stereotypes. Where I'm from in America the few special people who pull that shit are called ignorant.
t1_dtak4ll	1	*	Her article is killing me. She's obviously very proud of her use of big words and her education. My guess is she wrote this for herself to read.

t1_dta4prd	1	*	Observe all the hate.
t1_dta1ty6	0	*	What in any way gave you the impression that Germany has not learned from its Nazi past? Or that shame and learning from an experience are mutually exclusive? I don't quite follow your logic.
t1_dta2za2	1	*	Because american police are trained this way so they can kill as many people as they want. American cops are experts at escalating a situation. 
t1_dta7xc3	0	*	You're a nazi XD
t1_dtabe1s	1	*	+ a Hindi translation 
t1_dta088c	0	*	To be fair, he said that the 1 innocent person would be put to death, not incarcerated.
t1_dta1436	0	*	I can't imagine a way to make an opinion about drones contradictory to an opinion about airport security. The lengths people go to demonize drones is astounding.
t1_dtaiprp	1	*	It's as if you read ideological policing and your subconscious said you know what me? we should try this immediately on the next comment we don't like.  
t1_dta213q	1	*	I know
t1_dta4uh8	1	*	i don't live in america, but yes tipping is retarded
t1_dta0mch	0	*	Especially since being a nazi is a criminal offense, so she's basically accusing the police officer of a crime he hasn't committed. That's libel.
t1_dtapsf4	1	*	That link is a video...  How the fuck do you read a video?  Did you even bother to click the link???
t1_dtachst	1	*	What? Are you telling me that she tweeted that this airport security officer wasn't a Nazi, but actually something way worse? She sure likes to dig her own grave even deeper.
t1_dt9xtdw	0	*	As a Canadian, it's a common stereotype about the US police.

t1_dta9113	0	*	Lol what would be in an axis of evil cookbook? 
t1_dtfueil	1	*	Agreed.  My comment, having studied fascism, was merely a musing.  There is some irony in the actions of the German police.  But, I do not begrudge their decision.

t1_dtf8nz3	0	*	The issue is that calling someone a Nazi ought to be protected speech, but it's not.
t1_dt9wyd7	0	*	Well in Germany no police would punch you in the face for calling them names, so thereyago.
t1_dt9vmjx	1	*	To be fair, it's not his fault.
t1_dta7gdd	1	*	she should sue the institution that tought her, and give her a degree, because all she majored, she fudged up, big time.
t1_dtanhqy	1	*	She sounds like your average social sciences professor.
t1_dt9w3rq	1	*	well... rather be sued then be shot you know

t1_dszrp4y	0	*	This ~~guy~~ redditor meant English. 
t1_dszigck	1	*	It is tho, for the simple fact that you start to accumulate older, unproductive people. Although Japan could very well be in an exceptional place to deal with that, cus you know... robots.
t1_dszhn6i	0	*	Replacement rates are 2.1. And Germany, Canada, and the US take in a lot of immigrants.
t1_dszjevc	0	*	I don't see the irony. Artificial augs and replacement organs are more likely to be developed in a culture that rejects organic/intra-species transplants.
t1_dsztnvx	1	*	This probably is the most accurate thing I've read today
t1_dszxz4x	1	*	Sounds like a good timeline to me.
t1_dszyht4	1	*	Try dabbing on it like it's a hater. That might get rid of it.
t1_dszh4ik	0	*	oddly enough Rome was the one that put an end to it with the Julian calendar.  Most other societies did use the year since so and so was in charge method.
t1_dszgpg7	1	*	I honestly thought they were talking about the soft drink. I had to read child comments to understand

t1_dsv1qs9	0	*	Yeah, true. If you commit huge financial crimes, ruining hundreds of lives, you get a good spanking. Nothing too serious. 
t1_du1gr9l	0	*	Who said anything about eugenics? If Israel wants to make it a requirement for refugee status in their country they should be allowed to do that.

t1_du1hp6x	1	*	In a nutshell. Well put. I wish mine was a reply/expansion on your point instead of yours being a summary of mine. I hope people get it either way.
t1_du2iyau	1	*	Especially when the paragraphs are dealing with the same subject such as rebellion.

t1_dsklkci	1	*	Sure, then next time a Democrats in office you can join a conservative  scream at the sky festival (not a Democrat, just embarrassed by Trump being the face of the country). 
t1_dsksbof	1	*	I think that's literally what he was saying. That since he didn't win the popular vote he wasn't actually democratically elected.

t1_dt4soug	0	*	Yeah, so when some teacher goes crazy from screaming kids and snaps, it'll be even easier for them to unload. 
t1_dtuzxom	1	*	Anybody can go to an air and sea show to watch the America military might. I've been to several, and they almost pay for themselves. 
t1_dtvecfp	1	*	Perhaps I used the wrong word, but to believe that Trump's real reason for this parade is to emulate the French is not realistic. 
t1_dtzcqc3	0	*	have you ever considered that you are overworked? 
t1_ds9xii4	1	*	Because the way in which it's phrased, it sounded like he wanted people to die to make the fat orange man look bad.  An /s would have worked wonders.

t1_ds816oq	1	*	You followed them because your country seems to have a hard on for stopping the spread of socialism.
t1_ds929jj	1	*	I agree 100% foreign policy is extreme complex and nuanced, but our media likes to make it super easy. In fact its one of the things that remains bipartisan in the Trump era.
t1_ds7s3hd	0	*	*And then we replaced him with a theocracy, the problematic government Iran has today.   Seems like an important part of the story you're leaving out. 
t1_ds86xjj	1	*	You seem to be confusing neocons with the far-right.
t1_dsbbp4k	1	*	That would be the Taliban, while 9/11 was (allegedly) committed by al-Qaida. You know, the group of extremists that was supported by the US when they were fighting Russia.
t1_ds8g2mi	1	*	What about blablabla ?
t1_ds84wly	1	*	> Only person saying they have violated it is .. Trump.  ...[and the IAEA](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear/iran-once-again-exceeds-a-nuclear-deal-limit-iaea-report-idUSKBN1342T1).
t1_ds7znmt	1	*	Yep, so far when it comes to bombing innocent civilians in foreign countries Trump certainly sucks.  
t1_ds7t4i2	0	*	No body owes anyone shit. The current situation may not be the people of Iran's fault, but it sure as hell is their responsibility. Same as it is anywhere in the world.
t1_dt880ut	1	*	Bit more than that, but yes that's part of it too.
t1_dt8ij0c	0	*	I would never vote for someone who attacks Israel in any way, shape or form. Many people feel the same.
t1_dtqgr9c	1	*	Also just checking that you guys know that we(Finland) are eurozone which means that our goverment does not print the money or decide how many euros are in circulation right?

t1_dt3meer	0	*	Imagine if somebody referred to Obama as the turd in chief?  No problem making fun of skun color in current year though. 
t1_dsxs02b	1	*	This what I tell my girlfriend... No, no, no, see speed is relative so it was just fast for you.
t1_dsxr5ex	1	*	Yes, thanks for correcting me. I got the direction wrong, which made it seem logical. I guess it's the westerlies/anti-trades I should have been thinking about.
t1_dsz4cm5	1	*	I work in an airport and I appreciate all the extra security. TSA needs to to get better but I dont think were going to see these restrictions scaled back in a major way anytime soon

t1_dsa1vux	1	*	One year was already exhausting and unstable enough. I can't imagine he could possibly hold on his entire term, no less two.

t1_dsxh3oj	1	*	No the cladding wasn't illegal.
t1_dsxh1tp	1	*	 No, the cladding was incorrectly legal once upon a time and is now correctly illegal.  There was nothing wrong with using it back when these apartments were built.
t1_dtj5y55	0	*	No idea, and if it is actually written into legislation instead of just rhetoric Id say they would probably have an easy case in the WTO.

t1_dsdegs1	1	*	you forgot to tell that Japan and SK has the highest suicide rate among working population.
t1_dscrytz	1	*	You pretty much hit the nail on the head.  It's a lot of stress and pressure to put on someone during what is likely to be a very confusing time in a young person's life.  
t1_dscwioo	0	*	Yeah, shit's crazy over there.  How would you rate your overall experience?

t1_dsb6me8	0	*	My teeth are clenched and^my^legs^are^shaking.
t1_dsaadm6	1	*	I think it has more to do with whether or not theres anonymity on the platform. I feel like anonymous interaction is fundamentally not fully social.

t1_dsx5kj9	1	*	Because climate change is happening faster than predicted.
t1_dswmsbj	1	*	Yeah, but if they don't do it properly at the right depth and far enough off shore, it fucks everything up.  Given what we know of South African infrastructure projects, that's a legitimate concern.

t1_durx2ey	1	*	> Kids can and do access marijuana without a prescription.  Yes, they do. But state laws allowing medical marijuana does not change the availability of marijuana to teens at all.

t1_duyk1z0	1	*	Yeah, the bot actually included FOX in an earlier posting I saw.   So I don't think the bot is the problem. I think that the media is.

t1_du8h22e	0	*	Maybe because you're anti-semitic? Just a guess.
t1_du8hmc7	0	*	I was not trying to convince you of a thing. You said South Africa was doing so well after apartheid. Well, we all know thats not true. 
t1_du92g2o	0	*	Are you saying the burden of proof is on kiefking or papivebibpi. 
t1_du91qmw	1	*	From who? Israels receives only military aid from the U.S , not international aid.
t1_du8rxnk	1	*	Jordan and Israel do allow border crossing. Highly regulated and usually related to tourism, but they are allowed

t1_dv5szu6	1	*	I think my brain melted reading this.

t1_dv4wvz3	0	*	The sad thing about this is that anyone that knows how legit news sources work knows people like you are ignorant or you are actively trying to discredit things You dont want to hear. Shame on you.  
t1_dv53gv5	1	*	By that same logic then the Republican party also made the switch.

t1_dv4snta	1	*	The food wasn't very good, to be quite frank. 
t1_dv56vap	1	*	>Instead, the GOP roasted poor Carter.  That was at least a little bit justified. He was not exactly a George Washington tier President.

t1_dv4t1s7	1	*	Let's not make Hillary out to be a saint just because Trump is worse.  That's precisely how we got here buddy.

t1_dv4qgtu	1	*	Its true.  Source: Am America
t1_dtad8qs	1	*	Shes a psychopath supported by half a country of blind baby boomers. 
t1_dtz673u	1	*	It is literally the opposite. In the eu the small countries get to say a lot relatively speaking. That's how the voting system works.    Thanks for spreading false information 
t1_dtzlgw7	0	*	Basically that they would never accept ceding sovereignty to another country like that and people in the UK feel it's been done to them with the wool pulled over their eyes.

t1_dsfizhm	1	*	their coverage of the iraq war did it for me
t1_dsfaf8p	0	*	Yes, I don't like his attacks at media. But still, that doesn't make him the world's #1 oppressor of press freedom. That's just silly. 
t1_dsfjs58	0	*	Lol so you have no good points?
t1_dsfb5x9	0	*	He changed the application of the espionage act so it applied to journalist and used his DOJ to do so as a work around from passing an actual law that would have never made it through congress.
t1_dsfetws	1	*	Yes. Yes it is.
t1_dsfmfyd	1	*	K bye
t1_dsflnno	0	*	whats that mean, odd syntax
t1_dsbn369	1	*	This is very true. Even amateurs who just grow for themselves know about ph levels and what organic things should be added and flushed naturally. 
t1_dtekie5	1	*	Right, so that would thus put Hasan Hadith with even less credence since it would not be a 100% system of rankings of not all Sahih hadith are considered 100% accurate.
t1_dsqmc1y	1	*	Reading news headlines does not equal factual research.  https://www.good.is/articles/closer-to-peace-than-ever
t1_dsttcpt	1	*	That makes sense!   Thanks.
t1_dsno6mk	1	*	You have a *very* poor understanding of either this situation, or how the American government works in general 
t1_dsor1y6	1	*	Like these so called democracies don't have their own farms...
t1_dt4jef0	0	*	No, not really. A republican decided there's a secret society, and made baseless, unproven allegations about it. And dumb people lap it up & call it a conspiracy. Nothing unusual about any of it.
t1_dupqap7	1	*	That's a non-answer
t1_duqwjup	1	*	can't argue with that./s
t1_dv2ucdv	1	*	Or third party, if the Jill Stein voters voted for Hillary then she would have won. Also if you can make a democrat not vote then you have accomplished a lot.
t1_dv3qrfm	0	*	No I am not confused. MSM added pledged supers to the delegate tallies before they even voted at the convention. Supers voted for the other candidate rather than who their states went for. 
t1_dv3qgwo	0	*	Doesn't the rate of transfer depend on the distance of the two parties? Sending data over the Atlantic as opposed to say within the same city? Or am I wrong there?
t1_dv24xkn	0	*	1)No he didnt 2) No he didnt 3) No he isnt 
t1_dv38m9p	1	*	I'll rest easy tonight then.    But also, truth on the last sentence :(
t1_dtx7iu0	0	*	He compared Israeli settlements in the Westbank to the Nazis occupying Poland. How the fuck is that not equating the Jewish state with the Nazis?
t1_dtll8p0	0	*	Who lured her friend out to the woods so she could murder her..  What exactly is your point?
t1_ducugi5	0	*	Same.  I've no idea why they went from an open platform that I gladly used to watch where they can serve me ads to a closed system that I couldn't buy into even if I wanted.  So I streamed.
t1_dudc45p	1	*	DIdn't know.
t1_duj6xrv	1	*	No we have those here too, most people dont know about it 
t1_dttxhqx	0	*	Yes, the far-right propaganda does contain things relating to the far right.  Did you think the far-right propaganda would push communist ideals?

t1_dtfgqfy	1	*	Loki's punishment would be better imo
t1_dtf0n2i	0	*	Again as above, consequences are for  little people. G7 countries can do whatever. If Fiji sells passports they're threatened with sanctions. 
t1_dtlasok	1	*	That's not what I described at all. 
t1_dsbdpka	1	*	He might have confused it with the significantly larger 777

t1_ds3fwom	1	*	Not at all, ours doesn't work for human trafficking... Or it might?
t1_dtyj977	0	*	Given that China refused Taiwan's help when their own nationals were missing, I can only assume that Taiwan assumes that China sent that offer for aid as a joke.
t1_dtyma30	1	*	True, Too many cooks ruin the soup
t1_dty01b3	0	*	and so has everyone else. I bet you'd be shouting whataboutism if someone used your arguments on the other side. Filthy brainwashed hypocrites. 
t1_dtzkaqw	1	*	Maybe the relief would come faster if people actually allowed the government to build the mountain tunnels 10 years ago.
t1_dtz90k0	1	*	I had a great financial windfall, last week - the little African boy I was sponsoring was eaten by a lion!
t1_dty5qgi	1	*	No if China takes control of Taiwan it wouldn't be a colony

t1_du3nxl5	0	*	Assange has already served his purpose to Trump. He'll be disregarded as a coffee boy who nobody's ever heard of, the second he hits US soil.
t1_du4kffw	0	*	Yes, it is, and hence it is not the issue being debated. 
t1_du4hon8	1	*	To be honest, i can't blame Assange for having a certain beef.
t1_dsh99h2	1	*	I did read the article.  I'm the OP and it wasn't my question that you originally responded to.  Incorrectly I might add.  
t1_dshx7c0	1	*	Everybody is complicit. The question is: How long will this go on for?
t1_dtb8gw6	0	*	Maybe we should take the hint and bring the troops home.

t1_dtqp9sw	1	*	Interesting. Thanks
t1_dtqnmgx	0	*	Cotton is a plant that devastates topsoil. It's unsustainable to grow it in one location for too long, as evidenced by the movement of cotton westward in the days of North American plantations.

t1_ds8iybl	1	*	Bullshit.

t1_ds9b0t7	1	*	These restrictions were because they thought it's unfair for men that more women were studying.

t1_ds8jsnf	0	*	Or maybe he's just a neocon aka an imbecile
t1_ds9sz1h	1	*	Can you name one thing we have bidded them to do that Israel has done. Also Saudi Arabia threw out the American military bases a few years ago a pretty hostile move for a client state. 
t1_ds8dbzm	1	*	The Evangelicals definitely don't help, but the Israel lobby is the driving force.
t1_dspe7dz	0	*	It's close to half. But you get the fucking point right? Fusion of limitless Hydrogen is what I was referring to.
t1_dsp93yy	1	*	I wondered if the computers that interpreted sonar data would have been able to distinguish a man made engine or it would still be indistinguishable from seismic movements.
t1_dsp59xr	0	*	> Nothing America has can take out a Sunburn.  Yes, I'm *terrified* by late '70s Soviet technology.    I cannot roll my eyes hard enough at you right now.
t1_dspkobk	1	*	Underrated comment, right here.

t1_dspfpjm	0	*	Russia is not invested in MAD, theyre tactic is to retreat deep into their terrain.   Lots of supposed bases dug into mountains in Siberia.

t1_dspma63	1	*	Eh, a simple MOAB is enough to melt a bit of ice. A salted nuclear device would be too expensive.
t1_dspqu5c	1	*	That link doesnt contain underwater detonations. So very inaccurate. An air burst would be way more effective over the city.

t1_dsomnfj	0	*	Did you see the movie?
t1_dsp3xyx	1	*	Sir! The spheroboom is not for sale!

t1_dsp10my	1	*	*Iights of the false floor flicker on, five bad dragon dildoes stand mounted on the wall, casting their sinister shadows upon the future of the world.* 
t1_dsprxpq	1	*	If you want to know who is working against you then start with the people who matter the most, namely your own government. This is true for most countries, not just the US.
t1_dspamf4	1	*	I usually place my mines down when I need to cover a retreat  and don't want to be pursued too quickly.
t1_dsonpw1	0	*	Which we would have recovered from. Nuclear weapons make a *permanently civilisation-ending* conflict more likely, not less.
t1_dsqgmct	1	*	Lol. No. 
t1_dsp5y44	1	*	Agreed. I can see the components for this thing being shipped discretely over time to optimal launch locations where it waits until needed.
t1_dsq942g	1	*	Ehh, It's about time wall street finally got some justice.

t1_dsp6ouq	1	*	It is virtual certainty they had. The lead tamped one worked just as predicted.
t1_dspd10g	0	*	IMO, missile defense should receive a much greater focus. Create mutually-assured ineffectiveness, and then there's no point in having nukes.

t1_dsp9b4c	0	*	It actually burned dirtier at a lower yield.  That is the reality of dial a yield nuclear bombs.
t1_dsp56ah	0	*	What I think he means is, since Russia could no longer nuke the U.S., the only possible result to attacking them is the guaranteed destruction of Russia.
t1_dsp4p1c	1	*	> it tends to kill you as well  Tends to? That's what mutually assured destruction means. 
t1_dsq7nhu	1	*	The US can keep better track because Russian ships and submarines must to through narrow straits to reach open ocean.

t1_dss5vhu	1	*	Some of Nixon's most trusted staff made a pact to take shifts and never leave Nixon alone. They were afraid if he was left alone he'd get drunk and order a nuclear attack.
t1_dsrrzrn	1	*	And so has the current president... He can't handle it because he talks about our capabilities? Why have them in place if ignoring them is what we force our President to do?

t1_dsrsk7z	1	*	Cute.
t1_dss3tfp	1	*	Well put.
t1_dss4547	1	*	Sorry we don't rig our primaries like the democrats. The will of the people was executed. I don't like it. Most Republican establishment types like me don't like it. But it's what the voters wanted.

t1_dsrofsj	1	*	That is indeed an interesting question, and one which not even Trump knows the answer to.  The answer depends on who he has talked to in the past 5 minutes.
t1_dss6m99	1	*	Oh yeah, well I offered your wife money for sex and she declined!

t1_dsrv6gs	0	*	> You lost your chance to claim 'reasonable' after 2 years of constant ramblings, tirades, and lies.  Sorry, when did we switch topics to the Trump administration?
t1_dsrpcuu	1	*	Hey guess what, Un believes in gravity.  You better change your beliefs so they don't line up with a mass murderer. 
t1_dss0mq3	1	*	*There were no panties...*
t1_dss5oyc	1	*	If only typing it made it so!
t1_dsrosdb	1	*	Exactly. Kim knows he's done for, the moment his finger hits the button, he'd never do that. Trump however..

t1_dsrzu2c	1	*	Momma didn't raise no quitter.
t1_dsrolpd	0	*	He wouldn't be. Trump may be a fool but at the root of it all, he wants his people to love and admire him. KJU wants his people to fear him. 
t1_dsroel7	1	*	Because this is the US, and we dont have lunatics.
t1_dsrmdf9	1	*	Youre actually the only voice of reason Ive seen so far in the replies. Thank you.
t1_dsrot2w	0	*	Thats funny, I didnt say that at all. I said people will do anything to bash trump. In this case, its to agree with and enable someone far, far worse than trump in every aspect. 
t1_dsrngya	0	*	That's a scary thought. I hope nothing happens
t1_dsrpiyg	0	*	Less respectable, I think.  Like if Hitler told you not to smoke. Like.. I guess he's right but come on
t1_dsrrc4g	1	*	Yeah, no one except The Dotard has taken NK seriously.
t1_dss1wzy	1	*	This wouldn't apply in this situation anyway, because it was not an armed conflict between nations. It was an execution. Of internal persons.

t1_dsl6cbr	0	*	Ah, gotchya. That certainly explains the rising approval numbers (to levels now on par or better than the same amount of time into the Obama administration).

t1_dsl174a	1	*	I honestly do too. We are dumbing ourselves down. People ignore facts to appease their opinion. An opinion is becoming more important than the actual truth.

t1_dsc2l03	0	*	Everything turned out fine? People are being killed over this crap he started. Wth is a matter with you?
t1_dua64h5	1	*	And no one expects to be safe in those areas.  This is the only country where people ought to expect to be safe, in a school, yet still face being gunned down.
t1_dua6qg8	1	*	I believe you meant meese, or its acceptable alternative, moosen. Mooses has never been proper, I'm afraid to say.

t1_dua6k7x	0	*	Dramatic as in a clear characterization of whats considered a reality of life in America? School shootings every 60 hours. That fact is overly dramatic for people. Ok. Got it.

t1_dua65sq	0	*	So basically your saying gun control doesnt work right 
t1_dua637p	1	*	This is because American patriotism stops the moment they are asked to care about their fellow Americans. 
t1_dua58z6	1	*	I said the exact same thing earlier today.  It'll happen but being one of the largest brainwashed countries in the world... might take a little while.
t1_dua5ihi	1	*	They're still inherently jingoistic though, which is the issue.
t1_dua68jf	0	*	I agree. However, it is important to note the severity of the situation and the variety of shootings if now the discussion moves towards dis-aggregating the data.
t1_dua87f8	1	*	And a fake i.d gets you nowhere. 
t1_dua5rs0	0	*	Ok, so it's just three actual school shootings this year, by mid-February? That's totally fine then.

t1_dsciue9	0	*	Yeah its a place I really want to visit.  I'm reading an awesome book on the history of Byzantium, Constantinople, Istanbul now and its really piqued my interest.
t1_dsccou7	1	*	> If it's irrational why does it exist  That's the single stupidest question anyone has ever asked me.

t1_dtgrv76	1	*	>There's not that much of a real man thing to any form of hunting anymore.  Im no hunter, but its not that easy. Its very difficult to go out and get a deer.
t1_dtgzf06	1	*	Activists exist. You can change things if you tried, which people would if they actually cared and aren't just happy that someone they dislike for their hobby has died. 
t1_dtguhz1	0	*	Read what I wrote this has been answered about 100 times 
t1_dtgsde1	0	*	In Vancouver?
t1_dtgp7cf	0	*	A wild animal in its own environment is still on his turf, where it knows how to function; the hunter has to out-think and out-maneuver it as well a s setting off a boomstick.
t1_dtgrvrq	1	*	He's describing this: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/permit-to-hunt-endangered-rhino-sel/    Which is very different from cage hunting that some people are also confusing with this.
t1_dtgl14k	0	*	Alright, I can understand the sentiment, no hard feelings, but I don't believe its fair to attribute it to being a somewhat young redditor.
t1_dtgrn95	1	*	Didnt notice but at the same time, I am in no way surprised. 
t1_dtiwfc0	1	*	That still doesnt explain how *this* is structural/dramatic irony.
t1_dtgvqhp	1	*	Depends, if you go bear hunting with a Bowie knife thats a pretty big accomplishment if you get one
t1_dtgsgsg	1	*	oh yea, i've had everything...i live in tampa
t1_dtgvfds	0	*	You seem to be projecting intent here. Just because you feel insecure in your manliness doesn't mean everybody else does.
t1_dtgrzkw	1	*	 Big game hunter being hunted by an even bigger game hunter.  I'm sure this is a thing.
t1_dtgs1an	1	*	Well I would consider hunting with a bow to be a different thing in this context
t1_dtgsxrg	1	*	Where did I do that?
t1_dtgwp7i	1	*	Foot plots aren't quite bait.  [It's basically a garden designed to attract deer.](https://www.fieldandstream.com/articles/hunting/2012/06/how-create-perfect-deer-plot)
t1_dtgrwma	1	*	Well put!
t1_dtgs0co	1	*	I think bow hunting in the mountains is fairly challenging.
t1_dtgt3x1	1	*	that's some charles manson shit
t1_dtgsdb5	1	*	Yeah, and I want marijuana legalized because hemp is such a great material.
t1_dtgrqp4	1	*	Yes
t1_dtgrve6	1	*	I think hunters should have an choice to enter a Hunger Games style arena where they can hunt other hunters. Should have a great thrill of the hunt. Most dangerous game. :P
t1_dtgxri4	0	*	So what you're saying is, it's not Okay to have an opinion unless you directly act on it?
t1_dtgrwoy	1	*	It still can be quite challenging, animals arent all stupid. I for example didn't get a deer this year so I would say the deer won this year.

t1_dupqrux	1	*	On the bright side, the helipad business is booming I hear!
t1_duq06yo	0	*	Retirement age is already too high for lots of people here - we don't tend to live as long as the rest of the world, mostly because of our shit diet and work ethic.

t1_duqm85u	0	*	Many make the mistake of confusing govt/Constitution with the corruption of our elected officials
t1_dupiqia	1	*	But than we wouldn't be able to subsidize the rest of the world
t1_duq4lei	1	*	I don't know if we can take this data in count when we talk about the surplus. German budget is also 10 times (maybe more ?) higher but they still made a lot of surplus. 
t1_dupib0w	1	*	You're forgetting NATO and an entire arsenal of long range weapons that all these countries have.  You seem to think we still live in pre-WW2...
t1_duq81z6	1	*	You mean to say a German transportation system isn't on **time**?!!! Someone must be executed for this...
t1_duq2xn5	1	*	Helps a lot, thanks!

t1_dupgn8b	0	*	You can see my face in the reflection of yourself in the mirror that's creepy I'd suggest a psychologist to see why you see other people's faces in mirrors.
t1_dupwufu	1	*	Don't forget when questioned respond either three ways   1. Another vague answer   2. Tell them to do their own research when asked for sources  3. Do not respond ever again   
t1_dupihnn	1	*	Um, theyre called that because youre entitled to those benefits by law. Not because its a judgemental word 
t1_duq2og0	1	*	Obviously! 
t1_dupic0e	1	*	So much of it just gets circled around the DOD and defense contractors, and doesn't even go out to the other branches of the armed services.
t1_duphzww	0	*	Are they accepting American refugees yet?  
t1_dupi0o7	1	*	This dude knows what he's talking about

t1_duq9mo5	1	*	Dude, this isn't Kindergarten.
t1_dupm8kk	1	*	I am fine with paying for it as well, when did I say otherwise? I have at least 30-40 years left where I will be paying for it. 
t1_dupj138	0	*	Well, thank our Green Party. 
t1_dupn8gd	1	*	How about malaria?
t1_duph578	0	*	Wtf are  you talking about?!
t1_duq03m9	1	*	The boomers dont seem to appreciate it.  Its fine, they make themselves known very quickly and are thus easy to block. 
t1_dupdy4b	0	*	Some is but not all. Think of most devices you use, all started in America. A lot of the world's medical research is done here in the US, and most of the tech companies are located here to.
t1_duphxsc	1	*	You will because you won't be able to afford it otherwise 
t1_dupt0dt	0	*	Great reasoning 
t1_dupj51x	1	*	Judging by how architecture in Berlin looks this is very much true in a literal sense.
t1_dupi7cn	0	*	I'm no historian, they got some land and postwar subsidies though right?
t1_dupi1np	1	*	Sheeesh. A war appears. Russia attacks its neighbor and in retaliation we attack Chiiiiina. We know wars. We have the best wars.
t1_dupv01v	1	*	If you want to avoid people ramming it down with their vehicles, you should have poles on both sides

t1_dupkv9t	0	*	Your lack of foresight is scary.   You have absolutely no idea whats going to happen 20 / 30 / 40 years down the line.   Please at least attempt to use some critical thinking before you post. 
t1_duq8gkw	0	*	Really hope you guys start getting politicians who actually think about the future, not just the next election.
t1_dupr29z	1	*	I was supposed to fly into Schxf6nefeld when I first moved to Germany in 2010. Businesses opened around the vicinity and promptly tanked due to the shortcoming. 
t1_duprk9s	0	*	Sometimes hard to tell ;)

t1_duppse6	1	*	That exact train of thought has brought western Europe to its knees more than once.  Globalization or not, a strong military is and always will be a key aspect of geopolitics.  
t1_dupsehg	0	*	 This mentality is exactly what I'm talking about. Thank you for proving my point.

t1_duppg0r	1	*	I think the baseline are the Chinese 
t1_duq12ku	1	*	Please. 
t1_duqfvj9	1	*	Well he meant palatinate. So he was still wrong.
t1_duq7tqi	1	*	If we're lucky they'll open it in time for the European Cup in Germany!

t1_dupj2e6	1	*	Oops.

t1_dupfk72	1	*	You don't know the first thing about Europe, especially Britain.
t1_duqg8ri	1	*	this is true
t1_dupfn76	0	*	i've been in eastern Europe and the only infrastructure that isn't in shit heaps falling apart are the brand new highways with funded by the EU signs posted all over them.

t1_dupgq22	0	*	How much does it cost to run an army and navy? How is it irrelevant? 
t1_dupho5i	0	*	I'm pretty happy about not producing additional nuclear waste as well. And Germany is going to start turning off their coal plants as well with the new government.
t1_duqmz5y	1	*	You do charge for your support, in the form of owning parts of sovereign nations territory to use as military bases.
t1_duq65lo	0	*	I think a big contributing factor to the US always running a deficit is that it can. The other big superpowers are never going to call it on its shit.
t1_dupgzuq	0	*	>5 times better [...] than they were before   Before when?! Time scale is very important here. 
t1_dupmbhw	0	*	I still dont believe that the USA is a real place. It must be some kind of reality TV show to prank the rest of the world.
t1_duq48gv	1	*	I meant unfair as in America is the anomaly of developed nations. Its true that the US holds itself as that, but no one else really does, they just look like entitled twats.
t1_duphvk9	0	*	A threat to big Pharma. Here police force, lock these dangerous law breakers up. Also seize all their assets to sell at an auction. $$
t1_duphano	0	*	Then why do Europeans freak out when there's talk of the US decreasing its involvement in NATO?
t1_dupamfg	0	*	I know right, back when I did my semester abroad in UK its been ridiculously pricey already.. and now its catching up on me even in here where I thought the tobacco lobby does a good job U0001f92d
t1_duq0jjc	1	*	Eventually youll run out of place to stack horizontally, maybe Poland or France will let you put some there. I wouldnt ask Russia though
t1_dupp0nr	1	*	Ah but if we let them put tolls on those bridges and road they will fight over who gets to build/pave them.
t1_dups4o3	1	*	Thanks for the clarification ;)

t1_dupw4wy	1	*	Call it for what it is: Defense contractor wellfare
t1_duqdiow	1	*	Depends on what you mean. Munich is generally considered probably the second most important/largest city.   Although good luck finding anyone outside of Bavaria that would endorse that one. 
t1_dupxz2y	1	*	That doesn't sound like swamp draining at all! 
t1_dupzjs8	0	*	Information ammo isn't useful in this day and age when people ignore facts in place of their feelings.
t1_dupufsb	0	*	> The USAF subsadizes most if not all of the EU's logistics when it comes to moving European militaries outside of their home borders.  Yeah, because we don't have planes and plenty of ships.
t1_duplwmo	1	*	I had read up on it but missed the connection between the Green Party and the Baden-Wxfcrttemberg protests. Thanks!
t1_dupxi4q	1	*	That would be known as 'a course'.  Your lack of specificity in the words you use makes me think you arn't German at all!
t1_dupoocd	1	*	Rich people spend their money on luxury items and services. So we'll all find employment as yacht toilet perfumers and vomit readers (you wouldn't know what that is yet, it's only for the rich).

t1_duphv9b	1	*	The money lands in private pockets via military spending... it's called corruption.
t1_dupmjn8	1	*	Not to mention the fact European powers were trying to divvy up the middle east up not even 100 years ago.
t1_dur25c2	1	*	LOL. Americans crack me the fuck up.     
t1_duq053r	1	*	See also, communist Romania in the 80s.

t1_dupq559	1	*	And wa la, it worked. 
t1_dupl7zh	0	*	the country now differs from when 1535. Also, if you want the living standards of 1535, you should get your head checked.   Just saw your comment history, you really should do that head check thing.

t1_duq1r1y	0	*	Doesnt change the United States is the most wealthy country the earth has known, ever. Its an excuse and youre pathetic 
t1_duq3auh	1	*	But you can get from Munich central to a doner dealer in less than 2 which is all that matters right? 
t1_duqhm9y	1	*	Well it would most likely be either Hamburg or Munich. Hamburg is the most populated non capital city in the EU and Munich has most of the finances of Germany.
t1_duq00k5	1	*	I'm crying
