t1_dua9fzb	1	*	I'm not sure you know what a straw man is... given your demonstrable lack of understanding of maths.. and lack of critical thinking... LOL
t1_dtmo2hy	0	*	Well, we did it many years ago.  The economic benefits of Panama Canal still resound today.
t1_dtlowd4	0	*	Because its the overwhelming truth? Very few people consume heroin or crack occasionally, they are incredibly addictive substances.
t1_duc5cg5	0	*	It's correct but entirely missing the point where eating the dead bacteria is really not good for you. 
t1_duc8bbv	1	*	And even then they don't really survive in the traditional sense as they were never alive to begin with.
t1_dubu4qh	0	*	and jesus said he was the son of god.   and? 
t1_ds9aji7	1	*	Cuba does have a lot of doctors. Guess Fidels foreign policy was a success. 
t1_dufsn03	1	*	>the cowards way out  you spelled victory wrong.
t1_dsvprks	0	*	> Anne Frank topic  LOL. You didnt actually read the article, did you.
t1_ds97q37	0	*	When making puns like this, it's important to make a plan and stick to it without any deviations.
t1_du3aj9f	1	*	Your statement that there is no conflict is wrong
t1_dtjbaz1	1	*	That's my point, thanks for proving it. It is an important issue, but the media never talks about it. You literally can't name a single one lmao
t1_due0lze	0	*	Just to be clear I don't think anybody should be offended by it.  
t1_dtxsnef	1	*	Is reading more than a few words for you tough?  If you're handicapped or only have limited level education let us know.
t1_ds9hdtn	0	*	Thats extra context and expanding the original point.   again message me when it happens
t1_ds4xbvf	0	*	No you are doing  that because one quote mentions how REFUGEES GENERALLY aren't more criminal. This was thrown in there to appease people like you.
t1_dstjcae	0	*	That Israel does whatever it wants in Area C doesn't mean it was stipulated anywhere in Oslo that it could do so. It just does, like a thieve thieves without anyone's permission.
t1_dtijx7v	0	*	I'm not, I'm suggesting that we stop pretending our judgement of what's morally acceptable is or should be universal.
t1_duuref2	0	*	African slave trade still going strong. 
t1_dutq1ne	0	*	Try reading what I already told you a few comments up.
t1_duvvk1k	1	*	A vaccination contains the same antigens that a pathogen would present to an immune system. There is no difference to the body between the two.
t1_dutp7hc	0	*	I'm agreeing with you
t1_duv22yy	1	*	Yeah no. You could have the truth be a rock flown right at your face and you wouldn't accept it. Keep having dead viruses injected into your veins and see how that works out for you. This is an omen.
t1_dv4lxrw	0	*	I'm interested in when you'll notice  a. I'm a different user that's fucking with you  b. I'm replying directly to your public comments  c. You have significant insecurities you need help with.
t1_ds5h64t	0	*	Asking doesnt factor into it.
t1_ds2j112	0	*	Have a happy new year buddy. 
t1_dtogxni	0	*	No, fuck him for being needlessly hostile. 
t1_dtq8e1s	0	*	Yeah, no lying and defrauding.  lol
t1_dtofa7c	0	*	Shouldnt you give up by now? Youre not correct. 
t1_dtob52n	0	*	So, there are no policies?
t1_dto2cdu	0	*	You made an incorrect assumption about me being in the bottom of the barrel.  I just don't think people should have to live shit lives, sorry.
t1_dto669p	0	*	Yes, like the poor CEOs of GM, Chrysler and Caterpillar who lied and said they wouldnt move manufacturing overseas. 
t1_dtrl3l2	1	*	DJ Trump
t1_dumm3up	0	*	Also said there's no evidence it effected the election
t1_dum22co	0	*	it quite literally isn't.
t1_du0f3jy	0	*	If I cared more I'd continue. You completely ignore actual facts for opinions. It was great chatting with you though. 
t1_dus1v6r	0	*	A few years ago, someone wrote an article called Schrodinger's Rapist about how all men are rapists until proven otherwise.  Just poking fun at a very negative world view.  
t1_dus3pfm	1	*	All i was stating was the fact that Germanys murder count and Japans are comparable.  
t1_durchdo	0	*	The Arab Spring was the fruit of US democracy and freedom exporting efforts. Like south america in 70's and 80's. 
t1_durzd04	1	*	So yeah my original comment is some funny shit because it's not like I  know better U0001f602
t1_durloah	1	*	Good point.
t1_durle18	1	*	Very well stated all around, and even with our similar pasts I couldn't have said it better. I 100% agree as well.  (Looks around nervously for pigs to fly)
t1_dsflq3c	0	*	[You should take a look at this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgCuCeY_3Z8)
t1_dthj7m8	0	*	Yeah you just provided two different quotes and attributed them both to me as the same one.  That's what makes you a liar.  And a creepy e-stalker as it turns out, go pester someone else.
t1_dtfwdco	0	*	I'm telling you, some of it was out well before then.  but again, still no idea when it was actually created.
t1_durz46t	0	*	What the groups think is not relevant to my opinion.
t1_du9oma4	1	*	My solution is to take away the vote from uneducated people, essentially.
t1_du8q7kq	1	*	Probably U0001f641
t1_du91940	1	*	sorry I thought it was implied... they don't have the right to have sex without responsibility for the consequences, is what I meant.
t1_du8yu7z	1	*	Me too, I didn't check your edit before psoting! Ha, have a good day!
t1_duaozsp	1	*	Oh yes, I didnt necessarily mean interesting good! I would hate my parents to move at all, even in the future when Im not living with them. 
t1_du94zb8	0	*	sorry I thought it was implied... they don't have the right to have sex without responsibility for the consequences, is what I meant.
t1_du90vte	1	*	? What part of what I'm saying is making up an argument of yours that isn't your argument?
t1_du8guqs	0	*	Have you tried doing research? Good job on the ignorance.
t1_dtplszl	0	*	It seems to me like you're just mixing pundit opinions together and acting like it's an FBI statement. FBI has been pretty consistently quiet on all this. 
t1_ds3e4px	0	*	Whatever you say Neville.
t1_duokyu3	0	*	Like it or not, recognition is crucial in international law. And Israel's claims to the West Bank are rejected by the entire world for good reason. You can't take foreign territory by force.
t1_dsktw08	0	*	Ill send a memo to my deep state buddies that your upset.
t1_dt70mjc	0	*	I never suggested adjusting for anything.  I clearly stated more people.  Look man, I'm not American. But even I'm sick of all the hate they get for no reason 
t1_dtvcf4c	0	*	No, I just can't take 30 something year old men who spell boy like a 12 year old trying to sound cool seriously...
t1_dtw3hzs	0	*	We are acting exactly how we naturally act, selfishly aware of our selfishness and rarely changing our behavior. Blame nature I suppose, for creating us in this way. Bad natural selection, bad. 
t1_dtw3zmd	1	*	Eh, doesn't really matter to me :)
t1_dtw3i7j	0	*	Because it's not really a question that can be answered. Also because you don't actually care you just want to stump me.
t1_dtwh9ug	1	*	Christ man, Im not talking about the meat industry. Ive watched Food Inc too. Im talking about the basic principle behind killing an animal for food vs killing it in self defense. 
t1_dtvhp3o	0	*	Nice display retardedness, congrats 
t1_dtw3ski	0	*	Wouldn't it taste like the seasoning then though?
t1_dtw6gt4	0	*	For now? Britain has and will always be in europe, unless you were personally thinking of moving it to another area somehow
t1_dtvrj3p	0	*	Eating infers that you were killed. Normally elicits a negative reaction.
t1_dtvvjw8	0	*	The other commenter's point is that non-modern people don't have the luxury of using absolute energetic efficiency of their food as a metric.
t1_dtvk8jl	0	*	The there the question about people volunteering to be eaten aswell. 
t1_dtvjxpd	0	*	Britain will still be a part of europe after brexit
t1_dtw9b3v	1	*	Dude calm down it's possible that people in this world don't always share the same opinion as you. 
t1_dtvdyoj	0	*	I like the anonymity because I need the freedom to be wrong, and my ego won't let me do that if people know who I am IRL. nope, not from UVA. im in colorado :)
t1_dtvoibg	1	*	Cremation is just barbecue gone wrong!
t1_ds39xeq	0	*	So you evaded a simple question.   I know you're BS'ing. Just calling you out.
t1_du5vdjh	0	*	So, you have nothing to say to me other than repeating what you said to me? Go and be a stinky troll somewhere else and start showing a little bit of respect to Marxists on Reddit from now on.
t1_du8v4ih	1	*	Biological Infections are not the same as viral infections such as colds or the flu. Vit C unfortunately doesn't prevent rotted teeth.
t1_dskbguf	1	*	At that point you might as well just use a missile 
t1_duo0ycj	0	*	How did they rig it? Were they stuffing ballots?
t1_duo1s2e	0	*	Seems unfair to let illegals off the hook if people are waiting decades then, would you agree?
t1_duqh7v6	0	*	> illegally emigrated to  DACA kids werent breaking the law! They were children. Prosecutors cant charge babies.
t1_duo2eea	0	*	And how has that wall building come along?
t1_dunp7s3	1	*	Then Im saying your nation, not you individually, are exploiting them and its funny that even what passes for a liberal in your country has been duped by it.
t1_duo1o95	1	*	I agree with your sentiment, but they cant.
t1_dt3a6bh	0	*	I'm not Jesus.  But I'm sure you would downvote him for being edgy. The Romans would agree.
t1_dt3abdv	0	*	And he spoke very dismissively of the dudes in his contemporary money temple
t1_dttc7ld	0	*	Seems like the point is people should be treated like toddlers and need someone to tell them what to do. I disagree with that point, people should use common sense 
t1_dttetvk	1	*	The problem is a lot of Americans don't think of the less fortunate as unlucky. There think they're all just lazy and didn't pull hard enough on those proverbial bootstraps
t1_dttc6an	0	*	It's so high because so many people choose to go to the ER for things that should be treated at a medcheck clinic 
t1_dttjc6z	0	*	>50k is also far from bankruptcy  Just shows how little you know what you are talking about. ~40% of Americans couldn't come up with $1k in an emergency, much less $50k
t1_dtw1gcy	0	*	Maybe I *am* crazy. It must be my socialist hell hole of a health system that's stopping me from getting help.
t1_dttcbg2	0	*	Yes. My federal taxes + health insurance premiums + deductibles equalled 10.1% of my income last year (that was the total for my family of 5) 
t1_dttby6h	0	*	Do you think anyone that has free health care is even close to that. You get what you pay for. 
t1_dttzgc4	1	*	Well, if that's the case the only thing that matters is that I won. No need for me to care about a sore loser.
t1_dttoapr	1	*	Are you saying the articles i posted didn't happen? That they are made up?
t1_dttb3zj	0	*	The vast amount of people who go to a hospital actually don't pay.  Hospitals are usually working with a deficit *before* paying out.
t1_dtush14	1	*	Fair point
t1_dttclqi	0	*	We have a progressive tax structure so the rich do pay much more. I made $130k though, so I'd assume I'm in the upper middle class though 
t1_dtuclnb	0	*	Come here and see for yourself. That's absolutely madness man. Really.
t1_dtu83gt	0	*	Yeah, if you don't like American taxes, just live somewhere else! Gah, so much complaining.
t1_dttm4io	0	*	No benefit? The article a few posts up just said the benefits outweigh the risks by 100 to 1.
t1_dtu2y7x	0	*	Thats a deep hole youre digging mate, looks like youre having trouble getting out
t1_dtuehty	1	*	Okay
t1_dttlj3q	1	*	Good point. Judging by the downvotes there a lot of them here too. 
t1_dtto2d1	0	*	When I contract someone to build an addition to my house do I have absolute power over them? 
t1_du1yw1n	0	*	So congrats, your country is big and rich and powerful.
t1_dttjf48	1	*	He went bankrupt, it literally bankrupted him
t1_dttf4ls	1	*	I'm not an economist, I haven't studied this situation. All I'm saying is it's not an inherently bad choice.
t1_dttc5uh	0	*	Well hopefully you or a loved one be fortunate enough not to.  If you do though?  Well, hope that NHS helps you out.
t1_dttgmj6	1	*	You can send chat messages on here? TIL. PMing now :)
t1_dttly53	0	*	I had a circumcision aged 30.  I dont recommend it.
t1_duovs6g	1	*	'cause you're a boring predictable troll and I'm not interested.
t1_duosowt	1	*	Yep. 
t1_du3i55y	0	*	Ok, well let me know when people have actually applied for these jobs at minimum wage levels
t1_dtdweix	0	*	So do the subsidies get worse if you have dirt under your fingernails?  Do Trump coal country voters have a different set of facts than actual empirical reality?
t1_dtg0l8j	0	*	So you're saying because Nazis aren't in power, it's not okay to be anti-nazi ? 
t1_dtdzdib	0	*	He's literally telling his own crowd how much he hated drain the swamp but it played well  Also boo country limits 
t1_dtehcwy	0	*	Yeah, you generally compare comparable things. That's sort of the point.  Nobody's defending police violence. Come down.
t1_dtwqwn2	1	*	Having a majority does not equal doing anything you want without oversight. Just something you should consider. Jesus Christ...
t1_dtevpmi	1	*	Agreed
t1_dupg1sm	0	*	So then youre the other option I mentioned.
t1_dv5ntp8	0	*	Yes, they started after what happened to Saddam who had *no* nukes.
t1_dsasm0i	0	*	Shalom
t1_dsa96un	0	*	I want the houthis to starve. Not the civilians. you dont care, you are just looking for your team to win and stick it up to Saudi arabia. Thats why you support a hostile force. 
t1_ds9i53k	1	*	Yes I'm sure Iran would risk everything just to kill some random civilians.   That makes total sense.  
t1_dv18wqe	1	*	Ps. This right here is where he won
t1_duptzck	0	*	See, this sounds like Holocaust denial. You won't even acknowledge historical facts.
t1_dtbnx4z	0	*	> Generally that comes after Exhibit A, chief.  Exhibit C.
t1_dtd34im	0	*	Absolutely not, no. 
t1_dtbr7e1	0	*	Pride in ignorance. An endearing trait to some, I'm sure.
t1_dspvg4h	0	*	Well do you listen to intelligent people or morons?
t1_dszsyow	0	*	Aren't you pleasant? I wish you well. I can see we're done here.
t1_dsducj4	0	*	At least you're honest.
t1_dstnqg8	1	*	True dat.
t1_dse8w7o	0	*	It looks great now that we're doing something about the problem, so actually you're disproving yourself here.
t1_dt6rsp7	0	*	Ok, so I and literally every other leftist I've interacted with are wrong in not considering ourselves liberals?  Good to know you're watching out for us.  I'll take it to the next antifa meeting.  
t1_dt7k38z	0	*	i highly doubt A CEO is sitting there working their ass off trying to get enough money to barely scrape by.
t1_dt7iyvz	0	*	Changing interpretations does not change the quran lol. Unless you are ahmadi or one of the smaller sects and they are pretty much dismissed by the majority of muslims (sunni and shia).
t1_dt6r3ns	0	*	-_-' Well that's better than I expected, at least. Still a depressing lack of morality though.
t1_dt6xwos	1	*	[they arent](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/left-wing) 
t1_dum0a55	0	*	I think the sinn fein would disagree, we'll have to ask on their experience 
t1_dum5btn	0	*	Please provide me a quote from MY comments contesting his points.  Please go ahead... I'll wait.
t1_dtwyzra	1	*	Yeah Im wary of people as a whole, especially racists since I live in the Deep South, kind of scary seeing alll that hxe8re but its reality i guess, lifes just not fair 
t1_duix652	0	*	lol/
t1_dv0wkt4	0	*	Ive been around bombs when I was in Israel, still not a violent person  Again, they choose to be violent
t1_dv0og33	1	*	Unfortunately they exist
t1_dv0ofdg	0	*	Nope, but if you think these assholes will stop you are very naive
t1_dsqzqf1	0	*	Here's a summary then: I am right, you are wrong.
t1_dsozxdc	1	*	redacted
t1_dsoaclq	0	*	Well yeah it sucks and probably won't ever be great but at least we have something. 
t1_dsnpepv	1	*	My eyes don't roll hard enough on this. Aloha. 
t1_duuo8xf	0	*	Britain belongs there becuase historically they were and the people voted for it. 
t1_duv4w26	0	*	I think i missed your point
t1_duukynf	0	*	You're out of your depth, son.
t1_duvfv1i	0	*	http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-faithless-electors-2016-story.html  PLENTY OF TIMES!!  Did you even look it up or are you just arguing to argue?
t1_duur994	0	*	From the UK, moved here a year ago. Lovely place, shame about the lack of vegan/vegetarian restaurants, though.
t1_duurgt9	0	*	Wrong.  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121211163545.htm Science isn't like basic math, there are other factors to think of.  
t1_duvmum4	1	*	That was worded poorly. Past administrations have absolutely condemned what happened to native Americans and have ostensibly made some, but not enough reparations. 
t1_duuoxag	0	*	Less words and more substance. So yes, you still got me beat.
t1_duuk9h3	0	*	So intelligence decides how much empathy an animal deserves? so i take it you also feel mentally handicapped humans are worth less than normal ones?
t1_duuq9yx	0	*	Quincixf1era, right?   But what did she do there? Surely they're really boring. Even if you like hiking it's not like there's interesting scenery.
t1_duugo5x	0	*	Holy shit you are so full of racism and nationalistic pride. Just, calm down for a second lmfao.
t1_duul748	1	*	Okay then treat every person you engage in debate as your inferior and insult your way to the top. Good luck.
t1_dt7kg09	0	*	> Well it would if we assume there's bias, but a. there might not be  Bias against women in the work place has been pretty well established over the course of the last century. 
t1_dt7lbft	0	*	And that is the way it should be.
t1_dtx8pg0	0	*	There is no use of arguing with someone who is clearly an supporter of genocide. 
t1_dshpol3	0	*	What are you going to do about it?
t1_dsgzz9n	0	*	Oh gosh. Are you not aware that South America exists?
t1_dsh28w2	1	*	Never disagreed with you. Just elaborating that while he supports theirs, his approach is markedly different. 
t1_dshrmpo	0	*	Wages should be set by the market, not the government.
t1_dshg19c	0	*	No it isnt. People lived just fine before the wage increase. That already disproves what you said.
t1_dsgyseh	1	*	That's not the same thing at all. Slaves were forced and were given much worse, or are in the countries that practice slavery like libiya 
t1_dsmhvts	0	*	Nazis used much more powerful government to create huge social programs, they made sure every German had a job and a safety net. 
t1_dshakqu	0	*	> Anyone can make up some bullshit  I've never agreed more with you.
t1_dsgyy0c	1	*	Made as much as sense as your previous points
t1_dsh449w	0	*	yes, and?
t1_dshnkt8	1	*	Just holding it down, the usual
t1_dsh5jiw	0	*	Surviving does not equal living. If you don't see a difference there really is not point it continuing.
t1_dt8osgk	0	*	Alright well lets just end it there because we would just be going in circles at this point. If pedophilia is still a mental illness in your opinion then consider me fucking saaaaaaane.  
t1_dsvaga0	1	*	I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything other than how I, an individual, interpreted his statement. lol
t1_dsp3evz	0	*	We're the greatest. The points you raise are rare.  [if you don't love it leave it](https://youtu.be/uIxBmyRQlwQ) 
t1_dssq6lf	0	*	For a neurosurgeon, you aren't every bright ... but what do us radiologists know?   
t1_dsn1qy3	1	*	I thought you didnt like false equivalency?
t1_dsmw29w	0	*	How? I'm just saying, I don't recall. Isn't the same as I know it didn't happen.
t1_dsndmsu	1	*	Lol wow
t1_dslyvrc	1	*	He didn't sound sure of himself at all.  Bad hotel interior. Sad.
t1_dsmh011	1	*	where did i say racism doesnt exist? Actually i (elsewhere) in this thread said the exact opposite, that it does exist. 
t1_dsm0hyr	0	*	You seem to be self identifying as an idiot right now.
t1_due18wi	1	*	To stop them from dying or to stop them from existing? Because yes. 
t1_due17pz	0	*	Thank you U0001f60a   That explains the split in the nation I suppose, almost happened with Vietnam as well. 
t1_duemnil	0	*	Even if he had done that, it's right there in the first one.
t1_due24u2	0	*	This is also not true....again the USPS is a non profit and it doesnt get donations.    Youre confusing non profits with charities.
t1_dudyb1k	1	*	Often I put remaining my calm first when not understood and retreat to elephant gifs. 
t1_dum1kb8	0	*	Okay, picture Trump's ideal United States. Roads, schools, some public utilities, security of a sort, economy, etc.     Would you say Yes, I'm getting what I want out of this government?
t1_duskufz	1	*	Haha that's not an expected trait with these guys. 
t1_dt9ynms	0	*	Again it is illegal in Afghanistan and done in secret or private settings. How do you imagine the actual investigations and enforcement going by the American forces? FFS.  
t1_dsqe5ov	1	*	Thanks for just quoting me. Unfortunately you forgot to make any sort of point in your post. Quit trolling. 
t1_dsqxqht	0	*	I have never seen someone defend a comedian so vociferously.  If I was Bill Burr, I think I'd be looking at getting a restraining order. 
t1_dss0vww	0	*	Coward? What? I wasn't even thinking about aggression or anything. Just about not playing games with words to be a dick to people. That's what a weasel does. 
t1_dsqrrhn	0	*	The entire incident. You do know what a hoax is right? A lie represented as fact. Which in this case was reported verbatim.
t1_dsqcf7f	0	*	If you don't have any specific questions then just read the comment chain.
t1_dsq8j05	0	*	Oh, you mean the places that aren't Christian majority? Well, if that isn't the most coincidental thing I've ever heard....       /s
t1_dsqzk59	0	*	So are you just going to run away from the question? How were those stats you gave me confirmed? Surely in the context of a crime you mean a conviction, no?  
t1_dsrb8lc	0	*	Sounds fair enough.
t1_dsqn7rl	0	*	Minorities have higher rates (more than double whites' rate) of poverty. They move more frequently. Sure, any individual can be poor and move a lot, but minorities are disproportionately affected. 
t1_dsqb6cc	0	*	But what are you gonna do about it?
t1_dsqe8pr	0	*	quit stalking me and commenting on discussions you're not even in, creeper. 
t1_ds5fvuj	0	*	Not upset one bit, just surprised by your idiotic logic. What's next, the angels feed the NATO troops haha 
t1_dt1f4pd	1	*	>your  You mean you're.
t1_dsy55ec	1	*	I told you im fine with government especially for things that help people and im fine for taxes when theyre used for their intended purpose, so yes that would be great.
t1_dt1nido	1	*	Wow, what a rollercoaster of a comment. You're making me regret engaging you this far, but I suppose it was an interesting experience. Have a good whatever kind of life you're having. 
t1_dt1ofbm	0	*	Where have I said that I'm a capitalist? Again, that old noodle spitting out smoke, trying it's darndest to work. I'm proud of you, boy
t1_dt1c96a	1	*	Keep it up, champ.
t1_dtgupsy	0	*	Wow. you just offered infinite hypotheticals as a counterweight to the horrors of humanity. That's not an argument of any sorts. 
t1_dt1t8mi	1	*	Hopeless.  This will help, but I bet you won't even dare to disturb your bubble by watching this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZC0JOYYWw
t1_dt3vi01	0	*	Sorry I can't hear you past your own argument. We are measuring systems by their macro results now. Capitalism is destroying the world.
t1_dt2awc8	0	*	ya.. because capitalism brought prosperity.. and then his communist idea CRUSHED that prosperity and brought misery..
t1_dt1drev	0	*	He was certainly bundled into the crowd by somebody?
t1_dt2ihlz	1	*	Neither of those definitions require universal suffrage.
t1_dt1u9bu	1	*	Yes I do. But have *you* really any idea about American politics? Or just any politics in general?
t1_dt1duwl	1	*	The problem is that the economy isn't reliable anymore.  Home ownership used to make sense when you could work your entire career with one company.  Now 'creative destruction' is the norm.  
t1_dt1omc2	1	*	The EPA wasn't reslly Nixon's idea, he just didn't stop it from happening. Not sure about OSHA.
t1_dt2knly	0	*	>Often, children who get lead poisoning live in old homes that are dilapidated or under renovation. They pick up paint chips or dust and put it in their mouth.xa0  Hey! Just like you lmao
t1_dt1abua	0	*	No, its not the same because you are making up definitions on your own. 
t1_dt1ue14	1	*	Dude, calm down...
t1_dt1kb6m	0	*	See, now you're all mad about something else, *and the fact remains* that trump rejected a deal with bipartisan support.  That's objectively true.
t1_dt18fip	0	*	I'm not even arguing that.
t1_dt1uj0g	0	*	Okay, prove it.
t1_dzqkv2n	0	*	Except they didnt. So I guess youre not a part of that
t1_duhn3d1	0	*	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/flynn-russia-sanctions.html  He was suggesting that they would be easy on Russia before Trump was even in office. That's a big no-no.
t1_dv46mfo	0	*	Okay, but there are policies outside the U.K. where that is not actually how it works.
t1_dv6dxod	1	*	It's not hard to find images of rhinos within ten feet of armed guards and completely chill with it.
t1_duis5ne	1	*	I want to think a bit of him lives on in the computer systems of whoever inherited Anubis armada... forever in our hearts!
t1_duignc0	1	*	To be sure, there are uncertainties associated with reconstructing past climates from proxies, but they are not so large as to render proxies worthless, that is pure ignorance on your part. 
t1_duhvtsm	0	*	So you trust instead the setup we've been going with for decades, which has resulted in some of the worst effective health rates and highest costs in the world?
t1_ds76544	0	*	and yes the evil businesses that provide a product at an affordable price. oooh ooh bad bad businesses.
t1_dsn76fq	0	*	Those are some pretty good laws that the US tends to ignore sometimes.

t1_dtcm0w4	0	*	Do you have a source for slaves at the Potala Palace?
t1_dtcihfl	0	*	Apparently numerous countries have relationships with Taiwan.
t1_dtc7sjr	0	*	I guess we will never agree here. I'm just telling you we (as a white guy born in middle-America) are taught in America that Taiwan is an independent country and a great ally to America.
t1_du1o99i	1	*	Thats fine. Enjoy your conspiracies. 
t1_dubgla0	0	*	The youtube videos pointed to the real data.  The nasa data is adjusted.
t1_dv6cr0g	0	*	So we give them props for the good economic things they do, but lame excuses for the disasters they created.  Sounds like an apologist.
t1_dv0bqh9	0	*	To flip that argument around. Without military support the government is no treath to the people. 
t1_dv0dv3c	0	*	Pls enlighten me how a rabble of 10000 people with hunting rifles at best can take out even one tank with infantry support, or heck just a TUSK equipped tank on its own

t1_dt5np5h	1	*	Hey don't sweat it, it's what coolwienerguys do.
t1_dt007zk	0	*	Nah it's not that I'd rather do that, it's that it's an ethics violation and you seem to think this guy is just peachy.
t1_dt02diq	1	*	>nothing is even less acceptable  I've provided you with a list of other things to use as leverage. This isn't that hard, and it's not my job to spoon feed it to you.

t1_dtnrwg7	0	*	Huh?
t1_dtn8sl1	1	*	well if you don't want to answer my question then I guess we're done here. unless you have some more questions for me about my personal views on vaccines and how they came to be
t1_dupuoo7	0	*	Of course. That is life, in general. Rolling with the punches!
t1_dt4frlf	0	*	I know :( But I can wish.. I still need to go to a game, but yknow I can't afford that haah.  Are they? I haven't watched them much, hopefully one of the teams will do good
t1_dt55osk	1	*	Then you're still annoying as fuck, but it's not illegal (and shouldn't be).
t1_dujp3zb	1	*	Awh, you think I'm cute? Have never called my Dad or Mom Pappy or Mommy, don't believe all of those stereotypes buddy.
t1_dt5ecv8	0	*	If you say so, Stedenko.
t1_dtctmuj	1	*	No they weren't.
t1_dskixzb	1	*	Those are some very good points. Thank you.
t1_dsjufz8	1	*	you failed to capitolize. yes. capitolize.
t1_duem1fx	1	*	Accusations are pointless without evidence. You're telling me trolls have the power to swing an election? You don't think the US has ever pushed disinformation in order to get who they want elected?
t1_dutf4f8	1	*	...  Amazing.  I cannot tell if you're doing this on purpose or if it's natural. 
t1_ds8ekyj	0	*	Cool. Their healthcare system is better, their labour standards are better, more vacation time, and more buying power.
t1_dsa90dw	0	*	That's the fucking dumbest strawman I've read all year.  And I'm asking why business owners don't get a guarantee minimum profit then? Cause they take the risk. Why don't we do that?

t1_dtdaakt	0	*	Again, none of this is or would be a law. Its goal setting. 
t1_dtd3ols	0	*	Or seeing that it is bullshit, not buying into it, and having a different conversation.
t1_dtedu45	1	*	I don't think you know what specific means.
t1_dtgp5at	0	*	OK, so? 
t1_dtg5mg7	1	*	I do focus on my shithole countrys problem. Thats why although we are a shithole we arent crapping on the world economy or threatening nuclear wars.   Cheers. 
t1_dtde7d0	0	*	Seriously though, he's not an autocrat. What could he have done which is within his power as President?
t1_dstw842	0	*	Probably weird countries with not the best healthcare 
t1_dupul2d	0	*	I don't have time to answer all this now, but I will try to later today. One thing, maintaining the chaos was an autocorrect mistake. Containing is what I meant to type.
t1_dtaflzy	0	*	> literally implied   
t1_dta5oiy	0	*	It seems males are dumbasses everywhere and die more often. 
t1_dt8ugbm	0	*	It's not just me.  There's a reason why philosophy majors have one of the lowest expected incomes when they get out of college.
t1_duipzcn	1	*	I'm defending people keeping wealth they currently have.
t1_duigj95	0	*	But my point was that the US was under attack too, and still managed to help its people. And survive.   One system is obviously more stable 
t1_duki1rq	0	*	Which rules and enforced by whom?
t1_duigky1	1	*	Maybe the only solution is to give a vote only to a country with a minimum of population. That way you force the small ones to unite.
t1_duilf53	1	*	I guess you didn't even read the first word. It was no 
t1_duinbzi	1	*	I haven't read anywhere that describes middle class as becoming multi millionaires and retiring in their early 50s. 
t1_duic62v	0	*	Congrats you're an idiot if you can't follow a conversation or delineate  whats being talked about therein. Guess you must be one of those dismal educated fellows the other guy was spewing about. 
t1_duign6h	0	*	You have given nothing but anecdotes and projecting your insecurity. Show some facts instead of doing nothing but claiming all data is worth less than your anecdote.
t1_duifzch	1	*	Absolutely! Thank you. You've just shed some light into my day with this comment.   
t1_duik0ju	0	*	The fact you think we're living under a dictatorship at all is what's telling.  Everybody should note everybody else is a bot on Reddit unless they state otherwise.
t1_duivj0c	1	*	Right. Northern lower West Michigan is what the news people call it. 
t1_dv3krr1	0	*	>If our research is doing a lot with that small amount of money, then we should invest more in that to maximize our ROI.  You are assuming that more money = more productivity

t1_dshba77	1	*	I do live in a high catholic area , where about 30 percent of my highschool was catholic. If you wanted to observe special diets you brought your own food.
t1_dtd069z	0	*	Well that's why the world is fucked. It makes no difference if you go vegan if you have children. You can never undue the damage. 
t1_dtcugkt	1	*	Very true and as it tends to be, corporations/business practices corrupting what would be good things, or at least taking advantage for profits until forced to stop.
t1_dtcuody	0	*	So people on /r/childfree are psychological eunuchs?
t1_dtdwlrn	0	*	So you admit to writing paragraphs?
t1_dtd6t34	1	*	You just gave my intrusive thoughts about the physics of a bullet crashing out the upper left side of my skull.
t1_dtcosp2	0	*	Compare the no beef to the ones below
t1_dtcuxem	0	*	What part of the earth's lung did you not understand? I not even going to bother with you anymore, I should have stop talking to you as soon as you said humans aren't ruining the planet.
t1_dtcsfek	1	*	If you think all potato chips are vegan then you either haven't read the ingredient listings on many potato chips or live in a country where dairy isn't subsidized.
t1_dt0brfa	0	*	Are you saying they are legal citizens?
t1_dt1emc8	0	*	lol whatever, like I said, it's not 5th gen. It's a SU-27 with a body kit.   There's a reason no one is ordering them. I hope Russia enjoys the 12 prototypes they will make over the next 10 years. 
t1_dsmtfek	1	*	ah ok you are one of those libertarian no government people, glad to know I can ignore your opinion because you are legitimately crazy.
t1_dslzvhy	0	*	Good for you, but this isn't about you or what you care about. It's about the larger picture of what the american constituency seems to care about.
t1_du2t3dq	0	*	How many missiles was it carrying? None.  How many bombs did it drop? None.  How many people did it kill? None.  And you think it is OK to kill people over that? Com'on, where's your moral compass?
t1_dt2huv0	0	*	I'm having a laugh at yours, so you're still at a disadvantage.
t1_ds80gnv	0	*	Well maternity leave should be granted for man as well, so a good reason why this should move ahead.  Which rights can mother claim that are connected to birth?
t1_dupvdif	1	*	Then perhaps they should raise taxes and work on educating the poor like every other social democracy.  Give preference in sale to blacks.  Just taking the land from the current owners is not the way.
t1_duq01jk	1	*	Do you do ever supply resolutions or just smugly and incorrectly refute others efforts.  I don't really care, I just don't like you based on your actions.
t1_du38bfj	0	*	> Yeah my argument is sanctions for invading and taking territory by force isn't a sign of strength.   So you argument is to do nothing.    
t1_duq00dn	1	*	My understanding was that only methamphetamine was linked to neurotoxicity, looks like I've got some reading to do.
t1_dtqzvst	1	*	You missed a period at the end. First lesson is free. Plus, you can't make a stand alone sentence with parentheses surrounding your phrase. Lastly, you're not very smart. Enjoy the weed though.
t1_dtp31x6	0	*	The article says he was killed in a ground fight, if he was brandishing the weapon or fired first then it was justified, but the article is not that specific.
t1_dtpwoxv	0	*	Obviously that's the law. I simply said I disagree with that law. Why did you even reply to me in the first place if all you wanted to say was the law is the law. Pathetic
t1_dtptesp	1	*	There are no details, only speculations. 
t1_dtqejy2	0	*	Churchill stroker confirmed.  Maybe your countries cities should be razed to the ground for your bombs dropped in the Mid East in which  many civilians have been killed.
t1_dtp34xk	1	*	Like I said, if that was the case it was justified, and not a war crime.
t1_dseee0g	1	*	I never said that. I said bitcoin incentivises nodes by rewarding miners. Who run nodes (not full ones). Try to keep up. 
t1_dtn4fe6	0	*	lol keep on fucking that chicken.
t1_dtmwrdp	0	*	Well not necessarily someone asked if she agrees and she does. That's fine, but it doesn't immediately dictate policy. 
t1_dtn0jfd	1	*	Have fun with your primary students I guess.

t1_dsgufdx	1	*	In what way? What do you want an example of?
t1_dsm11t1	1	*	I mustve replied to the wrong comment.  Whatevs Im baked af and over it 
t1_dtegloa	0	*	as i said, i will show a map, and then you will show your kurdish map. your fake kurdish map doesnt prove afrin is majority kurdish. its pointless.
t1_dtfih6h	0	*	I learned Spanish as a second language. I still know a few words. Maybe we should force the world to speak one language so we can all get that money.
t1_dtee40q	1	*	Irrational bullshit. Back it up with legit sources or gtfo.
t1_dtosotn	1	*	And I've also said there are dozens of historical examples that aren't like Iraq.  Turks wiping out Armenians, for example.
t1_dtnxjcc	0	*	Nah, that's baklava. You're thinking of the capital of Slovakia. 
t1_dutsa3t	1	*	They didn't compromise!  *a few posts showing them compromising with sources later*  That was *fake* compromise!
t1_dusmp7j	0	*	He literally just told you that he's for decriminalization. How is that the same as maintaining the status quo?

t1_duslj5h	0	*	We have background checks and there's nothing wrong with training. You haven't proposed anything controversial. 
t1_dusojm0	1	*	Good point.
t1_dusk1zx	0	*	Mexico needs US trade far more than the US needs Mexican trade. They would lose a trade war decisively. So lets go back through the cupboard and leave Narnia behind. 
t1_duslsn5	0	*	Ah yes, the same way anything in government has been paid for so far. It's mindblowing how many people want higher taxes so the government can waste even more.
t1_dusly29	0	*	So now your only argument against giving teachers the option to carry a firearm in school is sarcasm.  Thanks for the discussion! 
t1_duu21rb	0	*	Gerraro is a nice place to live??
t1_duu75e1	1	*	I mean I cant say youre wrong, thats for sure 
t1_dv33jw2	1	*	Move those goalposts!!
t1_dv3du2t	0	*	You said it was a totally absurd comparison. A man much more knowledgeable and experienced than you says it is apt. You need to address that, as well as the fact that is an illegal occupation. 
t1_dv2vk29	1	*	ofc not, westerns are known to be huge hypocrites because they are far away and cleaned their continent hundred years ago.
t1_dskhhny	0	*	Have fun defending Trump the rest of your life.

t1_dv1a0jm	0	*	So you have just basically admitted that you are spewing bullshit. OK then.
t1_dv30j6v	0	*	Realist. I'm watching the world and see Russia's direct influence. Nothing is gained by pretending they are weak nobodies who will soon be gone.

t1_du97wlk	1	*	> I'm getting downvoted because I spoke the truth, and truth hurts   It is SO cute that you actually believe that! 
t1_du9jocf	0	*	That wasn't the issue in the first place. If you go back, the original comment was suggesting that you require people to inhabit them, not be owned by Canadians. 
t1_du8oyql	1	*	So what you are saying that whilst unprecedented, it is not impossible?   I guess we agree after all. 
t1_dt23hhk	0	*	In that case I might as well vote CDU since they're the biggest party. I don't think I should give my vote to people I completely disagree with. The result would still be a negative outcome.
t1_dt8niae	1	*	Deficit rose in 2016 to $585 billion from $438 billion in 2015. My bad, meant the other way around.  I dont trust anyone who marries that, sorry.
t1_dt9uvl3	0	*	Doesnt change the fact they source the IMF release in the article?

t1_dt8r37a	0	*	That links to electronic collars lol.
t1_dtzgf5q	0	*	It's still a limit placed on freedom of expression.
t1_dtzn9lg	0	*	You clearly didn't read anything about wehrhafte Demokratie...  The German constitution before WW2 didn't include that concept, so comparing that time to now is pointless.
t1_dtx1rxs	1	*	A source that has been vetted and considered credible by the historical/academic world. So if Israel is genociding people, I want to see a source thatll make it in the history books.
t1_dssuu4q	0	*	>Marijuana prohibition is perfectly logical  No it's not. Schedule I is for drugs that have no medical purpose, which is blatantly false of marijuana.  >kids prosecuted for [sexting] is as well  WTF?

t1_dsecgdv	0	*	Just because they figured out how to make a nuclear explosion doesn't mean they have the device smaller than a house. It's a hard science to master.

t1_dtc4ak0	1	*	> People seem to forget that basic research  Unfortunately I think ignorance is the bigger issue.

t1_dsv3dsp	1	*	Google shows a 50 star flag to me
t1_dsud5ym	1	*	Again I'll have to disagree with you.  I always found data to be rather boring/repetitive.   Also when you said the series are all full of characters like Garak I was expecting more than one example.

t1_dstvarq	0	*	> You've already seen the source.  It says nothing about the olympics.     And again, they are an ALLY. Of course they are not going to directly contradict what Trump says and rip into him. 
t1_dsdagdf	1	*	I mean, yeah, it is, especially among the more conservative stripe who don't like what recent popes have been doing.  Fascists gonna fasc, they don't care if there are rules explicitly against it.
t1_dsroc8y	0	*	Depends who you're comparing them to. Compared to other current countries in the limelight, absolutely. 
t1_dsnkzw8	1	*	indeed it is but <.01% and slightly less than <.01% feel pretty much the same if we're being honest
t1_dtvc1lm	0	*	>The **imposition** of purdah by a sizeable segment of the would hurt others.  It's always been illegal to force others.
t1_dtuu0jq	0	*	No. Just like you can't wear a ski mask in a bank. It's also to protect them from sexist cults.

t1_du8onp4	0	*	Thats what liberals do
t1_dudblk8	0	*	Yup Im an asshole
t1_du8noya	0	*	No, you don't. People who move their goalposts away from their first position rather than conceding they were wrong are not looking for honest debate. Your game is old and obvious.

t1_ds7wtsj	0	*	If by NK you mean Kim and the ruling circle. Ordinary people? Doubt that.
t1_ds8lly8	0	*	You cannot compare 20th century policies to 18th century rule. Your argument is null and void. Furthermore it seems we agree that it was an undeclared war so im not sure what your problem is.

t1_dtt962d	0	*	Yes it is. No they're not, at least not yet.   Why do you keep making baseless comparisons, you're for censoring the Internet and censorship in general. I'm not.

t1_dt337ov	0	*	How a president is suppose to behave is irrelevant to me. All that matters is his platform and results.

t1_dsm6rnc	1	*	sorry replied to the wrong comment/
t1_duknglr	0	*	Youre the dickhead who doesnt understand the transitive property. Ill take your bait once more though. The relation to trump is that Manafort was his campaign manager. Get it?

t1_dut6jau	0	*	No that's a dumb parallel to draw.
t1_dut36f8	0	*	Again, this brings us back to the question of when this has worked in the past 100 years. When has it?

t1_dv2fqlm	1	*	Please don't. While I have enjoyed the content of your responses I feel your pain having to explain the same thing continually. The person you are replying has an alternative understanding of truth.

t1_dtd8dm5	1	*	Yeah here in America we kill all political opposition too.
t1_dtc55mu	0	*	So you're saying that in this imaginary scenario, people's families members are being slaughtered, and it only affects them as much as a rainy day affects you? That's your argument?
t1_dtq3av4	1	*	Duh, you can't hear text. 
t1_du11je5	0	*	I offer you the same advice.   In the future, don't call people leeches and insult them for having a different outlook or opinion on a social media platform.  Good talk.
t1_dtzkop2	0	*	Yes exactly that. That is conservative ideology at its core. Heirarchy is just. It's not reality. 
t1_dtzbk40	0	*	Oh, hun, I'm sorry.
t1_dtzy7ik	1	*	I mean yeah, she testified that he raped her, and then she was paid a fuckload of money to drop the charges. Good enough for me.
t1_du0n7uo	0	*	So I guess her advisers misinterpreted the law, is that your argument? Lulz.
t1_du0e4r8	1	*	Nope, pretty happy with where weve landed thanks. Ive got to go and do real world things but good luck with the apologism and defence of fake news vending.
t1_du1bt12	0	*	Where is the funny?
t1_du06zjg	0	*	Totally understand. Youve sparked my interest though.  Take care!
t1_dtzz309	0	*	Lol claiming it's a fact when it's clearly not objective, it's 100% dependant on whether you believe that he'd lie to cover his ass, funnily enough most sane people do.
t1_du0tj2z	1	*	Where's my assumption? That I claimed that you believe he can do no wrong? I'll just refer to a previous comment. 
t1_dv61419	1	*	It's actually Russia Today and they mostly do news that we are too scared to cover. Apart from the interference though and the Trump / Daniel Baldwin ass kissing

t1_dtou6c3	0	*	And from where do you make that assumption?
t1_dtohuai	0	*	He did it because he's a fascist piece of shit.  Do you spend a lot of time explaining why islamic attacks happen or do you only do that when it's a right wing terrorist?

t1_dugmaas	0	*	No but you seem to be suggesting the protesters want to block ambulances intentionally, leading to deaths. Did that actually happen or not?
t1_ds3w0lr	0	*	No I'm comparing group think to group think. But yeah you are right. We should all support things not knowing what they are.
t1_du4393h	1	*	I mean Trump spilled state secrets to the Russian Foreign Secretary in the Oval Office and you are talking about Hillary running an insecure email server...

t1_ds59ybv	1	*	He is responding to your arguments, he said sjw are irrational, you said well yeah there are a few nutjobs in every group, he says well there are more than you think.
t1_ds5a0ra	0	*	Not my fault that not only you interpreted in a way that gave you a reason cry, but then you chose to keep going to feel justified. 
t1_ds50jry	0	*	But you suggested Trump > Hillary. I never said Hillary was a savior or any of the other stupid shit you're saying. What I am saying is that Hillary is objectively a better fit for office than Trump. 
t1_ds42vpu	1	*	I agree, I should have replied to a different post to have this discussion.

t1_dt3ebbd	0	*	> if you give give ANY focus on retribution then that undermines the prospects of reform  No.  No it doesn't.  Maybe in your Disney-addled brain, but that's not how the real world works.

t1_dtzkgw0	0	*	Because that would be causing suffering. I thought we agreed on that.
t1_dtzkiid	0	*	Cows, pigs, and chickens have been bred to be food. And they would be food for predators in the wild as well.
t1_du00hef	0	*	I didn't bring up morals. You did. I said there no way to stop animals from killing each other and the world cannot operate without killing animals.   
t1_du0p5rf	0	*	Whats your point?
t1_dtzmrf4	1	*	Thats not true, things can change, just beacuse normal farming practices were the norm doesnt meam things havent changed. its not easily verifable like 'grass is green'

t1_du0lsqq	0	*	Didn't the USA land a thingy wingy on Mars and China did not? The comparison was between China and a Modern Western Nation not between China and SpaceX?

t1_dt4regv	1	*	My fault, I shouldn't have compared regular Universities in China to ours.
t1_dt4a3fh	0	*	No, I made judgement that has nothing to do with race, and you replaced nouns with racist stereotypes.
t1_dt4xokf	0	*	Thanks but doesn't really matter.
t1_dtg15sc	0	*	We prepare it the same way. I just do an extra step because I'm not a piece of shit and I respect the life I had to take in order to eat and survive another day.
t1_dtoj5za	0	*	Im not sure we can believe these people when they make those types of claims anymore. Adam Schiff was clearly full of shit when he said that repeatedly.

t1_duyr1of	0	*	Is that what you feel?
t1_du43uum	0	*	And also because the monarch chooses their own name when coronated.  Charles is very unlikely to become Charles III given the record of that name.
t1_dtb18wl	0	*	The worst is I didn't feel like I should voice my opinion. But then I did anyways and she just thought it was funny. 
t1_dtmwp9j	0	*	Maybe if we had universal education I would have a better grasp at grammar.   HURR HE MADE A GRAMMATICAL ERROR EVERYTHING HE SAYS IS FALSE.   Go back to /pol/

t1_dt8dde5	1	*	Which I think is great! 
t1_dtbm9mv	0	*	Or its like playing chess with a pigeon.  It is really exhausting.  Not worth my time trying to straighten out retards on the internet. 
t1_dtboinn	1	*	There are a LOT of possible private keys. There is no guarantee that you will generate a globally unique private key. But in practice the odds are so low it isn't worth worrying about.

t1_dt0jh2r	1	*	Yes whites outnumber blacks 10:1? I know that's what I said.
t1_dt016va	0	*	Then mind your fucking business, if this has nothing to do with you. The fact that you *don't*, makes me think you're up to something else.
t1_dsz7952	0	*	Cool then go.
t1_dtrc7ss	0	*	China is learning from *other* countries' mistakes.  China cannot have a western style democracy right now. But it might be able to in the future. 
t1_dttl5dv	0	*	And why was Hong Kong the gateway? Because they had a working commercial law system that the mainland didn't. Otherwise why not immediately open the doors to all the cities in China?

t1_dt8v9kf	0	*	Your inability to locate a positive trump article is caused by many factors, the press hating trump is one of those factors.
t1_dt8z1kg	0	*	The fact that you think reality is an asshole means you have no grasp on it. You're literally too stupid to realize you're stupid. You're just embarrassing yourself with every reply.
t1_dt9qtoc	1	*	Thanks! Burning is an art!
t1_dt8v1yz	0	*	Thats their reasoning but it doesnt change the disturbing fact that the press is against Trump.

t1_dt0kgwp	1	*	You are describing dictatorships that do not last.
t1_dus4j4i	0	*	More importantly: that country needs to be as diverse as America. Because some countries do have a low crime-rate, and they're 90%+ East Asian or European.
t1_durrz9e	0	*	Also, instead of you just attacking me from the start like you did. You could've asked for any stats I had. We'd be here faster without all the bullshit.

t1_dudj9ye	1	*	A dichotomy is the exception, but ok, you win.
t1_dudmecu	1	*	Upvotes and downvotes mean shit.  How bout you act as an individual and try to have a civil discussion?  Something that used to separate this site from others.

t1_du1wdhl	0	*	And he signed it.  That's an overt action he took against Russia for the election interference.  You said there was no evidence he took any action, I proved otherwise.  Thanks for playing.
t1_dtyr0ll	0	*	He also wasn't in the Ecuadorian embassy at the time since this was in regards to the Manning leaks in 2010. The guy is talking out his ass about a subject he knows nothing about.

t1_dsfmnwn	0	*	Be specific because at no point did I wish death on anyone as you claim
t1_duypm32	0	*	It appears to be true. Not significantly, but it's higher. Much of the US population is on government-provided healthcare. Everyone over age 65, all the poor and disabled.

t1_dufbc6v	0	*	Then why were the Russians working to get Trump elected?   And I did look at Uranium One. It was a bunch of nothing. Get your head out of that muck you read.
t1_duvq1jb	0	*	You too.
t1_dsis4sd	0	*	What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
t1_dtx4mzh	0	*	Highly doubt that. If they want to keep their arctic territory from Russia they better buddy up with the US. Plus biggest trading partner is the US.
t1_dtxq56e	1	*	no we aren't. Which sucks. The EU is definitely the more reasonable ally but the US is such a massive trading partner that the order of our allegiances would probably be UK > US > EU

t1_dt2xj54	0	*	I do get that, and for that it's good.  However, it's also unfairly targeting people who have a legal addiction.  It's also an easy tax grab just like grog.

t1_dsw2t4o	0	*	No worries dude. 
t1_dsvmcy1	1	*	Social Security would be getting so much more in taxes if Americans were paid more. Too bad illegal immigrants depress wages and take jobs.
t1_dsvx8ea	0	*	I agree with your disagreement. That being said I can't fix the world
t1_dsvybn1	0	*	Im also going to guess you are not from America bc there is no law here that forbids you from negotiating for your salary or benefits.

t1_dsvdn46	0	*	Right. Because going from Obama to Trump is *such a logical step and I just don't understand it*.
t1_dsv1ipr	1	*	You should vote for Trump if you agree with his policies. But as far as I can tell most/many of his policies stem from xenophobia and have no logical foundation.

t1_dsv5l9o	0	*	You didnt.

t1_dsgtikk	1	*	The point is that things aren't always as they appear to be. There's a 99.99999999% chance things are exactly as they appear to be in this case. But without a good fair trial we can't know for sure.

t1_dsjqucr	0	*	I at no point in time implied he was hitler, only that he's supported by literal nazi's, and debatetly okay with it. Why do neonazi's and other white supremacists like him?

t1_dtezhcz	0	*	it'd be a shame if someone could go find the conservative position on immigration, like during Brexit, that's so difficult though
t1_dtn6zbm	0	*	Your entire post history describes a person who should not be in the intelligence community unless you're getting coffee for the real people in the business. 
t1_duaes6b	0	*	It's fine if you disagree on that aspect but I think you can then agree that the EU is not just a trade and interstate broker.
t1_duc1n2a	0	*	being in the EU is a massive economic military and political boon; throw that away why? 
t1_dubb083	0	*	Like I originally said. Anyone who is greatly effected by brexit probably has bigger issues to tackle. Everything you have said could be a potentially issue, however it probably won't be. 
t1_ds3cuvk	1	*	Ya did, tho
t1_duv54q3	1	*	I don't think you have any idea the gravity or feasibility of what you're saying.  Brexit is a great example of why it's a horrible idea.

t1_dua96mx	1	*	They were closed minded and abusive.  Was that my fault?  No.  Did I choose that?  Also no.  You seem to love blaming and punishing people for the actions of others, do you think that's fair?

t1_dt5fwcq	0	*	Exactly. I think dude has either had a terrible one off experience of he's just lying or hates other Americans. 
t1_dt5gcf4	1	*	You got anything to actually back that up because you and I both know you are talking out your ass.
t1_dt5yjpi	0	*	Meh, I had to click to see more comments to even see this far down the thread. It's just you and me here, buddy.
t1_dt5sb8r	1	*	I think Neil Young went on to say that Skynard's response was pretty reasonable and his song might have been overdone. Or something like that.
t1_dt1tsih	0	*	 It's not an accusation, it's an observation.
t1_ds9w1ab	0	*	So you think because there is a divide between Indian Hindu upper and lower caste so they decided to cut a part of their land and send all the Muslims there? What's the logic you are using? 
t1_du514sl	0	*	I like how you avoided answering the question.  Let me ask you again in bolder letters:  #What do you think is his closest business tie with Russia?
t1_du4zroj	0	*	Ok. I see tons of we buy shitty houses signs in my area so clearly someone is making good money flipping

t1_duchcjx	1	*	Hmm, I'm not entirely convinced, but I get your point.
t1_du59pua	0	*	Well... can't educate the unwilling.  Keep hating on Trump for no reason, then.
t1_du5dq2r	0	*	Not to mention the gigantic pile of stupidity he pulled with El Chapo that could have very easily gotten lots of people killed.
t1_du4o3vg	0	*	HMHMM! I've got you now internet troll! My semantics arguing is unmatched in THIS universe! 
t1_duapldx	1	*	Look, I don't really want to get into a circle of rebuttal, which is what's about to happen. Attribute the economy to Trump if you want, I just think it's shortsighted.
t1_dv18usx	0	*	How is it not? This is what I would show someone if they made such ridiculous claims. Denying that is far more sickening than seeing the pictures. 
t1_dtdbo4v	0	*	I never said that either. 
t1_ds3ra89	1	*	Just going to add: Standing for the flag or not. A whole country goes insane because Kapernick kneeled. Which also made the president rampage on twitter. So yeah, freedom of speech and expression.

t1_dsxbbqi	0	*	I think it should be legal in the first trimester (as the fetus cant feel pain)
t1_dswuwc6	1	*	Why? Rip supreme court?
t1_dswqbq6	0	*	At conception it isnt human.. its a fertilised egg. It TURNS INTO a human. Dear gods please take a biology course 
t1_dswuh6t	0	*	That's not covered by our health care, so it's not something I would worry aboot at all.

t1_dszx639	0	*	Fuck it's like talking to a brick wall. I'm done.
t1_dsxrwv4	0	*	And they are free to do so, they just shouldn't receive government funding to protest current laws. Which is the whole point.
t1_dswq90k	0	*	I am, which is why I'm proposing it be illegal for men AND women.
t1_dswq34c	0	*	What even is this argument.
t1_dswpkl4	0	*	I can have that opinion I just won't get any government funding lol. 
t1_dswmzqj	0	*	Right so there's your answer to your question. There is no set answer because it doesn't ultimately matter as bodily autonomy is more important. 
t1_dswqajt	0	*	Then I propose this question: how is campaigning against abortion discrimination? It still isn't.
t1_dsx71as	0	*	Abortion is objectively, across the board, more unethical than being responsible and doing what It takes to not get pregnant when you don't want a baby. 
t1_dswxj5m	0	*	Yes - the human rights crap. The (potential) mother has ALL the rights. And as you described, a clump of cells that are neither conscious, nor sentient have precisely none. See how easy that is?
t1_dsz78rs	0	*	LOL. Sure. 
t1_dsy7j3m	0	*	[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7rdwxs/trudeau_bans_antiabortion_groups_from_summer_jobs/dsxelb2/). Now you can keep reading in a circle and being angry.
t1_dswpxgn	1	*	Interesting take. I'm sorry you feel so strongly that the only way you can adequately express it is by degrading those who disagree. 
t1_dswpf3r	0	*	Their statement confirms they would support both. I would wager the label of evil fits them nicely.
t1_ds3yq09	0	*	Yes, disagreeing with you makes one a lunatic. Have fun copying and pasting from Wikipedia.
t1_ds3je0y	1	*	that's not fair. it's not a non-argument, just because I don't understand the intricacies of debate, that doesn't mean we can't discuss.  but whatever i guess
t1_ds1lhmz	0	*	Someone doesn't know what rep in republic means...
t1_dsm9793	0	*	what, you want them to automatically turn into a democratic government with a 50% illiterate population base?   that's working out so well for the united states?
t1_ds86ssr	1	*	Where in said headline does it say they drill off our beaches 
t1_dt9wnxe	0	*	No.  I said the statement Democrats had 8 years is wrong because congress wasnt under democratic control.  It wasnt a Democratic government, it was a mixed power government.
t1_dt9xn6o	0	*	I am not confusing anarchy with anything. I showed evidence of his extreme economic views, quit repeating the same thing when you ignore what I wrote.

t1_dt9lryh	1	*	Its like watching a 4 year old lose an arguement, next he will be rolling around on the floor
t1_dtaleiy	0	*	Except no amount of evidence that shows collusion would sway you. *if* the investigation comes back and says no collusion, I would be satisfied. 
t1_dt9i9e3	1	*	My sincere condolences. 
t1_dt9bxs4	0	*	The basis of your question hinges on whether or not you think you can confirm a third hand sourced report. I'm rejecting your basis as you can't confirm a third hand sourced report.
t1_du85y3q	1	*	They do. But as you may not know, a war with an army is a little different than a war with a militia who hide behind the civilian population -> no restrain
t1_dsw6zis	0	*	Tldr: there are no benefits to abortion, it is murder point blank and should be treated as murder. You are an adult, and your actions have consequences. Cya

t1_duds2dr	0	*	There is illegal speech in America too.
t1_du4yo22	0	*	>Germany had two dictatorships during the last century. None of the countries you named had a similar situation during that time.  What do you suppose that indicates?
t1_dtth4e2	0	*	unread  too long
t1_ds77bzt	0	*	Let's say you're correct, it really does re enforce Pakistan's belief that Afghanistanis don't want peace.
t1_ds7oc6q	1	*	Cool, I'm glad to have been corrected. I genuinely had no idea Afghans thought so highly of Indians. Wish the two the best of relationships :)
t1_dtz1rry	0	*	If you delete them ofc it's easy  Do you offer any jobs?  I'd be interested to work with you guys
t1_dth5qiv	0	*	They got a permit to protest, not a permit to counter protest. 
t1_dv4je3p	0	*	I never mentioned Mueller. You bringing him up is a non-sequitur.
t1_duq19tq	1	*	So again who decides what cultural attitudes are supreme ? Man or God or White people as I know for some people white people are god

t1_dsypby6	0	*	That incoherent mess at the 2nd grade level? Yeah, unfortunately I did. 
t1_dsv7ory	0	*	So they publish crime stats but don't say if the criminals are natural born or foreign born?  And that matters to you why?
t1_dt02ybl	0	*	That's like saying the person being mugged will just sell their jewelry in response to the mugging.  You can't sell stuff that's being taken from you.
t1_dsjj6ou	0	*	I can't help that Europe is such a shit hole... do something to make it better but don't expect us to bail you out.

t1_dskn6ti	0	*	Theres a concept of tyranny of the majority that you should concern you here. 
t1_dsmrkvy	0	*	I'd disagree, most American conservatives I've met have been very socially conservative.
t1_dskv1v1	1	*	Totally agree
t1_dsjwioc	0	*	That sounds 100% made up. You could back it with a well sourced citation if youd like.
t1_dsjclfp	1	*	Lol dude, that show has gotta be the cheesiest show for tourists in the whole RLD
t1_dsjk7by	1	*	And you're fucking wrong, thats what everyone is trying to get through your thick skull. The Dems have issues, quite a few, but republicans are straight up evil scum. 
t1_dsjm5m0	0	*	That is completely unrelated to anything I've said.
t1_dsjklav	1	*	Yes, thats the advantage of a parliamentarian system. There are more tribes. 
t1_dskddu6	1	*	They sure do.
t1_dskixni	0	*	Definitely not a Republican, but it doesnt take much to realize that objective truth is still selective truth. Bias is impossible to remove, so it must be identified. 
t1_dsjgrlj	1	*	Yes. It's important to keep numbers [like these going](https://i.imgur.com/ffYOstm.gif)
t1_dsjjqqt	0	*	Sure you are. You're defending that both sides are the same, which is just plain wrong, on so many levels. If you can't see that then, by association, you are defending them.
t1_du8i8yq	1	*	Dude come compete with me for points on the other side of reddit lol. I'm like a white guy in Harlem in the 80's here. 
t1_dskq6hd	0	*	This is not really true. Freedom of speech is not protected nearly as strongly in Europe is in the US, generally.
t1_dsjir59	1	*	ah ok. I don't know that much of the micro politics in USA and barely any of the macro, just wanted a clarafication, thanks :).
t1_du1r8ve	1	*	Yet you still haven't made a point. You just want an argument. 
t1_dv70igp	0	*	it's like talking to a wall.
t1_ds45op6	0	*	Did I say I don't hold my government responsible? I am saying both the government and the people are responsible, unlike you who think as long as an act is legal they have no responsibility.
t1_dv78rev	0	*	>Uber drivers aren't employees. They are contractors.  Yes that's the childish little game Uber is playing in order to get around labor laws. You've fallen for it. Well done.
t1_duryots	1	*	And you mine, do the same my friend.
t1_durm2ga	1	*	Im not talking about outlawing guns. Just regulating them better.   If that means giving up my right then 100% yes. 
t1_dutjm97	0	*	Do you believe that the laws of other countries apply to more than just those nations and also apply to Americans?
t1_durzgft	0	*	Isn't that your desired result?

t1_durilya	0	*	You're the one without reading comprehension. 
t1_dtz7lon	0	*	Yeah some of them are more psychotic than schizophrenic, but the point stands.
t1_duifbol	0	*	I don't understand why we are arguing. We both clearly seem to agree that women have always worked. Why are wage disputes always blamed on working women then? 
t1_duiblm8	1	*	Ugly reactions from the underclass on the level of electing Trump I can see. But violent revolution? No way. For one, I don't think the problem is nearly as bad as you do. 
t1_duizjzr	1	*	Studying the Soviet Union and other dictatorships, I can safely that no, it's the same way everywhere there's large disparities in fortunes.
t1_dui30v2	1	*	Not even nano bots. Imagine what someone like musk could do in another country building kill drones for rich people. 
t1_dui69bb	0	*	mental gymnastics mate

t1_dui4gh4	0	*	No, I am the one who will say the last thing and be the biggest asshole! 
t1_duinqzp	0	*	Money in your pocket is worth less than money in the government's because they can afford to buy in bulk. We're better off with high tax rates and better social programs than the other way around.
t1_dukyu2m	0	*	Also, at 20 to 5, Im calling it a night. This hasnt really been constructive so I doubt Ill reply to you in the morning
t1_dukyo1a	0	*	All you got right was young uni student, which isnt hard to infer from my clear lean to remain...
t1_dttk3x3	0	*	You say the Israeli government does not control them? It remains occupied, and thus partially ruled by Israel.

t1_du6qz42	0	*	Omissions of fact impacting it enough to make the memo false. The FBI said the memo is false.
t1_duj7uu8	0	*	Tbh I don't know much about the politicians on your side of the pond, but if we include the option to replace bacon with tofu I think we might be good (tofu might even be more slippery)..
t1_dsezmo1	1	*	Some of those Trump lovers also say they dont like Goldman Sachs, but that must be cuz their poor and beggars. They just dont get it.

t1_dsfp3gd	1	*	>Every US president who served a full term led the country in war  But he did serve a full time though didn't he?
t1_dtufnry	0	*	Yes I read the article. Even using voice controls can be distracting. Texting is. Like I said, this isn't complicated, put down your damn phone when you're driving.
t1_ds3x42o	0	*	ROFLMAO... RTFA yourself. The first one answers your question; the second one can still be applied to living people.
t1_dup70fz	1	*	From Canada. We can ride horses on public streets probably not advisable in the city but it's a road users right to what they paid for.

t1_dttz606	0	*	I've no doubt they exist. But with the way things are now, they're closer to being their own independent party than anything else.

t1_dtu1x20	0	*	It does work like that in quite a few states.

t1_duj0h3j	0	*	Science is

t1_dues3zl	0	*	Citing is not the same thing as understanding. 
t1_duyfkwy	0	*	I've lived in multiple foreign countries including Communist ones, bud. There is free media in the US, but there is also propaganda. Not all propaganda comes from governments.
t1_duzgayw	1	*	Other countries? I don't think Canada, Mexico, Russia, China, and the rest of the would take too kindly to the United States nuking Los Angeles.
t1_duyn7lm	0	*	You mean your personal opinion is called disproving arguments?  lol
t1_duz0j4h	0	*	Not the same because I'm not fucking lobbying for big oil. The difference in impact and evilness is staggering.
t1_duz7p7h	0	*	Are you saying that me and Mr. Trump has the same impact on the environment? That's preposterous.   I spend electricity to live. Legislators are in a whole different ballpark.
t1_dv85x3i	0	*	So in other words, nothing but mass hysteria?
t1_du978mf	1	*	I will, thanks for the permission.
t1_dsabbft	0	*	So you care about immigrants alleged rape victims vs rape victims of Trump or Roy Moore?
t1_ds9pz6w	0	*	No, I'm not surprised that Germany is hostile toward free expression. As you noted, they have a long history of being hostile toward it.
t1_dtkp1r9	0	*	'Realize that what Hong Kong has now is more democratic than what Hong Kong has before the handover'...  Done talking to you. 
t1_dtjuv3s	1	*	In what sense?
t1_dtjlqd2	1	*	There are four lights!
t1_dsuesi6	1	*	Oh please... you know exactly what you did and can't admit that you were wrong.  Now you're all 'I'm so worried it's creepy he replied to me on my bullshit'    Get over it.  Gaslight more!

t1_dsootk3	0	*	Your totally right. Throw away your licence plate and don't pull over for no one. 
t1_dso2b1h	1	*	Well, I guess we'll see how it turns out in a few years

t1_dso429m	0	*	Well, communism is a failed concept. 
t1_dsqrqw6	1	*	Guess you never read Plato? He details that in his account of Atlantis.  Do none of you people read?
t1_dsoblda	0	*	I'm surprised you are talking to us peasants.   I mean, you make 10x more money than most families earn in an entire year.

t1_dteic1c	0	*	Try again.  
t1_dthfayx	0	*	I'm not the person you were taking with, and won't argue their position either way.  I asked you a different question.  Do you know the history of Haiti?
t1_du5bqo9	0	*	> That's not for us to decide though.  Why?
t1_du54wqd	0	*	Yeah if you ignore the part where the US installed their puppet, it looks like it didn't happen.  Funny how that works. 
t1_duyhfv9	0	*	Your username is hilarious!
t1_dv478kc	0	*	I generally agree, but I have the tender feeling that now would not be the best point in time to ask the average citizen anything about the EU because I have the fear we soon dont habe a EU anymore.
t1_dup7vqm	0	*	Your post history filled with mostly apologist responses to China related posts says otherwise. 
t1_ds6ipb8	0	*	Please, research more about benzos as i research about  translations.  Benzos are the most seller slipping drugs on the market.
t1_ds2zid0	0	*	Yes but it is clear you are not and that you are a malfunctioning troll. Ignore file. 
t1_ds9asap	0	*	Okay, we're done here.   When all is said and done, Trump et al are the ones going down.
t1_dte0jgt	0	*	No if you choose to only punish Jews for something everyone does thats like the definition of anti Semitic 
t1_dt3gd59	1	*	It's might not be morally correct but it's just the way things are. I doubt there's many major civilizations that came to be without violence and war.
t1_dt5afh2	0	*	Well, this argument is going nowhere unless you can pull up some evidence of a statistically significant number of false nationality claims.

t1_dtdaaoq	0	*	> It is wrong. [**But**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DE9pqmTWsAEMzpC.jpg) that doesn't equate Palestinian struggle to terrorism.  
t1_dt7hdok	0	*	Does the U.S. rely on a special book to establish that their citizens have a right to a country?
t1_dt3rj5r	1	*	Yeah, reading comprehension tests for someone like me who tends to very nearly flunk them for over ten years will do that to me. I hate those multiple choice ones. 
t1_ds6skhg	0	*	No, guy. The burden of proof is on you to support your claims.
t1_ds7ird5	0	*	Your first comment insinuated mainstream media is unambiguously unprofessional and only seeks to further an ideology. That's all me and this other guy were calling you out on.
t1_ds6ci1m	1	*	No that is fundamentally wrong, and you can say that both in public and online. There is literally a party, the afd, that has built a political platform around this.
t1_dsaoixo	0	*	lol I'm not a trump fanboy. I just think and evaluate things logically 
t1_dsiovzz	1	*	Yes, but a violent thug threatening innocent people with violence is neither.
t1_dsjeubl	0	*	I'm glad I don't have such a shitty outlook on life as you do. I just want more than one week off a year.

t1_dtzfzbq	0	*	Agree, it doesnt make sense but thats what you are arguing here..
t1_dtx20nb	1	*	The US agreed to it. Trump never agreed to creating NATO either but unless he leaves, he de-facto agrees to it as do every other president. Just as he agrees to NAFTA for the time being.
t1_dsxl1oe	0	*	LOL this is going to be fucking great.  I screenshotted this exchange so you can't delete your way around being summoned back to this thread.

t1_dud7juk	0	*	Burkina Faso, Catalonia, Cuba, Rojava
t1_dueadqa	1	*	No, we need to abolish private ownership of factories and stores, not abolish factories and stores. They would both work just fine owned and run by workers, democratically.
t1_dsd886k	1	*	That doesnt make any sense. And is nowhere close to a coherent argument
t1_dsce4ld	0	*	Good knowledge with nefarious intentions is better than no knowledge with intentions of gold.

t1_dscbctm	1	*	You think China or Russia will gain air superiority in American airspace? Not a fucking chance.
t1_dscf4fy	0	*	What does that have to do with stopping an invasion from Russia? They're going to sit idly by while Russia invades Finland because they're not actively looking to expand?
t1_dscx37w	1	*	Wouldn't it be more effective to send in mooses? I saw the gif of the moose clearing snow, they're terrifying!
t1_dscu5kc	0	*	Why downvote me? Do you have a source on the majority of his command advising against the bomb?
t1_dsc38ch	1	*	Thats not true at all. They might say that shit now but if shit hit the fan, there would be action. No one is going to sit around and let Mexico invade the US. Even if it is gotdamn California
t1_dsc8kfk	1	*	[Ahem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy)  The world would not sit by while Russia invades Finland. Ukraine? Maybe, but not Finland.
t1_dso3iss	1	*	And if they're really wrong, then I'm really right.

t1_dv62m23	1	*	Huh. Agree to disagree.

t1_dv4uaap	0	*	So you completely ignore my other fact? Also, perspective is subjective... Why does this trigger you though? 
t1_dv0wf61	1	*	Waxing poetic won't stop your points from being trash.

t1_dt7b3bm	1	*	Look, all I said was that English is a Germanic language that borrowed a lot of Romance vocabulary. The status of the two families as Indo-European is largely irrelevant to the discussion.

t1_dt50eq8	0	*	I told you I'm not going to debate you and scour the internet for studies.  your own studies don't even say free trade is bad they just say it's also good for mexico.  
t1_dv0vjww	0	*	Lol, bye.U0001f602
t1_dv1byhn	1	*	Thanks for the thoughtful and comprehensive response. 
t1_ds3dro3	0	*	There's only like 7 Republican seats available.  They might be able to take the house in spectacular fashion, but the best scenario is still below 60 Senate Seats.
t1_ds3dna3	1	*	All good m8 ;)  happy new year!
t1_ds5oc0z	0	*	President Freud?
t1_dsj8zza	0	*	> I would never believe a Palestinian over an Israeli.  I'm going to go ahead and quote this here, so you can't deny it when you realize what you said.
t1_duy5nar	0	*	Honestly i knew that, like a word on the tip of your tongue, i feel so dumb now because usually Im the one correcting peoples spellingU0001f602 feel free to roast
t1_duxvvvm	1	*	Yes?  
t1_dv1e8la	0	*	I usually hang around the mens rights crowd.  you would be surprised how many boys still get circumcised...
t1_duxr31g	1	*	Okay, it's clear you're being purposely obtuse lmao
t1_dtfle4p	1	*	Common sense isn't so common. Thanks for proving that.
t1_dtl064u	0	*	Yes, I know he was, but I was describing the *current* court. This isn't very difficult. People can have a position on that decision even if they weren't on SCOTUS at th etime. 
t1_dtfz0ol	1	*	> You can see  I probably can, but where should I look?
t1_dttrfwl	0	*	Also, the article you linked states that hunting is a cause of their extinction as well. Might try reading your source next time.
t1_duy7ur2	0	*	That's not an article, that's a tool you fool.  https://www.comparitech.com/privacy-security-tools/
t1_duy4fc5	0	*	you neither,goodnight troll
t1_duy2t1n	0	*	>Ok so that's just cultural traits.  Cultural traits are not negligible traits.   This also makes a mockery of the notion that Singapore is more British than anything else.
t1_e13bozj	0	*	Why are you so hostile?? You hate your own people?? I am just asking because I used to live in Canada. 
t1_dv0e5n3	0	*	Ehm I think you should maybe reread what you have said and then this comment with the definition. 
t1_dt7mjmb	1	*	Typfoutje van 5000km, ik denk dat je beter nooit de vlieger opstapt want je zou ergens verkeerd uitkomen... 
t1_duwf0ku	0	*	What about C18? they hated literally everyone who wasn't them too :) even people of the same culture and British :) 
t1_dsgojh9	0	*	So you are saying that you had no true political motive? And you chose someone like Trump rather than someone more like your admitted politics? Seems more like you are just kinda dumb. 
t1_duy02po	0	*	I love your enthusiasm. My take away is that 'climate change' is very easily influenced and not a big deal at all. 
t1_duxz5xw	0	*	No comment on the scare tactics? It's specifically relevant to the post. 
t1_ds17s97	0	*	He's legit i'm there with him
t1_ds26q0x	0	*	And all this at only 30km. By that point most warheads will either have, or be getting ready to, ditch their reentery vehicle and go terminal. Tactical nukes are some scary shit man.
t1_ds23aao	0	*	Ok. So how do private journalists?
t1_ds23azx	1	*	Ah yes forgot. Nice college? It's a state school lol 
t1_du41p2a	1	*	I disagree and consider it a poor analogy.    If this is making you upset and you consider it victim blaming, then you might want to re evaluate your emotional investment in this issue.
t1_du1t6vk	0	*	Nah, we can dismiss it. Easily. Keep trying if you want though. 
t1_dsu0tpk	0	*	None of that matters at all if your entire wallet balance can be wiped out through newly discovered vulnerabilities. 
t1_duzk64b	0	*	Vault 7 Wikileaks revealed the CIA uses stolen foreign malware to lay false blame for cyber crimes.  You don't know shit.
t1_duyghsc	0	*	You can close you're eyes and wish it away but the FBI is still going to be investigating Trump, not Obama or Hillary or whoever you blame for all your problems.
t1_duys20c	0	*	Yeah, that argument may get you accolades with your dimwitted friends but not here. Yes, party moniker means so much in a shithole like Washington.  The term 'RINO' exists for a reason, genius.
t1_dscunmx	1	*	> And US and allied forces become 5x more effective once done  I would love to see you quantify this. 
t1_dsqt270	1	*	He's not gonna let it go, even though taking a flight is infinitely smarter.
t1_dsrugep	0	*	'Lulz'  That's one way to make sure nobody takes you seriously. 
t1_ds3j2jj	0	*	You added that after they fucking responded to you... Because you're dishonest. Lying more won't change my opinion.
t1_dtob6c6	0	*	I'd rather no agenda pushing from all of them.  None have their house in order, so I don't believe they should be pushing their shit on other countries.
t1_dtoszxv	1	*	I don't, I think the EU probably would do the same things. But who knows? What we oboe right now is what the US is doing, a bit more concrete than yeah but you would do the same.
t1_dtolzxb	0	*	True, but even the most blockheaded brain can feel the difference created by different THC and CBD concentrations.
t1_dtoazo3	0	*	OK I'm sure the millions of people who have been killed by us installed governments or by us installed death squads really are glad their plight was made sneakily. 
t1_du8gkag	1	*	You know how plebs in my job receive their bonuses? Gift cards. Not even joking.
t1_dud3pzp	0	*	Dont pay your taxes, go to prison, its a simple concept, stop pretending that you dont understand that. 
t1_du85p4z	0	*	Oh i'm not quitting work lol i would be  stupid bastard to do that. I'm just quitting work. 
t1_dua1g74	0	*	Yeah that's an untenable situation, sounds like HR needs to put a teaspoon of cement in their coffee and harden the fuck up. I would've asked for that in writing from HR. 
t1_du87n5m	1	*	Pension funds were negotiated benefits that many companies bailed out because they spent the cash on other expenses instead.
t1_du85pv8	1	*	Ya Mum.
t1_du99oru	1	*	Thanks for the explanation.
t1_dtvzd9x	0	*	Lol the only threats are from you claiming to have any authority on this site.    Btw, have you ever actually spoken to a real life human being before?
t1_dv5ezew	1	*	War is coming.
t1_duhhem6	0	*	Like I said. It isn't competition.   They are subcontractors or alternative medicines with insurance companies eeking a living on getting people further up the NHS waiting list.
t1_dv2rlkn	0	*	The house of representatives had an artificial cap placed on it so now large states like California don't have the fair proportion of seats it deserves. 
t1_dv411ka	0	*	The economy is a lot more dynamic and fluid than you think. It's incompetent leadership, corruption and insecurity that is the biggest threat, not slow economic growth 
t1_dv2r6fc	0	*	The senate covers the governing by the states part.  The president is supposed to represent Americans, not states.  Therefore it should be people that put him/her in power, not the states.
t1_dv3bmuw	0	*	And i said that the electoral college is wrong.  Then you proceeded to tell me how 3 million votes is insignificant.  Then you use middle school taunts like I am supposed to be affected by it. Lol.
t1_dv2v2lg	0	*	I answered your question. It is not my job to coddle you just because you have a mental disability that makes it impossible for you to learn.
t1_dv2yven	0	*	>Are you suggesting that all other presidents before him simply used tricks to keep the deficit down? Let me guess, all Bushes fault Obama gets no blame?  Yes and objectively yes.
t1_dtut6jt	1	*	Don't look into it too much, because it sucks and is depressing.
t1_dtvwdps	0	*	I don't know that I'm the one being obtuse here.   You're using different words to say the same thing. 
t1_dsj3e2h	0	*	Go harbor some more terrorists 
t1_dtit2bf	0	*	Justifying your hate by nitpicking what a race is so you can think yourself not a racist is silly. It depends on how -you- define race.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)  
t1_dtjczsf	0	*	International law is a myth, it does not exist. The UN does not make laws.
t1_dtlb3jl	0	*	He repeatedly degenerates a whole group of people, that is racism. If he limited his hate to just hamas or the pa,  he would have an argument, as it stands it's just irrational vitriol.
t1_dthvafj	0	*	where you live it's normal for people to build schools without permits and not in accordance to construction codes?  would you send your child to a school that was built that way?
t1_dtkl3nn	0	*	If I start building something in a random place in my town without getting the proper permitting and such, it would get knocked down, too. Simple as that.
t1_duzahru	1	*	That is definitely not the only thing that matters
t1_duxq4h7	0	*	[Read up on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

t1_dt35zp2	0	*	Profound
t1_dt468do	1	*	Hold my cat, I goiwait...
t1_dt4qjai	0	*	Why can't evidence and faith exist in the same world? Why must faith be the feeling I have something is true?
t1_dsdsxch	0	*	I would say it changes the perception from people are probably looking at porn to people are DEFINITELY looking at porn. 
t1_dsbbr3s	0	*	So, targeted bigotry? I think that's still just bigotry.
t1_dtqm0zy	0	*	Sorry, I'm not trolling. I was trying to respond to you in kind. Next time I'll try to be more obvious.
t1_dsf8jpe	0	*	Look, real talk. You need to take a long hard look at yourself and whether you stand for the things you do because you believe in them, or because someone else told you that you did. Best of luck.
t1_du24req	0	*	no, they buy laws.
t1_dtodia2	1	*	Just because it's happening now and humans are around doesn't indicate causation, especially when it has happened before without humans.
t1_dv5p3e0	0	*	oh you. Dress as a Palestinian and walk around the West Bank.
t1_dv78ehe	0	*	80% of the former British Mandate of Palestine is Jordan.
t1_dv56xzc	1	*	I never said it was JUST a stun grenade. All I am saying is that there is a big fucking differance between the statements he threw a genade at a baby and he threw a stun grenade at a baby
t1_du52yvf	1	*	I didn't say don't put words in my mouth.  You're the one who's playing that argument.
t1_du50wvp	1	*	Well then you'll have to pay. You'll either have Facebook for free with ads or a subscription with none.

t1_dtbsig2	0	*	Nah I just like pointing out bullshit in other peoples posts.
t1_dtcjzr0	1	*	I agree with your position, least I could do. 
t1_dspa8ql	0	*	It's always cute to find a liberal who can't defend his position and then weasels out of it any way he can and still tries to play the uppity I am smarter than you card.
t1_dsn9651	0	*	So, you cant really point to anything specifically that substantiate your claim he botched the relief efforts..    Just pointless conjecture   Got it 
t1_dsn8v2r	0	*	That actually made me laugh out loud. Hes somehow the super villain and the bumbling secret agent that stops himself from actually doing anything.
t1_dso2f8z	0	*	We can if these trends continue which if I'm being honest I assume they will.

t1_dsndtxh	0	*	So, what has changed in the US policy that has negatively effected the world in regards to climate??
t1_dso6dm1	0	*	I'm sorry your liberal hate blinds you.
t1_du1mvfx	0	*	I think I understand, you weren't being an asshole, you were just offering constructive criticism? By calling her clothes salvation army scraps?
t1_dt9zcpr	0	*	So you're agreeing that you do indeed dislike Israel and you specifically want their civilians all dead, yes? Am I understanding you right?
t1_dsrv6r6	0	*	Cheers m8, honestly yes that is how I felt for the first year after, only now can I move on. It was a plague on this household. Please travel safe.

t1_dsbb4ro	0	*	If we were living in Uncle Britain's house together and he then decided to split it up between us, neither of us would have more of a right to the house than the other.
t1_dsai0u6	1	*	Says most of their neighbours today. Good luck with the time machine going back to the Ottoman times.
t1_dsahc0q	0	*	Idk what you're arguing here.  We have perfectly good hate speech laws. Specialized Jewish versions are unnecessary.  That's my opinion, controversial I know.
t1_dsdiq0p	0	*	damn, I didn't realize how much the phrase my dude would bother you. you must have an ashkenazi IQ
t1_dtnsgbs	0	*	Your opinion is that it's not a problem in the UK... I showed you how it is, you ignored it like a hypocrite. Now you're lying about having given your opinion.
t1_dtnp7x0	1	*	Cool. Reading the headlines of articles totes makes you an informed citizen.
t1_dtny0gm	0	*	Then by that logic feminist should be opposed to the hijab, which is prescribed only to Muslim women to limit and subjugate them. It is sexist and oppressive.

t1_dtj5dfm	0	*	I think you should talk to the families of the victims of those that were released by Obama. Its pretty easy to find them.  Reply after youve talked to them.  
t1_dtk5mj5	0	*	None of the above.  Plus, there is a restraint in its size & weight due to its location and its operating conditions.

t1_dtih82m	1	*	Wealthy people can afford to spend their time doing stuff for free.
t1_dtiyu5e	1	*	Conversely, you are assuming the evidence is bullshit without having seen it.   I trust a panel of three judges over your neck beard.
t1_dtiueuv	1	*	Of course they can.  And the US are within their rights to dispute it.  And that is pretty much in effect what happened.

t1_dtje7az	0	*	I thought the goal was to help them stop being homeless and be self sufficient. Getting them off the streets to do drugs and drink aren't (in my opinion) a good use of tax dollars.

t1_dtj1rnh	0	*	>one of the wealthiest cities in the world  The real issue is why the above has such a huge population of homeless people.

t1_dts3hc0	0	*	That's not N=1. That's the opposite. It's not like some Trump voters voted for an idiot but others didn't vote for one. They all voted for the same person. 100% of Trump voters voted for Trump.

t1_dspw166	0	*	Just wanted to see if you were a big enough person to admit you were wrong?  Looks like nope, still attacking me.
t1_duwvw31	0	*	We invented the SK government. Are you saying that if Russia just pays somebody somewhere to ask for them it's all good? 
t1_du3mlw1	0	*	What about that part, friend? Is it reason enough to randomly spew hatred towards Russia?
t1_du4f6cv	0	*	Okay so you're right there next to the whole thing. Will keep us updated If you can.

t1_dt5rpel	0	*	I am a black Southerner. Yes, most people in the Corridor of Shame are black. Why do you think that that is?
t1_ds2liyz	0	*	Got it, you ignore actual quotes and other evidence.  You provide no evidence to support your own claims.  Have a nice day.   
t1_ds2odtm	0	*	You're being naive about what partition entails.   Thanks for the chat, have a nice day. 
t1_dul578j	0	*	So you admit that all of the conditions you listed for being fascist aren't really exclusive to fascism, yet I am the one making irrelevant arguments? Okay...
t1_dt4ob2l	0	*	But that is our system. Like it or not. Representation. 
t1_dtagpd9	0	*	A) libel and slander are brothers  B) There was a cop in Minneapolis who sued the city mayor over texts accusing said officer of being racist. You can look it up yourself. Close enough for you?
t1_dta8icw	1	*	> Perhaps I'm being a being a little too idealistic here.  You are not. There is no hope for the future if we are unwilling to imagine a better one.

t1_dtalpeb	1	*	much better
t1_dtafz2j	0	*	Great.  So are you going to get back to the questions I asked now? Or are you going to continue to try and ignore them and hope we don't notice?

t1_dte0n3g	1	*	Thanks man!

t1_duay541	0	*	Thanks I guess
t1_duqk3bu	0	*	They attacked Hillary and made faux-white-nationalist groups that pretended to be Trump supporters (thereby making him seem like a racist). That's the explicit support you claim happened.
t1_duqmkmf	0	*	Yeah its not fair to people having a bad morning. He should have a bad morning too so that it makes the others feel comfortable.
t1_durfnf3	1	*	It's not the same when you can drive 50miles and still get said guns  It needs to be a Nationwide ban.

t1_duqk0bh	1	*	But that's exactly what McConnell did.
t1_duqbsx4	1	*	Its pretty hard to argue that arms is plural and plural means at least 2. Im not trying to say thats the law just what the minimum they could get away with and still be constitutional.

t1_duti0ie	0	*	Well, I might not have had enough time while powdering my nose to understand what is truly your point? What is your claim?
t1_dusymcp	1	*	Hahaha damn. 
t1_dut9hs8	1	*	So you're acknowledging that capitalism will be replaced in one more century?  What should it be replaced by?
t1_dur7j06	0	*	Ah yes, the Soviet union. The only socialist state that has ever existed. 
t1_dur6bba	1	*	How is that sarcasm?
t1_durszvq	0	*	I'm not? So not supporting imperialism is not thinking deep and childish? You don't think trolling is childish?
t1_durm3lz	0	*	Stop lying. There's no point. Surplus value is a real thing. 
t1_duqvrxs	0	*	 30 years of growth and your company has hired 15 people.  Go tour a BMW auto factory.
t1_durxvvl	1	*	Please explain to me why China had to set up walls to keep people from entering Hong Kong, and why there were people desperately trying to get in from mainland China? 
t1_duruh5i	0	*	That's Democracy and buying peoples votes.  As a small government enthusiast, I'm a big fan of government shutdowns. 
t1_dusjprj	0	*	 Stop, just stop. You are obviously desperate.

t1_dsp0941	0	*	Why is their GDP so low?
t1_dsp551k	1	*	Works for me, I was wrong. 
t1_due21rt	0	*	Bullshit. One is company breaking the law, the other is a company finding legal loophole to avoid taxation. Those are quite obviously very different things. 
t1_dsmc7as	0	*	I'm sure if they decide to blow up your lesbian gf you'll feel totes the same. 
t1_dskt664	0	*	> bigotry  There's those buzzwords again. Try thinking for yourself for a change.

t1_dskx60c	0	*	Jesus this is all you worldnews people have to come back with. Mishandling classified documents could be devastating, but no, it doesn't seem to matter to idiots like yourself. 
t1_dsl12sj	0	*	Wow you responded to the dumb shit I said and I have nothing to say back
t1_dskz5fn	0	*	thanks :)
t1_dsl3hzd	1	*	Of course they arent.
t1_dskuwqe	0	*	You completely missed the point. Congrats on adding nothing of value to the conversation.
t1_dsks1qd	0	*	You're right, keep attacking my credibility. Maybe that will distract enough from the fact that unvetted migrants can enter the UK on a regular basis. 
t1_dsltv1o	1	*	Of course they arent all terrorist-related.
t1_dskrrdu	1	*	Again, personal attacks. No rebuttal. 
t1_dskp773	1	*	Well we will just have to wait and see!
t1_dskt510	0	*	Yeah I know what that idiotic program was. Really dumb. Also not many guns in the big picture and has little to do with what we were talking about.  But I know it was just an attempt redirection
t1_dsktcpl	0	*	...Do you know understand what a figure of speech or a hyperbole is? Are you deliberatly misinterpreting my statements?  
t1_du7lxu6	0	*	Your feelings and opinions dont negate the fact that Trump has denounced them several times. Well before those events. 
t1_du7bibv	1	*	>could be  It could be, but it's not. Prohibition on guns has worked in other countries. Prohibition of drugs has not worked anywhere.
t1_du7lcev	0	*	Areas A and B are under the authority of the PNA, as of the Oslo accords. They are not Israel.
t1_du7o215	0	*	You really think this thread needs more strawmen for you to beat?
t1_du7dhnp	0	*	Nope. IDF tells their troops to kill Palestinians. Nothing in my argument changed. Nice tactic to accuse the person of this when proven wrong.
t1_dsdjw6w	0	*	You said it was on the news, and that it's reported. Are you backtracking?
t1_dsd8zrl	0	*	That's not the point. Ideology doesn't produce something. Labor is still a thing no matter the social organization. Labor produces.
t1_dscowc1	0	*	> the worst part is that you probably have the money, you'd probably would want the better, larger, faster, iphone.  Not sure what you mean by this?  Not hispanic, I'm from New Zealand.
t1_dsxunii	0	*	Well yes, because that's objectively not true. Most of America is incredibly beautiful and fertile land.
t1_duj6dq4	0	*	Very true. Is Germany still the same size as it was before the war?
t1_ds3o1iy	1	*	Wut? Without the USA, China wouldn't be an independent nation. The USA was the first nation to send arms to China to help fight the Chinese along with actually defeating Japan, thus freeing China.
t1_duzgize	1	*	Yes. 
t1_duz548u	0	*	Not paying to read that article. But OK, you can just remember how wrong you were when he doesn't go to jail. 
t1_duynx1g	0	*	It's not a run on. The only thing a little confusing are the pronouns, but those are easily understood using context clues. If anyone is being an idiot it's you. 
t1_duzte26	0	*	Letting the Russian influence sow discord between Americans is hurting the country.
t1_duz8qt9	1	*	I know it's pedantic.  But it's not an actual disease.
t1_duysay7	0	*	Haha, [ok](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/01/clinton-steele-dossier-opposition-research-244444).  Guys, there were middlemen involved, so that means there's no crime!  Hahahaha, poor leftists.
t1_dv0g4ed	0	*	I love how the article headline differs from what the actual quote they used said.

t1_duzgjfb	1	*	Fine, semantics. But if there is no such thing as unbiased, then this bot does as good a job as I would expect in the attempt. 
t1_dsrzwmk	0	*	Nope, I'm just not in the mood to argue with a fucking indoctrinated idiotic numbskull who apparently hasn't looked at any tech news since 2011. Have a good day, hope your bed is great. 
t1_du0hlv9	0	*	sure thing, broflake. whatever you rekon. nobody believes you or cares what your antisemitic dickhead opinion is. run along now.
t1_dub03rg	1	*	Israel doesn't control the Gaza-Egypt border. The government of Gaza doesn't have the destruction of Egypt as its main goal, so you'd expect the Egyptians to be more willing to help than Israel.
t1_duumpv6	1	*	If can not face valid criticism then I can understand why you would not like talking to me.
t1_duiah8j	1	*	Ok, whatever.
t1_dv5dpet	0	*	When has she lied?

t1_dtzltb0	0	*	That article talks about how the outcome of Brexit will be a universal negative gain you daft tit.
t1_dsg4ad9	1	*	There was no implication theyre linked. I just needed an exaggerated example of how being unsure about something doesnt imply a lack of bias. 
t1_dsfejkk	0	*	What do attack ads have to do with what were talking about?
t1_dsq9428	1	*	Agreed. 
t1_dsp4kbd	1	*	You have a very very low standard for victory.

t1_dssm6r1	0	*	A conventional first strike on all the hardened artillery positions threatening Seoul before the nukes were done would have been a good alternative to paying the blackmailer.
t1_dsrsz86	0	*	Balls in your court :)  At least you weren't a complete bitch and cried censureship. Also, If your SO needs a bull, holler at me alright?
t1_dsrtaq7	0	*	Well the future isnt history yet. Maybe Ill see America turn into the unironic shithole he was talking about. Hopefully not.   You have a great day.
t1_dss4dgr	1	*	Most people didn't think trump was better than hillary. Most people thought hillary was better, you know since she got more votes.
t1_dsrom0g	0	*	The queen held the responsibility, do you want to accidentally allow people to say some Soviet functionaries killed those people or guy at the top? 
t1_dstcluh	0	*	Nah, keep being stupid. You COULD just scroll up and figure it out.  
t1_dss6zre	0	*	Look. We're getting away from the point here. I'm not the one being critiqued. Trump is, because he is president. He has time and time again shown that he is unfit to be a president.
t1_dsmkzoc	0	*	That he made going to have?   I hope you dont homeschool him....

t1_dt0f07h	0	*	I'm saying that state violence is not inevitably justifiable. How is that difficult to understand? State terror exists.
t1_dum7kbr	0	*	Yep, Iran and Saudi power struggle is pretty much the reason for everything going on over there. Its too bad really.
t1_duljy2b	0	*	I consider thousands of people killed significant, we disagree.  But the issue was your omission of the event, I just wanted to correct the facts.
t1_dulseot	1	*	What else do you think could be a reason? If you had to guess. What else is the primary influencer in many middle easterns life?
t1_dumd3w8	0	*	Yes I am lumping together that entire region because it was one caliphate. Sure, you can also count the crusades. I'm just saying the west doesn't have a monopoly on imperialism. 
t1_duluwib	0	*	Yeah but we were talking about the Sino-Vietnamese war, which china lost.
t1_dum5gyj	0	*	Welp, there it is. The dumbest thing I've ever read. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about, and there are so many, many ways you are wrong I don't know where to begin.

t1_dun2fti	0	*	I never said they were better, they are parts of the US security complex. I was talking about the rest of the innocent countries on the receiving end of the domination.
t1_dslcg5e	1	*	I dont think you know what prejudice means, or youre just not following,  so Im just going to stop responding.  We have enough poor people in our country, in case you havent noticed. 
t1_dua885j	0	*	true.  All time low is too absolute of a way to put it, but crime is way lower than it was in the 80s and the 90s

t1_dugpazz	0	*	Pressing them on hard questions and they fall to pieces is fun though. It shows how pathetic the modern GOP is. They can't even admit their own party platform.  
t1_dugv5qi	0	*	I'm arguing the point, while you're missing mine
t1_dugo0vz	0	*	So now you're either an idiot or an ideologue. /thread 
t1_dugqg77	0	*	Page 31 it states that tradional marriage is the only thing we should have and children should only have a mom and dad. Do you know what the 14th amendment is? 
t1_duiba6m	1	*	Isn't it. 
t1_dugtfzk	1	*	Literally nobody would have been saying that besides Hillary (who doesn't have balls to say that after having already lost to Obama)
t1_dsf3r6b	1	*	Yes, you are misreading the subtext.   I never applied fault.   You wanted me to so you could claim a moral high ground which does not in reality exist for you. 
t1_dudv435	0	*	If you want chunks of butter and eat it, then sure, american cheese is terrific.
