t1_dtvehf9	0	*	Yes, every rich person is a monster and every poor person is a good upstanding citizen. I'm glad your black and white view makes life easy to understand.
t1_dtw2fyy	0	*	There's a whole discussion down thread. Give it a look.  
t1_dtvry33	1	*	We're omnivores.
t1_dtvhe27	0	*	Source?
t1_dtvcfsc	1	*	And im the kid?
t1_dtw836s	0	*	Yeah, only it's not even done for meat. It's done for *fun*.  YMMV, but personally I think that's even worse.
t1_dtvra0k	0	*	In parts of the world where land is not suitable for agriculture animals are heavily relied upon for food. So don't start with your vegan bullshit. 
t1_dtw44he	1	*	[Apply directly to the forehead!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_SwD7RveNE)
t1_dtvno6q	1	*	No one is telling you to grieve. No one can make you. Perhaps we can show some dignity and have at least a little respect for the dead.
t1_dtvo0v3	1	*	The thing is killed,so its leather being used is better than it not being used at all. A leather jacket is also less of a luxury than a mounted lion head 
t1_dtvkkut	0	*	I doubt he was planning on eating the lions afterwards.   Killing for meat is a whole different thing compared to doing it for the thrill.
t1_dtxi7pi	1	*	Don't twist my words. We've been the most dominant species on the planet for a lot longer than guns have been around.  
t1_dtvr8wh	1	*	well, at least now I know what it is that you think you're doing. 
t1_dtvn6yp	1	*	It says elephants in the original post that youre responding to. Its not copypasta when you quote yourself either. Do some research and come up with a better response. 
t1_dtvv6a0	1	*	Personally I wouldn't. I've always thought the people against dog eating were total hypocrites.  Though I feel there's easier sources of meat than endangered lions...
t1_dtvq11m	0	*	How so? There are even cultures where they say a prayer before sacrificing the animal. Don't come here with your idiotic vegan-wannabe-cool bullshit.
t1_dtvkjmu	1	*	I never disputed that, but Im also not going to pretend like they are heroes or that they are good people. 
t1_dtvcogf	1	*	You said usually
t1_dtw04po	0	*	Weirdly flavoursome for a bird that eats fish (what could be worse?)  Lots of cheap flights keep popping up from the east coast and the UK. Get involved! 
t1_dtve9fe	0	*	Lol no, money doesn't make you an absolute asshole like this guy. 
t1_ds1to2p	0	*	Interesting... I don't think I know many (or any) white girls (or woman, in your mother's case) who learn Asian martial arts. Kudos to her.
t1_ds3c51v	0	*	You were misusing the term millitary occupation. You don't want to debate because you have no argument, stop dragging this on.
t1_ds3vs6o	0	*	Trying to change the topic with ad hominem attacks?   I accept your surrender.
t1_dtbrt53	1	*	... place emoji here (smiley face with single tear).
t1_du5oz2i	0	*	So troll lol
t1_duxcilo	1	*	They could have had it printed on the bags, saving paper and still getting the word out.  A small sign near the cash register inside would accomplish the same thing for inside diners.
t1_duwvgjq	1	*	Yeah they cool, they cool.

t1_duqxn2y	0	*	You could say that there are far more Americans living in the country than there were in the 19th century, too, but it wouldn't mean anything. 
t1_dsl3wsc	0	*	Mexican people are still spending money on products that very likely come from American companies.   Its a global economy. 
t1_du67lpm	1	*	So...what should SK have done instead then?
t1_du71v9k	1	*	Don't you love the fact when these types of people are presented with real facts and logic that they resort to attacks of a personal sort...so entertaining 
t1_dsjfn87	0	*	What part did he get wrong and why?
t1_dsjuxr0	1	*	Even if it was you aren't packing the computer power needed to remotely do it into a consumer drone.
t1_dsjv2ls	0	*	So a missile?
t1_dunyoer	1	*	This sub has a very generous amount of fox news viewers.
t1_dunrmm5	1	*	That makes sense to me.
t1_dunom7e	0	*	Oops. Sorry ~~komrad~~ pal. You are right. Ban russia!
t1_dunre48	0	*	Ensuring(or attempting to ensure) Canada's position in the world doesn't ensure shit for it's citizens, just the upper echelons of the owning class.
t1_dunr4bv	1	*	That's just what it looks like to someone who isnt deep into politics. I'm out here asking questions so I can learn.   Would you agree that this shit can be confusing to the average person?
t1_dup95u4	1	*	I'll concede that. And the other part of the comment?
t1_dunmk9t	0	*	So you have no idea what you're talking about... Please never vote.
t1_dunner1	1	*	Holy Kremlin, good call Batman. 
t1_dunr46e	1	*	They definitely do.
t1_duo9i6r	1	*	I realize that.  I'm generally conscious of the fact that you can't trust the motives of random commenters on the internet.  I don't know why people downvoted your earlier post, it's weird.  
t1_dunoncc	1	*	Hate speech is free speech - SCOTUS.
t1_duq8eva	1	*	If that's the case, you're having a different conversation than I am. Have a nice day.
t1_duo1k7l	1	*	So what's your solution?  Become equal but opposite madmen?
t1_dungiuu	1	*	This still don't justifythe abandonement of human rights, if they are humans they have human rights
t1_dunzvoj	0	*	yeah why murder people in person when you can do it from your coach?
t1_dsgw3io	0	*	Which part op's comment or the article or the reality is suggesting China making a stop on reducing emission?
t1_dtt9krl	1	*	Actually only started using my acct a couple months ago. I did not know that, my bad. 
t1_dtwxjfs	1	*	You mean IF they hit. The only thing the anti-carrier missiles have ever hit are big concrete land targets in the Gobi desert. 
t1_dut6rfc	0	*	How is it moronic? Europe is just straight up bigger and contributes more to the u.n. I'm sorry if that makes you feel bad.
t1_dtlkefh	1	*	I'm gonna agree with you. It wasn't a joke lol the guy you first replied to was just wrong.
t1_du3v9f2	1	*	Because this was a protest in response to an entirely-racist attack on non-White people in Italy. Neonazis as usual are those using the race card first, against people.
t1_du2xhy6	1	*	So what is it to you? Why are you offended that someone is offended by sexist jokes? Have anymore Putin fun facts you want to share?
t1_dtli8yh	0	*	Whoops.  *Los Angeles
t1_duvttav	0	*	People like to throw the label 'racist' around today just because they disagree with another person's policies, not because there is any real racism involved.

t1_dtqchz4	0	*	Just a friendly reminder that as Americans you're no longer under the category of rational actor. In fact, I'm just as worried about the NK dotard pressing the button as I am the US dotard. 
t1_dttgxni	1	*	On 9, you don't have to, it's entirely optional. 
t1_dttcuix	1	*	Ah, I see you've been to all parts of Russia! Thanks for the review  And as a European, I'm glad people like you don't want to leave your country. Keep sending the nice ones, though!

t1_dttizmx	1	*	they also have 5 times the admin costs in private practice.  all those insurance coders and accountants aren't something a Canadian Dr has to have.
t1_dttd0ws	1	*	A shit ton of money is better than alot of money
t1_dttew0z	0	*	To be fair you don't have to pledge allegiance to the flag in school. It's just highly stigmatized to not do so, so it's all ok ^/s
t1_dttcq0e	0	*	Alright. Thanks! Guess I'll be off to check on a map where Portland is.
t1_dttewsg	0	*	Definitions of freedom say far more about the person making them than they do about what freedom is.  And buddy, you'd be better off not trying any further.
t1_dttcda0	1	*	It's not as much as wanting but we're born into it and this is our normal. It's also used for small talk once we're done talking about the weather.

t1_dttn1p0	1	*	It's much better if you have a tea for the queue.
t1_dttgb1g	1	*	America seems to have a far higher cost of living than the UK, I regularly see Americans on here moan about wages that would be very good exchange rate wise in the UK.
t1_dttb5lv	1	*	Socialism is a bad word in the US
t1_dtugbgx	0	*	no. does your fedora pinch your swollen head too tightly and that's why you're so angry all the time?
t1_dtv554i	0	*	You're the one that made the example - and it was shit.
t1_dtupgfy	1	*	which brings us back to underfunded in education, public service/park, and health services. 
t1_dttxgpv	1	*	I don't have $14,000 up front and I'm 23.
t1_dtuqc58	1	*	Id argue people forgoing  healthcare due to cost is more evil. I say this as someone who will have a bonus more than most families make in a year taxed at around 50%
t1_dttl8gk	0	*	Of the three, globalisation (while inevitable) is the only one that current policy can do anything about - I don't blame people for wanting to, say, gut the H-1B visa program. 
t1_dttl64k	0	*	sarcasm, my friend
t1_dtu5t6o	1	*	Are you really that stupid or is this just an act to make conservatives look bad?
t1_dttbc2x	0	*	How the hell do they come up with these numbers?
t1_dtvpkfl	1	*	In Norway it's free after you've spent 2300 NOK, or 206 British Pounds on healthcare in a year. You get a free card that lasts until December 31st.   Not 100% free, but I think it's ok.
t1_dtthv4y	1	*	You didnt seem like a dick at all no worries.   I dont really have anyone to talk to this stuff about so its nice that i've been able to moan a bit about it to someone.   Take care.
t1_dttqhez	0	*	I assumed you needed to borrow $200 for a checkup at a doctor's office. The way your comment was phrased made it seem like you considered this a low sum of money.
t1_dttgvoc	1	*	Obviously Australian minimum wage would be even better, but what I'm saying is that even the American one would be a great upgrade. I'd happily accept both :) 
t1_dttcudk	1	*	That's absolutely fucking mental.
t1_dttw8gk	0	*	Im not really sure how the royal family ties into this at all?
t1_dttuyn8	1	*	Currently you can also get a free card called an ehic that gives you free/token cost care across Europe too - prob loose this after brexit  
t1_dtv7caq	1	*	Yes corporation is another good comparison. Look at us! Making multiple comparisons. Aren't we smart.....
t1_dtz8n4y	0	*	Actually, I have 0 debt and take heat care of myself.  Haven't been sick for more than a day in a decade.  Nice try though.  Learn a viable skill and see where that gets you. Life changing. 
t1_dttk64f	0	*	Blimey, you could be right. Before my time though.
t1_dttgziq	1	*	Name calling.  Classic
t1_dttqkqo	1	*	Sad that it's PS4 exclusive though :S
t1_dup31kq	1	*	The recluse treatment would lead to a boredom-induced freakout, which isn't going to lead to good things. Some small town in the Midwest and no one would even notice him. He's just another white dude.

t1_dtdyuwi	1	*	He was populist but an obvious liar 
t1_dted12c	0	*	Not on the word of a stranger.  Give me something tangible and I'll look at it and come up with my own opinion.  Can't do that then what is there to consider?
t1_dte45yz	0	*	WTF? Words can be crime. I dare you to call the police and say you will be blowing up city hall. 
t1_dtdwwyy	0	*	And hispanics, dont forget the strong hispanic pro trump turnout.  Its because they believe that he will better their lives. Obviously their worldview is different to yours. Different, not wrong.
t1_dtdz0g0	1	*	Assuming we're not outbid or gerrymandered or squashed by rules designed to keep less-popular parties/candidates off the ballot or...
t1_dtdx6q4	1	*	Heil Hellmanns. 
t1_dte24c2	1	*	But if you instead offer that money at a police fund raiser and make sure they see it, then boom you're off with a warning
t1_dtdvama	1	*	Yes, like Obama. What's your point?
t1_dtefdfj	1	*	Well, what are the root causes of crime and corruption? We'll have to alter the foundations if anything has a hope of changing.
t1_dte3gzh	0	*	Oh yeah, killing our own citizens is bad, brown foreigners are a-okay. Andrew Jackson on the other hand, he's got some figures under his belt.

t1_dunlg4g	0	*	Ahh, one revolves around answering questions from the public, if you use notes that means you have no human empathy. 
t1_dt4r5wc	0	*	But it's my job as progressive to keep our nutjob in check. They don't run things on our side. The same is emphatically not true for the GOP, where the lunatics seemingly run the asylum. 
t1_dt51t3x	1	*	If you can't figure that out for yourself, you clearly have bigger problems to deal with.

t1_dsa09rx	0	*	Damn, Hitler must have really sucked at killing Jews if the population grew since then.  That's literally your argument.
t1_ds9xutb	0	*	Almost every developed democracy does not recognize Palestine as a state. North America, Western Europe, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand agree.

t1_dsaccn6	1	*	The users aren't all being divisive on purpose, they just followed along with the narrative they were given.  They're the tool being manipulated.
t1_ds9c5kq	0	*	You literally said,    >No one has done more wiping out than Israel itself.  Stand behind your own words.
t1_dsa115t	0	*	btw, we have destroyed another country since iraq

t1_dupx4e3	1	*	> the dude has an agenda  Yup. Justice for Palestine. Obviously.
t1_dsmyyhw	1	*	That's a good point, i'm so used to people associating diversity with nonwhite instead of what it is supposed to mean I made a mistake. I was wrong you were right.

t1_duy6sd8	1	*	pretty false statement. Japan encourage immigration from ASEAN and China. Less so from the West because their cultures are less compatible. 
t1_dsb58xj	1	*	Consequentially, I'd never eat brains. Not a fan of getting a prion disease.  I've eaten heart, liver, kidneys, intestines, but brains scare me.

t1_dseu72r	1	*	Thankfully the lowered corporate tax seems to be helping with that.
t1_dsegtrv	1	*	The problem of putting yourself into the shoes of another is that you immediately forget about everyone else that the circumstance affects.   This is a very unwise way to position ones self.
t1_dsdz2te	0	*	Some of them probably have their own place to live sure, should we just kick the ones out who are uaing government assistance?
t1_dsdxag7	1	*	Helping their economy when(if) it crashes hopefully wont burden us for another 20 years.
t1_dt6dz1p	1	*	Ahh. I see. That just was not very clear. Okay then. Carry on.

t1_dtze254	0	*	Please research the Israel - Arab conflicts

t1_duxzq5v	0	*	Thank you for making my day.
t1_dvdrzdm	0	*	The domestic stuff isnt the issue. I'm referring to a traitor who leaked Intel about foriegn governments to foriegn governments. He did more than blow a whistle. Fuck him he should hang.
t1_duybslc	0	*	So.. any kid today with a phone glued to their face?
t1_duyc40i	0	*	Interesting. So anything involving Putin is real, anything involving the Clintons is a conspiracy theory. And you think my point about Western propaganda is incorrect? LOL
t1_duxyu1x	1	*	I cant stand Putin, GWB or Trump equally. 
t1_dv0ngju	0	*	Why are you so fired up? Even if the theory was true, it's not like Coke would've done something wrong or illegal. Why are you so emotionally invested in a half serious conspiracy theory about soda?

t1_dsi6l8w	1	*	Yes they deserve higher wages, if there was not a huge supply of low skill labor. But instead we put skilled people in  huge line and let unskilled in freely.

t1_dsslczo	0	*	Selling military equipment is not helping to defend... I'm talking about boots on the ground. Also the Soviet Union supplied the Arabs, so the argument the US supplied Israel is not a valid one.

t1_dv4xvfy	1	*	Fossilized DNA expires after a million years, so dinosaurs would be way too far for us to be able to get enough genetic information to replicate them.
t1_dv42oep	1	*	pizza pizza
t1_dv48n60	1	*	Michael of Michael son of Michael. *snicker*
t1_dv475w0	0	*	Yeah, your solution DOES NOT WORK.  Sorry Charlie, if we continue with your solution, No more Rhinos after 2025.  2030 at the best.
t1_dv4iris	1	*	Its not racism, its fact. Asian demand has brought this species to the brink of extinction. Angry about that? Then do something about it. 
t1_dtf9j62	0	*	There is only a security flaw when used in certain ways.   There are ways to use those instructions which wouldn't comprise a security flaw.   
t1_du8mwaw	0	*	Much of the land Israel took was privately owned by Palestinians, as [evidenced here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine#Land_ownership).
t1_du8jkcm	1	*	Yeah, I did. That was indeed my point. 
t1_duom71u	0	*	Its not that they're going after a political party because their chosen candidate lost.   They're going after that political party because they're all breaking the law. 
t1_dunb4js	1	*	Rewriting history? What kind if weed do you smoke?
t1_dtq8on2	1	*	I loved Frank Sobotka :( and Omar's testimony 
t1_dtqagtt	0	*	Which realistically, has been a longstanding penchant throughout Canadian history (i.e. aboriginal people). As a Canadian, it's really quite upsetting.
t1_dtqj63k	0	*	Nice jab. Very subtle.    I wouldn't be criticising these assholes if I were like minded.
t1_duhv7l3	1	*	Your local PD.  Who just happens to be vastly, *vastly* outnumbered.
t1_dukv4ng	1	*	> But methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than co2.  It is also short lived, breaking down into other gases within a dozen years.
t1_dui339o	1	*	What you seem to be saying is when Government interferes in markets, eventually, bad thing happen.  I agree.
t1_duhnl20	1	*	Yeah, I can totally believe that.  Im moving to Scandinavia.  I just need to figure out how to be a refugee.  Edit: I live in Mississippi.  You have no fucking idea how bad it really is.
t1_duiscxe	0	*	Right. Im the problem here.
t1_duj4bda	1	*	Why do you respond as if the extent of the tax regime is income tax? Puerto Rico pays billions in US federal taxes every year.
t1_duhmclg	1	*	So... Million Ants?
t1_dui7z5o	1	*	He's also constipated. 
t1_dui12vm	0	*	Oh falling to the racist slant already?   a nazi behind everyone who disagrees with you.  Beat it kid. Adult conversations only.
t1_duhhyf6	1	*	thats alright I was just kidding 
t1_duhrfbg	1	*	Unless youre referring to Cuba, there isnt a single socialist state with better or comparable healthcare to the US. Europe is **capitalist.**
t1_duhqjk3	1	*	Inefficient for its cost. IIRC ~6x of EU countries per capita and still worse.
t1_duhlz73	0	*	>the most Nazi thing I've ever heard      it's too early for my eyes to be rolling so hard
t1_duho3v5	1	*	That's assuming the US would use all of its power to crush it's own civilian populace. Which it wouldn't. Heck alot of that army isn't going to follow orders and just shot their neighbors. 
t1_duhv2xp	0	*	Some people must dislike her or have stopped liking her, cause it's at 93 now
t1_duhnbj0	1	*	Yeah. It's messed up. But also regional, so you are likely to hear many vehemently different accounts. 
t1_ds6h8y5	1	*	Hoo boy, you really do love that flavor cognitive dissonance - keep praying to your Free Market God(TM) though
t1_dsnfi6w	0	*	Yes you did. You said might makes right. Time to show your might.
t1_dtcbz3f	1	*	It certainly didn't approve of it in Honk Kong.
t1_dtc848y	0	*	Yea.... someone is misinformed. Tibet was a part of China during the Yuan for about 100 years. 
t1_dtrq8hw	0	*	You did not watch the video? Did you not see high school kids and an educator declaring Polish Death Camps and blaming Polish nation. Ignorance. They have no clue, knowledge of history
t1_dto80ja	1	*	I just said huh?
t1_dtshc0h	0	*	I know. Palmolive is a soap. 
t1_dueq095	1	*	No thanks, although I appreciate your valuable input. 
t1_dsidqqd	0	*	Great, so let's just let Americans die in the streets because the free market decided that insuring cancer patients isn't profitable.
t1_dsixhix	1	*	Painfully due to scaling efficiency (and fuel mix on power grids being not 100% coal), this is still actually a significant improvement. 
t1_dsi3fl8	0	*	We could do it, easily. But weed is still illegal and nobody wants to put it down to help the government when they could work private sector and still smoke weed. 
t1_dshugl7	1	*	When do we smear poop on the walls?
t1_dshdc3s	1	*	Nope, not even that extreme. The kinds that are generally harmless but stupid rednecks that share conservative memes.
t1_dshgktq	1	*	Noted, thanks for the clarity! 
t1_du1bbmv	1	*	No, the data released doesn't give profile names. That would be massive breach of data protection laws.
t1_du2h3mz	0	*	He wasn't going to win. It was between Hillary, and Trump. Those were the only two candidates that had any shot at becoming president. Do you not understand that? 
t1_dv36jf0	0	*	Sanctions, they're pretty obvious that's why I didn't bother pointing them out to begin with. 
t1_dsrlm6b	1	*	Dangerous if you're an American of Persian descent because they'll think you're a spy.
t1_dtvzvfj	1	*	If you say so, pal! Have a nice day. :)
t1_dtxx2n5	0	*	Separate article I read was about food waste and loss of product.   I'm more concerned with the waste, especially the wasted money and how that money is being spent. 
t1_duqbtdh	0	*	Agreed, but our failure to eliminate poverty shouldn't prevent us from criticizing governments that imprison human rights lawyers, ban free speech, ect.
t1_dtf68w8	0	*	He said listen to and believe them, not listen to.  Reading obviously isn't your strong suite, so I understand your confusion.
t1_dsf9229	0	*	Hey buddy,   They did.   Yours sincerly  The world 
t1_dsgo4cq	1	*	Have you ever watched a sci fi film. Putting the AI in charge of military functions seems like a generally bad idea...
t1_dszy36k	0	*	> That's why you have gun control to change the culture.  That isn't how things work. Take a sociology class. They actually go over this topic in the intro classes.
t1_dszv1xf	1	*	Yeah, now publishers will be scared as hell to even touch that book.
t1_dt0hns5	1	*	> were always wiser than you   I for one would not call knowing more information being wiser. Being more experienced would be a better way to put it. 
t1_dt066ci	1	*	You really think nicely of Russians ;) 
t1_dt08fng	1	*	I dont think they know about communism outside the black book of communism. Being intellectually dishonest is the base state of being for most anti-communists i see online.
t1_dsztxkv	0	*	I'm talking about a lot of things.  With out using names I have no idea what you are talking about.  Or whom, more specifically 
t1_dt0518i	1	*	You can fly from Toronto to any destination in Canada and most of the ones in the US in under 6 hours though.

t1_dt03qam	1	*	I need my car stolen like that please !!
t1_dt05phl	0	*	Is that the highway where hitchhikers go missing. Mostly aboriginals I think... they even put signs up for public awareness..

t1_dto4tz5	1	*	Nice try, hologram.
t1_dto1a5w	1	*	We're all holograms. Great philosorapter Plato tried to tell us with his allegory of the cave!
t1_duqg3gg	1	*	Depends on the sect.  I was always told that good people, regardless of their faith, went to heaven.  The faith itself was treated as more of an earthly philosophy then it was a ticket to paradise.
t1_dupqjvq	1	*	im bad with sarcasm, sorry :)
t1_dupyxp6	1	*	Exactly. I'm figuring there's barely anyone who actually has the capacity to just be truly happy.
t1_dt117ik	0	*	Stop wasting my time you are just trying to mislead people. I hope you are at least getting paid and are just that dumb.
t1_dt0a9qk	0	*	Do you want to post a screen shot of that? Because I just checked that and didn't see any.
t1_dt0a8th	1	*	Street cameras?  IN ENGLAND?!
t1_dt5v2je	1	*	Too much water is bad for you. Does that mean water should be banned?
t1_dt44cvi	1	*	A people get a government they deserve
t1_dt4tl9q	1	*	Yeah I think we don't see it as often with weed permeating into surfaces simply because people can't afford (to smoke) that much ganja.
t1_dt5a765	0	*	It smells like shit though, especially to non smokers
t1_dt57fhs	0	*	So you seem to go with Only homeowners should be able to smoke pot. Not even sure really what to say to that.
t1_dte014l	0	*	If you protest, and others counter protest, you are not being opressed and targeted.

t1_dsaiz50	1	*	lmao so fucking random
t1_dut3waj	0	*	As I explained and as you did not refute, the wall does solve the problem.  So it really is just a cult thing with you huh? Trump Leader says it so say we all kind of a deal.  Sad.

t1_ds96k7k	0	*	It's that just like... Literally whole beans floating in a cup of water?
t1_ds8zdrc	1	*	It is a factor but isn't the primary driving force of worker productivity, even if it was we aren't supposed to live in a feudal state where the ruling class take all the fruits of our labour.
t1_ds8gssm	1	*	Only use a simple filter coffee machine, you can do one cup at the time, you can even set a timer to start the coffee at the same time each morning, so it's ready when you leave.
t1_ds8pfjo	1	*	The coffee is designed to take cream and sugar, so yeah it's not that good. 
t1_ds8c2ms	0	*	Empirically, minimum wage increases don't result in significant layoffs.

t1_dtd8w3m	1	*	I'm curious as to why?
t1_dtdmyhj	1	*	Yes it's because Palin is stupid and bush 2  toned down his intellect. 
t1_dtd23o1	1	*	No way, man. I don't want anything that awful in my body.
t1_dtd29to	1	*	Thanks for the offer but I'm going to let this one pass. Eating that much ^corporate saturated fat^cats, can't be healthy.
t1_dtd2hmx	0	*	Yeah, its a wierd train of thought to have.  I feel like i make no impact so im going to make sure i have absolutely no impact 
t1_dtd7nni	1	*	Agreed. And I truly believe he wasn't ever planning to win. 
t1_dtd1fzh	1	*	Dumbp
t1_dtd271f	0	*	Did classical republicans vote for Trump?
t1_dtd0gs4	1	*	I feel dissatisfied when I engage with them because I either get a nonsensical rebuttal or no response.  It's borderline trolling. 
t1_dtd2hx4	1	*	Or because of lobbying dollars. See the post above.

t1_dt9qzi6	1	*	I love taco's and I hate sausage. I say more taco's!
t1_dt9o9z4	1	*	Ironic considering the article we're commenting under.

t1_dui94mi	1	*	Just goes to show how nothing is black and white, especially Economics. Actions and reactions have wide reaching effects that are hard to foresee, and there is no easy answer. 
t1_dui7ovb	0	*	... I really don't see anything wrong with his statement. Over the long term, traders add value to successful businesses and accelerate the demise of unsuccessful ones.
t1_duim16p	0	*	So? The 1% still owns 40%. That's still highly disproportional, and it means that that redistribution was minimal.   
t1_dui90uu	1	*	no, there's a difference between tax avoidance (which includes legal tax writeoffs) and tax evasion, which involves criminal fraud.
t1_duig1yp	0	*	Reasons = Because employers compete for workers

t1_duihcs2	1	*	Too bad if people like Bill gates can't become obscenely rich, they won't create innovating business and those floor cleaners rot on the street starving at the state run store out of food. 
t1_duia8sk	0	*	It would probably depend on the degree to which capital gains taxes were raised
t1_duiaa6y	0	*	I live a super frugal life in a middle wage job and I'd like to leave hundreds of thousands to my kids. Not really stepping on anyone but not putting back in what I'm earning.

t1_duzid36	1	*	Um, there is already a high speed line that goes between DC and Boston.  What exactly are you proposing?
t1_duzl3gy	1	*	No you are right. The next World Cup is in Russia.
t1_duze156	1	*	I don't disagree. I think the US should invest in its infrastructure.
t1_dsl505p	1	*	You are right, they lied about it before but even if they are lying about it now 824 is so ridiculously high it must be an error in data.

t1_du8fw8y	0	*	So they have not done anything. 
t1_dtv47hy	1	*	I feel like this guy has a fetish for eating terrible food on camera... it is fun to watch though.
t1_dtet194	1	*	Hydroponics, combined with an infrastructure system that reintegrates food waste and human waste into back into the agriculture somehow?   Could be feasible on a mass scale once we figure fusion out.
t1_dteucxy	1	*	But also voters need to be better informed, and why are environmental issues not higher up the list of importance?
t1_dtf9u2p	1	*	I doubt these people will appreciate you poisoning their food so they become infertile.
t1_dteq7kv	1	*	Self induced climate change seems to be a good candidate 
t1_dtf70od	1	*	Yes.   Obviously there are confounding variables, and that's one of the main reasons to do an in situ experiment. 
t1_dtesw83	1	*	That would never happen. By the time we get to the last animal everyone would be vegan because that meat would be worth billions. Same with wood. Costs would prevent it in theory
t1_duci633	1	*	:z
t1_dud8oy8	0	*	That's because they tend to eat healthier food. Compare meat eaters that eat healthy to vegetarians and it looks a lot less favorable.
t1_dshstwz	0	*	This will disappoint you terribly but you are in fact not the victim of neonazi downvote squads, lol. You're not a victim, my deranged friend. No matter how badly you wish you were.
t1_dshxeky	0	*	You can attempt to insult me, but you've yet to demonstrate any meat to your bullshit claims.
t1_dshbak1	0	*	The one I posted was.  And it doesn't even begin to answer the question of what China would do when we start nuclear strikes on what is effectively their back yard.
t1_dsf4wsv	1	*	I agree they should have legit vegetarian meals since kids should learn how to prepare healthy alternatives.  But pissing off religious people is ok with me.
t1_dsf8rrm	0	*	I find it funny that you took the time to type that.
t1_dsfsi95	1	*	That bizarre pink color does not say edible to me.
t1_dsfyw70	1	*	I think maybe if you draw picures and use simple words  some of the idiots will *slowly* begin to understand why you are correct.
t1_dsfyqty	0	*	I never argued about that. You clearly lied in your first comment, though, to make it sound much more nefarious.
t1_dtct8v2	1	*	Oh hell yeah. Of course I saw that. And then there's also the spider silk where they fed the spiders carbon nanotubes and the result could hold up a human's weight.

t1_dt0tzta	1	*	Russia develops vaporware constantly that they never build, but put on paper. 
t1_dt1sabu	1	*	Yes. And it made it more easily digestible but less coherent I feel.
t1_du8tdc3	1	*	Yes, the war needs to go on for another 15 years to end up with another dictator or a terrorist group in power. No more debate allowed, this is what needs to happen.

t1_dsqxd4g	0	*	...how?
t1_du36hws	1	*	That's entirely different group. 28 (out of 47 IIRC) were completely cleared. Life bans for other 9 or 11 were changed to short terms.  They all were denied from participation by IOC.

t1_ds8vtv2	1	*	Uh, no, we're trying to fight AGAINST the definition that social services provided by the government is socialism.
t1_ds6dd2u	0	*	So do you support the concept of collective punishment? Making a family homeless because one of their kids was killed attacking an Israeli. How does that rub you......
t1_dscqbxp	0	*	The reality is that people like you is what keeps the Middle East a mess
t1_dtqs0ra	0	*	Do you still touch your genitals?
t1_dso0a8p	1	*	I'm not, I'm pointing out the hypocracy of those who think he's out to destroy America suddenly trusting his opinion on Korea.
t1_dsdg6ie	1	*	I quoted the source as it came to me, no place to doubt, no lies. You still did not reply to the question of potato born. What do you really want?

t1_duwmtpt	1	*	If you dont like the same story, turn the page.
t1_duxb4rq	1	*	So the real problem isn't the weather or the planet, it's that you failed to succeed in life. Pretty much sums it up for 70%of people complaining here. 
t1_duwzrzq	1	*	I didn't imply that the stats were bad. You did. Certainly the burden of proof is not on me. You often use faulty logic in this way?
t1_dup2fuj	1	*	Dude, I'm thumberstrock by you having 0 karma and tons of comments.  You sir are graumatated!
t1_dup426f	0	*	I know you're probably joking, but freebasing is just smoking coke. Crack has a bunch of other stuff in it to crystallize it to make it easier to smoke. 
t1_dup300p	0	*	Well, gravity and evolution are theories.
t1_dup83b6	1	*	Thanks for your honesty, I struggle with opiates too just not heroin so wasn't sure. Stay strong, bro

t1_dsuc5v3	1	*	It is waaay thinner then octopus. It's more the texture of a tough tuna.
t1_dsuvv5f	0	*	nomikai = drinking party, generally has a food course included.  bounenkai = end of the year party  shinnenkai = new years party  both the bounenkai and shinnenkai are nomikais.
t1_dtp2tn3	0	*	Those missiles also aren't designed to even hit the jet, they're generally proximity based. They blow up in the air close to the target and pepper it with shrapnel etc.
t1_dtp1197	1	*	Because in a total war situation civilians are part of the war machine. Civilians targets were also often bombarded by leaflets leading up to an attack warning people to evacuate.
t1_dtp1yu6	1	*	Same thing isn't it? **/s**
t1_dtpfq3i	1	*	...figuratively speaking, of course.
t1_dtoyxtw	0	*	Hell, I keep forgetting what time AM/PM in general is. 24h system just feels so much more natural and practical (no doubt due to me growing up with that, of course)
t1_dtpva6n	0	*	Its equivalent to telling squirrels its illegal to jay walk.  Your concept of laws is of no consequence to them.
t1_dtp34zj	1	*	These are internal military after-action reports used for military planning purposes.
t1_dtorl95	0	*	Of course it is :) 
t1_dtppy85	1	*	They were earlier in the conflict.   Not this specific group but one of the groups the disbanded and sold their gear in the area.
t1_dtpb8ui	1	*	And then easily breaks during the stress of thin air combined when something exploding close by...:P
t1_dtopkwb	0	*	And you're deleting your comments because you lack self-esteem or confidence in your opinion?
t1_dtqde06	1	*	Thanks for the enlightenment!
t1_dsg1bft	1	*	They do, they are just better at hiding it
t1_dujn1r6	1	*	No, just getting forgetful in my old age :)
t1_dsecjst	1	*	Even shitposts may worth a karma!
t1_dshuazq	1	*	i don't mean to be rude but calling it a pyramid scheme displays an alarming lack of knowledge, this isn't how pyramid schemes work at all
t1_dsdnnse	1	*	> Did you really just argue that bubbles can't be found everywhere  No, I did not.
t1_dshuzh3	0	*	i don't mean to be rude but calling it a pyramid scheme displays an alarming lack of knowledge, this isn't how pyramid schemes work at all
t1_dtn95uv	0	*	I don't claim to have invented the argument, but if you work for a wage, then yes. There's no significant difference between renting and owning a person. I'm surprised you haven't heard of this.
t1_dtmocs2	1	*	Nuclear reprocessing doesn't (yet) make economical sense, though, and is thus not the norm as far as I know. Moreover, it still leaves you with the problem where to store the remaining waste.
t1_dtmlnp8	0	*	 France is one of the most influencial countries in the EU.
t1_dtmy2rq	0	*	lol yeah I already read it. There's nothing in there. Good luck on your next big disappointment.
t1_dtmjpxa	1	*	I think you're illustrating why this site SHOULD be considered a good source for news: the discussion in the comments, which add context and opinions beyond what you'll find anywhere else.
t1_dtselwn	1	*	LOL. What ignorant drivel. 
t1_dtmi87l	1	*	Draw a wardrobe in MS Paint, and then walk through it
t1_dtmnbot	1	*	I only really care about what the earth cares about, so no. 
t1_dtn1uvf	0	*	Japan was already in the process of conquering Asia when the US sanctioned them.  They most certainly would have grabbed Indonesia. 
t1_dtmla5a	1	*	you basically ignored me and said la la la la la... well done. 
t1_dtmov54	1	*	Yes but the latest published numbers haven't shown the increases yet. Just the lows from 2014-2015. 
t1_dtmnb0o	0	*	European vehicles pollute more. Diesel is far worse than gasoline. 
t1_dtmj2s4	1	*	You should tell this to the mainstream media. 
t1_dtmxeje	0	*	You're entitled to your opinion but your opinion is not supported by the projections
t1_dtmh25c	1	*	> I can't wait for US to destabalize into propaganda rioting fuelled by your leader (Putin) and his puppet (Trump)  The delusion is strong with this one
t1_dtuqnvl	0	*	> You're not an expert on either one.  And I suppose you are?    Please, educate me, wise one. 
t1_dsgt67m	0	*	There are some free, safe societies, but they are the exception, not the rule. And eventually they are overtaken by a more aggressive one.
t1_dsfhtqx	1	*	Dude, i think you know how Ixb4d answer and what my arguments woud be so I just let that stand here. Wexb4re in a dead end
t1_dsfjfs1	1	*	Wasnt never again about the war, not the holocaust?

t1_dt1u8jf	0	*	Here he is^
t1_dux1jvd	0	*	And dont realize germans hate their asses
t1_dspkx12	0	*	I dislike people telling others, as in teaching them that their feels are the correct path to truth.  Like, you know, teachers and shit.  Also, you're the one who called them stupid, not me.
t1_ds1k0a8	0	*	Literally everyone involved is dead, but still people use that coup as somewhat relevant argument to justify Iran's regime actions...
t1_dskbc6m	1	*	Very well said... Hard to argue with someone that drinks tea with their pinkie in the air!!
t1_dv35nuu	1	*	If you know then you are simply a Russian who was througly prepared for his job..
t1_dtf0980	1	*	There are very few things I agree with Trump on, but his stance on NATO, is one I do agree with. 
t1_dted9sm	0	*	This is your brain on turkish nationalism.    Go back to your Islamist safe space.
t1_dubib5s	1	*	They gotta earn that $4.15/hr somehow!
t1_dubbqzk	0	*	Yeah, he's poor, yet he's talking to people halfway across the world on a very expensive device that people in Africa would NEVER be able to afford even if they saved up their entire life. 
t1_ds2cvut	1	*	Worse? How can it be worse?
t1_ds22l9o	0	*	What is SCP?
t1_dtn1zxf	1	*	I think I'd ask Dave to drive the truck over myself, thank you very much.
t1_dto6cq1	0	*	60% Christian but about 5% actually practise it. I'm a Catholic on paper and in census but I say my prayers to Gabe Newell before bed.
t1_dt54so5	0	*	Why are you rattling on about terror? It has nothing to do with the nuclear deal. The only dishonesty here is from the US
t1_dtz97dm	0	*	These reports that you haven't linked to?
t1_du14w7h	0	*	Not sure what you mean by keep. This is the first time I've responded to one of your comments.   Not sure why you would bring up medical facilities. I referred to military installations.   
t1_dur9r10	0	*	I love how you blanket statement banning everything as if it will fix violence and play it off as facts.  
t1_duozj3t	1	*	I think you're both retards.
t1_dsu61q0	0	*	So to clarify, you think meat eaters think it is ethically wrong to not eat meat. Ive never heard that before and honestly have a hard time believing it. 
t1_dsv473r	1	*	This is not true.
t1_dstxdr0	0	*	Do you think he was referring to microbes, or just using anything as a shorthand for sentient animal life? I don't think we have any ultra-radical Jainists on this sub.
t1_dut0v7c	0	*	That's not much better
t1_dusmjrg	0	*	Yes.   Can you provide a compelling  moral argument that one group is more deserving than another?
t1_dustykk	0	*	Yes mate. Get behind that fucking wall where we don't have to look at your ugly mugs ever again and take that senile cheesy puff with you.
t1_dusky9d	1	*	Ignore him, just a self-loathing mexican and the_donald supporter.  There's crazy people everywhere.
t1_dusvgmg	1	*	Whoa now.  The war on drugs gave us a large portion of our prison slave labor.  Hardly worthless.
t1_dusz0ir	1	*	I made my own uniform from a Solitude Guard's surcoat. I became an Imperial reflection of the Stormcloaks.
t1_duu5i6j	1	*	The people that own the corporation have the religious belief, is how. That's why only non-public companies are allowed to use religion as a reason to deny specific benefits.
t1_dusjg75	1	*	Probably a good idea, yeah.  hacking has never once been a discussion in my elections because you can't hack a pencil and paper.  That's just one of so many things broken with USA democracy.
t1_dut31ih	1	*	Fair enough :)
t1_dusjazo	0	*	What? I thought Blue Lives Mattered! Cops cant ever be wrong!
t1_duue54d	0	*	I had this all the time in 2004. My girlfriend was a yank now living in London and constantly getting shit for GW whenever people heard the accent.  We met each other working for John Kerry. 
t1_dusqrw5	1	*	I'm excited for Bart and Ralph's band to play before they head to the White House to be advisors. Lol.
t1_dusqb57	1	*	You stop that.
t1_duvawi2	0	*	I wonder what you think of job applications, where they ask for race/ethnicity. In any case if all you have left is adhominem you're more or less wasting your time.
t1_dut9c1s	0	*	The leaking of Hilary' s emails just before the election is what fucked her, and Russia was behind that.
t1_dusw6av	1	*	I would say current Trump supporters are dumber than Trump voters.  Unfortunately that's around 40% according to most polls :'\
t1_dusjzse	1	*	That's why you need to take Vancomycin IV so you can get [Red Man Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin#Red_man_syndrome).
t1_duskvaj	0	*	you are inept
t1_duvsxso	1	*	Ok? You still haven't answered my question.
t1_duskwfc	1	*	Exactly. I still have a coworker whos mocked me for being gay, trans and autistic. Im none of the above but holy shit. Everyone thought it was funny while he called me slurs. 
t1_duts8xr	1	*	So any source you'd have would be from infowars? 
t1_dusk3ke	1	*	Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up. Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up.
t1_dusl53w	0	*	Bush was brimming with class and decorum compared to Trump. 
t1_dustsby	0	*	If ur a us citizen hanging out with terrorists, that is high treason & you are no longer a citizen.  Either way fuck that dude, glad he's dead by drone strike.
t1_dusjdtc	1	*	But not as divine as Ricky Martin.
t1_duuv2rz	1	*	you say that horse was pulling that cart but didn't you see that ant also pulling? 
t1_dut9m3f	1	*	You disagree with the statement that securing the border and then allowing well qualified admittees into the country is a good idea?  God, some people are just fucking dumb
t1_dtogpw2	0	*	Quit talking to yourself 
t1_dtqhja7	1	*	Am not pro gun, but it is not simple at all. Even suggesting limitations on firearms would be political suicide. Firearms hobbyists are very powerful.
t1_dull15e	0	*	Work in hospital as a tech, and my wife is an RN.  We've both seen a lot of shit at this point, both literally and figuratively. 
t1_dulawuv	0	*	TLDR - I assume from your long post that you prefer that retard as president.
t1_dulb3bb	0	*	I'm not an expert but I would have thought that double bagging would work.
t1_dul52js	1	*	If he can only afford 72 degrees he's clearly one of the poors.
t1_dul69fw	0	*	The major difference being the propaganda machine in the Philippines is on Duterte's side, whereas in the US the propaganda machine is almost wholly against Trump.
t1_dunjqq7	1	*	HMJB   >In this case, *an* attempt to say something *even* more offensive than what *Frump* said.   FTFY
t1_dul6e1d	0	*	Or maybe dont judge people for one throwaway comment on the internet. Either way works.

t1_dulaxre	1	*	I farted
t1_dukydq5	0	*	Read more closely on autism. And be more sensitive to the disabilities of others. Being autistic isn't like being an asshole. One thing you can't help, and the other, you excell at. 
t1_dv2thyx	1	*	Textbooks tribalism
t1_dv2zcpk	1	*	wtf did I just read lol, everything you just said is what hamas does not idf.
t1_dv3ezn0	0	*	Due to your question being too open ended and as I pointed out, utterly irrelevant.  When was the last time Israel sent troops to places that weren't there's and the troops weren't wanted? Today.
t1_dskgupu	0	*	People defending Hitlers honor while being objectively wrong. Seems extreme to me. 
t1_dv1h4ut	0	*	No amount of R&D would make it cost effective. We need a fundamentally different way of traveling through space.
t1_dv173a1	0	*	aw, thanks
t1_dv113sc	1	*	I know.  A can contain B within it, without *being* B.  B can be a multitude of things which are not A, while remaining a subset within A.  So...yeah, so?
t1_dv1ebej	0	*	You're highly confused.
t1_dtaiuoz	0	*	The only thing it will inspire is that dude's own ego.
t1_dt9x0ik	1	*	Yeah, but to be honest I have a feeling that area of Ireland might be uhh... You know, solely populated by sheep and leprechauns :')
t1_dtfhbwt	0	*	True, but despite all this vitriol and people calling for blood, he manages to show support for the victim. And my point is that people aren't focusing on that as much as they are supposed to. 
t1_du38531	0	*	Because a transgender female with low testosterone still has advantages over actual women even if she has low testosterone. How many times do I have to explain this to you?
t1_du5xet9	0	*	Oh, so you didn't prepare a response? Neat. 
t1_du90p38	1	*	Latin America? Florida saw the biggest boom in its real estate market in 2009 after the financial crisis from Canadian investors. Dozens of neighbourhoods are owned and lived in by Canadians. 
t1_du9emuh	1	*	New Zealand. Yawn. Using China as an example doesn't suddenly mean they're the only ones.
t1_du9t2sc	1	*	ub864
t1_du93d0b	1	*	Even with enforcement, being mostly criminally funded money wise, are the buyers really going to care? No, not really. They know they can still drive up prices and eventually make their money back. 
t1_dtuncdg	0	*	Fuck the European Union
t1_dtuenqf	0	*	In all those articles there is one plaque in one church that came down. That is exactly like removing monuments to trators....
t1_dtvcuyx	1	*	Considering that half of the country was divided between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, it's hard to call them based in Poland.
t1_dtup8zq	0	*	so you havent been to poland, you dont have family that went through it, and you're still talking?
t1_dtw265f	1	*	This. Vaped for a couple years. Stopped in a week easily, much easier than it would be for me to stop drinking coffee.
t1_dtuc7wb	1	*	Of course he's arguing semantics, he was never not arguing semantics.
t1_dst9psw	1	*	lol
t1_dua2hv3	1	*	Staking is the act of creating blocks which contain verified transactions, this secures the network. Rather than using POW which is destructive to the environment this is energy efficient.
t1_duu4pcn	0	*	Are you saying Fox News is satire?
t1_dutnejv	1	*	>Finding a way to kill someone without doing it yourself won't make you any less evil in my book.  And it doesn't make the dead guy any less dead either. If Putin ordered it he's responsible.
t1_dt89ynb	1	*	>artificially-looking yellow, sweet stuff you Americans call mustard.  Hi yeah, you're kinda dumb  At least read the label before you call something artificially colored or sweet lmfao
t1_dt7lnof	0	*	Hmm need to find this

t1_dtb3ghj	0	*	Thats foolish 
t1_dtaumg9	0	*	Actually, it's an article about Trump sucking. It's an article about a shitty President.
t1_dtar667	0	*	My point is that there would be no such story about Obama. He didn't cry about fake news and poor treatment from media on a daily basis.
t1_dtauoeq	0	*	You repeat yourself like that will make you correct. No wonder you love Trump so much. 
t1_dtgu0wi	0	*	They found the vials had been tampered with. That's the evidence that supports the various testimonies from inside. It's proof. It's not speculation. 
t1_dtgo909	1	*	lol, clearly manner is something not taught where you grew up
t1_dteqvpx	1	*	they both work, but one is far, far easier
t1_dt8wycf	0	*	Talking out of your ass, and wishing curses on strangers for disagreeing, sounds like you could have used a little discipline yourself. 
t1_dt84vgy	1	*	You're thinking of Star Trek phasers. 
t1_dt8fahc	0	*	What's the masochist/sadist ratio? Kinda interpreted more masochist.
t1_dtzakfm	0	*	Thats some strong apologism.
t1_du06smv	1	*	So they're literally out there with weapons and shields in numbers and they don't kill? Those aren't nazis then. Do you think 1940's Nazis thought about the legal game?
t1_dtz4rte	1	*	One of them wore a nazi medal, and the other one has been recruiting for people to join them.
t1_dtyyfoe	0	*	Yeah, how tragic, people can't lie about genocides happening. Next thing we know, they'll be thriving as a country like Germany too. 
t1_duwwmlq	0	*	It != she

t1_dtwq4bs	0	*	Holy shit can you please go around to the various political subs and offer lessons on how to develop this attitude?  Id gild you if I had any money.

t1_dtwlbmp	1	*	Ya those would be the ones I was thinking of. 
t1_due3hcx	1	*	It's just really hard to tell because his three responses were three different ways of saying, we don't know yet, but I bet we will!
t1_dsqke6j	0	*	Maybe you should even...
t1_dsqwdxp	0	*	That's like saying Charles Manson and killing people have nothing to do with each other.
t1_dsr4qay	0	*	so then look through the thread a bit more closely cause there are plenty of such comments...
t1_dsqxx7p	1	*	Prosecutors should never have to consider their political career when choosing whether to do their job properly. That is so fucked up.

t1_dtj86m3	1	*	My mum is your mum BRO! *shakes fist*

t1_dsh0csv	1	*	But the globalists are the good guys 
t1_dsgmlcr	0	*	He did not pardon Manning, that is false. He commuted her sentence. Pretty big difference.
t1_dsg8cls	1	*	Hmm. Ok, I can see your point in that. If the Dems can't get their act together to put someone decent against the Reps, then they are going to lose.
t1_dsgj05h	0	*	If you think the US is a capitalist society youre mistaken. Switzzerland would be a better example.

t1_dsgps8c	1	*	What?  What did I say you disagree with? 
t1_dsgpj9r	0	*	Yeah I also think a good regulatory organ is needed for the system to function correctly, I kinda misunderstood your viewpoint and thought you were saying that free markets simply don't work.
t1_dsgfqva	0	*	So, eventually you're so big that the additional savings of growing even larger are outweighed by the costs of growing larger... it that it?
t1_dsgl60d	0	*	Right, but so many people foaming at the mouth over this gladly took it in with Obama as president. Wake up America you are being played (if you aren't rich)
t1_dsgrpmg	1	*	Or women....
t1_dsig2uz	0	*	I guess I wasn't clear. I mean: are there *examples* of government being significantly worse?
t1_dsgeu9i	1	*	Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes. You'd be better of hiding them from white people, statistically.

t1_dum7old	1	*	it was just an example of the hypocrisy exhibited by those in power. 
t1_dt1ofj3	0	*	Unfortunately unless we get a not for profit healthcare industry I don't think our system will become a single payer system. It's too driven by profit.

t1_dtn0e18	0	*	The dossier was the only thing that could get them the warrant, thats not cherry on top, thats the whole cake.
t1_dtn6boe	0	*	Well, without the reference, it's meaningless.  The fact that they're saying it on T_D makes it even more suspect, since that sub is as biased as biased can be.
t1_dt8qg0z	0	*	>  I just stated that I think US intelligence goofed.   They did and no one denies that. It's just that you're in no position to give them shit about it just because you're Dutch.

t1_dsfhudh	1	*	A better way to put it: look at what happened to every nation that put away their nukes and then annoyed the US. 
t1_dsfkiu5	0	*	Failing would mean failing to intimidate your target. Nixon failed in the sense that North Vietnam didnt fold when confronted by those tactics.
t1_dsfpclh	1	*	Yes- but no.
t1_dsfa3fr	1	*	True. It would be interesting to see what true isolation would cause. I suspect it would lead to a civil war, but I'm definitely not an expert by any means.

t1_dt30m5o	0	*	why not do what OP asks and record his words?  if anything it'll exonerate him.  
t1_dt3bbce	1	*	That's just dumb. How did flailing his arms imitate a reporter who's arm is paralysed in the shape of a chicken wing?
t1_dt3r9a3	1	*	Holy sheet. Get this guy out of office, quick! If he ever has to deal with a real crisis (like Cuba crisis), we're doomed! Please, do it for us, the other parts of the world.
t1_dt39abx	1	*	If that's what it is, then it's fine. 
t1_dt3c9ul	1	*	Seeing as he said himself he was Kenyan, or the fact that he had a foreign student I.D. Or that the birth certificate was clearly a forgery. But yeah other than that, hes totally an American citizen.
t1_dt307o9	0	*	The same guy who claimed Trump is 6'3 and conveniently the *exact* weight to not be obese?  Yeah, I'm not buying that for a nanosecond.

t1_dtnf3i6	1	*	I dont think so but I guess well see eventually 
t1_dsbuvb4	1	*	What about flying a plane with no cockpit? Asumed your screwed because i googled that e and e thingy and looks like a server rack with no way of backup flight.
t1_dsxcnqd	0	*	That article literally doesn't say anything different than what I did, the headline is just convoluted to make the reader believe that Steele/FUSION GPS was paid directly by the DNC.
t1_dtjw5p7	0	*	Thanks! I don't know why but it never struck me to check that. Im definitely putting it on my list and going to try to make it out
t1_dsih5gb	0	*	That's a paddlin
t1_dsi54p4	1	*	im a guy though, and its random thoughts nothing serious 
t1_dshzuib	0	*	No, not in political neutrality, in the validity of the documents leaked. I would love to see what they held back on the RNC, but it changes Jack diddly shit about what we found out about the DNC.
t1_dshwwon	1	*	Huh. TIL about the paradox of tolerance and homophily.
t1_dshqe36	1	*	Since the law hasn't changed yes it is. There is nothing preventing something like that from happening again. 
t1_dsdbpo5	1	*	Further proving my point. Thanks more!

t1_dv215sq	0	*	You are arguing with yourself, you're citing citations to me, that prove your previous citations are false.
t1_duktrpb	1	*	The NYT used the average poll data of the Huffington Post polling database for the 2016 elections, not polls carried out by themselves, as far as I can find except if youre able to prove me wrong.

t1_du23v05	0	*	Grow up. Trump says he has no plans to reverse gay marriage and has praised the LGBT community. Just because you want something to happen so you can say told you so doesnt mean he will 
t1_du7ds5l	1	*	What does the overall decrease of violence as history has progressed have to do with current US practices that involve human rights violations?
t1_du24j7y	1	*	Antifa hasn't killed a SINGLE person. Can't say the same for the crazy ass Trump supporters
t1_du2a1hf	0	*	If a homosexual doesn't want to be homosexual, then they should have a right to seek treatment, yes? 
t1_du3w2sj	0	*	Most christians are evangelical,  baptist, or catholic. None of them subscribe to the old testiment in the manner that was portrayed. 
t1_du1sqgm	0	*	I grew up in Nebraska, so I guess I should state my bona fides before making these statements.
t1_du1qs7o	0	*	> How fucking stupid are you?  Look in a mirror, joker. Look in a mirror.
t1_du1txv6	1	*	Oh ok 
t1_du1ns7g	0	*	Exactly, but I didn't show up to make specific claims. I'm just ceasing their ability to make baseless claims with exactly zero knowledge.
t1_du1qof6	1	*	He did free the hostages, though. Theres no way to say thats a lie and its far from propaganda.
t1_du1vz2g	1	*	So whatever they follow now is the doctrine of Christianity.  Checks out, it's the same thing they've followed for the last millenia.
t1_du1tn19	0	*	This was deliberate because the founders didn't want the cities running roughshod over the rural areas.  But then you have California where that's exactly what's happening.
t1_du3as9e	0	*	Umm, yes? The world doesn't care, at most some Americans care. That was my point. 
t1_du1rkez	1	*	Gary IN has a fairly notable status as the worst or one of the worst cities in the USA. It shows up often on reddit threads about worst cities.

t1_du39p92	1	*	Theres no way to know really , is there? besides, the word gets tossed around so carelessly it doesnt really mean anything anyway.
t1_du1pf0k	1	*	Just like the word Niger has been reclaimed by the black community. Are you really trying to make that argument right now
t1_du1ulhp	0	*	I never said I supported it. But who knows, there may be people who do want to change, shouldn't that be their choice? Shouldn't they be supported if this is how they really feel? 
t1_dsbt5tv	1	*	Oh and furthermore - you now owe me your evidence, burden of proof is on you pal.
t1_dsbs30p	1	*	Not to mention he buys Ribena... Ribena is pure sugar Diabetes-fuel, and he's worried about aspartame. Kek.
t1_ds3z365	1	*	Not in the least bit.  All economic systems must come to grip with limited resources.
t1_dv5oqkl	1	*	Then what's your point in relation to the article and op's and my comments? Relevance?

t1_du7jc5k	0	*	Lol you mean if someone rigs the election it doesnt matter who does it unless it's Russian ... Quite an unbiased perspective you seem to have ...
t1_du7epan	0	*	Maybe because we don't live in an ideal world and the whole thing is politicized? Or are you forgetting what happened to Chelsea Manning? Should he take that risk?
t1_du86urq	0	*	What a convenient out. Any info that won't fit his narrative just gets labeled as can't be verified and doesn't get released.  
t1_du7tfe0	0	*	Dude, what? Look at [their page](https://wikileaks.org/-Leaks-.html). Its literally all dumps.

t1_dty78ev	1	*	Hmm I didn't know that.   Still though.
t1_dutbhzi	0	*	Still, these statistics doesn't show what people actually read. And it doesn't show that VG only has 5% of total readers. As far as I can tell, correct me if I'm wrong.

t1_dtd5cj0	1	*	They are after all, called The Individual States of America ;-) 
t1_dtcf78f	1	*	>The police openly kidnap and rape little boys, something the Taliban doesn't ***openly*** condone  FIFY
t1_dtbwct6	1	*	Hitler, Che, pol pot, Chavez, Louis CK, Mao, Stalin
t1_dtbzwsi	0	*	No, I never said that. What I said is that you cannot interchange Americans and Nazis in a problem without substantially changing its moral underpinnings.
t1_dtci33b	1	*	Okay? That doesnt detract from how fast it blew up on reddit.
t1_dtbzs81	1	*	In a round about way they just sided with the taliban and declared them the rightful inhabitants of Afghanistan, the double think is strong.
t1_dtc8pza	1	*	It was in mine, up till year three (secondary) when it became an optional. 
t1_dtbzy3o	0	*	Did you take a survey or something?
t1_dtbxshl	0	*	That makes sense. I also love your username because I generally am the same way hahaha. The problem is that I hate myself for being cynical because I absolutely loathe cynicism. 
t1_dtbxw0g	1	*	Truly reprehensible. I don't defend any religion. 
t1_dtc0i0w	0	*	To be fair, you did engage with your initial responses to him.  
t1_dtda0ll	0	*	I would imagine not, since it's made up.
t1_dtc096z	1	*	It's just a comment, dude. 
t1_dtby1r7	0	*	Unrelated, but I like your username. 
t1_dtc50c8	1	*	Thank you. 
t1_dtd6zs8	0	*	Reported 
t1_dtcely0	1	*	Each sentence contains all the words listed at the bottom of the comment.
t1_dtbts70	0	*	Why would you blame someone else for me cutting my hand off? No one is making them do this. They are choosing to do this. 
t1_dtca3c4	1	*	Sharks literally cannot be outside of the ocean.  People who support ISIS can be outside the Middle East, and whatever that probability is, it is not zero. 
t1_dtbx709	0	*	It's sensationlist BS.  One was a bb gun and no one got injured. Multiple were suicides in parking lots after hours. A few negligent discharges.
t1_duew0jl	0	*	Ive always wanted to go see your country and surrounding countries and areas... these soups are really bringing that want to a whole new light!
t1_duf1wah	1	*	More like both.
t1_dufart0	1	*	maybe i should just type a novel right now and you'll make it all book-publishing-ready!
t1_duew527	1	*	They would have my sympathies if I wasn't seriously dating one. Instead they have my contempt. My doting, loving contempt. 
t1_dueyvl3	0	*	Wait... I was always told it was the Welsh that fancied sheep...
t1_dueusj9	0	*	Supper is meant to be later than dinner I believe. Think it was quite an old fashioned thing. I learnt it from LotRs.
t1_duf2hn5	1	*	Its a love *beat*  And a love beat  Is a good vibration.
t1_dtoz04j	1	*	That's a weak comeback.
t1_dtddayc	0	*	But for the low low price of 2 nuclear warheads, you can show him that you actually were serious this whole time. 
t1_dswdbq4	1	*	Science isnt a emotional, feeling entity so technically it doesnt give a shit about any of my opinions, nor yours. :)
t1_dtmax6w	0	*	Its bad because it chose who could have a voice. A monster got put in charge with no way to remove him and europe burned. You enjoy your conspiracy theories.  
t1_dtm2btr	1	*	That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for your time and perspective. 
t1_dtmpq0n	1	*	Wrong.
t1_dtnd1sl	0	*	Cute
t1_dtz2htc	0	*	You need help. I hope you get it for everyone's sake and for the sake of any loved ones you may have in your life. 
t1_dtz2703	0	*	Oh, in that case my mistake! Facebook almost always releases monthly active users as its main statistic because the numbers look better, so I assumed that was also the case here! 
t1_dtzfgb3	1	*	You should not be so naive. 
t1_dtywugw	1	*	I think you replied to the wrong person.
t1_dtz18eq	0	*	I'm mid 20s been off facebook afew years. From what I see the only people still using it are older gens and people who have friends long distances away and both mainly use it for meme and messages.
t1_dtzfu3u	1	*	That's a very interesting insight, I'll have a better look at what cronyism is 
t1_dtz9fta	0	*	>True patriot love in all of us command   RED ALERT RED ALERT   CULTURAL MARXISM INBOUND
t1_dtyvcu1	1	*	Shush! We don't talk about the weaponized Canucks since Pamela Anderson!
t1_dtyyvv2	0	*	Nope, not next. That's us 17 year old kids. We're mature enough to drink bleach. None of that tide pods weak shit m
t1_du0s79y	0	*	Congrats on the false assumption, for I am a Canadian dealing with his shit ;).  I'm simply applying your own logic. Don't like it? Take some time to reflect.
t1_dtz0rzt	0	*	The fact that you have to qualify it makes it distinctly *not* an inalienable basic human right
t1_dtzb2u7	0	*	True. If I want customisation I still get an iPhone and jailbreak it.  All the reasons to not want an iPhone usually are good reasons to get one. Unless you just wanna get away from Apple.
t1_dtzf31x	0	*	So obviously you haven't typed your emails in.
t1_dtzi9ef	1	*	I'm still going to say it the proper way anyways.
t1_dtz3pwf	0	*	You already admitted it was just made up garbage, remember? 
t1_dtzx82n	1	*	No, I'm saying that what we in America see mostly is not advertising, but manipulation and lies. Calling it advertising makes it seem okay, when it's anything but.
t1_dtzqt0a	0	*	I watched the tape before the controversy broke. I chuckled. No one says peoplekind, so its pretty obvious he was exaggerating for effect. He even used a mock serious tone.
t1_dtz2a7t	1	*	I thought they got rid of defaults.  I'd also like to point out that we're on r/worldnews, which has an even more ridiculous and obvious ideological slant than r/politics.
t1_dtzdvy6	1	*	I dont mind personality at all, using an actual word epuld be nice. 
t1_du09c07	0	*	Wrong, wrong, and wrong. But again, what would I expect from a fascist that hates free speech? Nice job.
t1_dtz7n33	1	*	> dislike for Trudeau for no reason  
t1_dtyw3f5	1	*	It's a pretty big factor. Manifest destiny. Thanks to our British benefactors and other global factors we did pretty okay at fighting it off. Turned out a bit better off than Mexico at least.  
t1_dtzeiz8	0	*	Just pointing out what he said. 
t1_dtzey3n	1	*	Have you not read Into the Wild or seen the movie? I recommend you watch the movie at the least. 
t1_dtyxoy8	0	*	Some of that is shit tbh...  From a fellow Canadian, who just applied to work at one of those safe injection sites. 
t1_du0an8g	0	*	And you're a liar. If it happened at all you're leaving out details. 
t1_duabpvd	0	*	Oh so you are saying all of the millionaire black people in this country (tens of thousands of them) are somehow being oppressed as well, huh?
t1_duqrood	0	*	Blame that one on US business.  They felt it was a competitive advantage to make things in non-metric sizes reducing the volume advantages Asia had.  
t1_duqmcri	1	*	Hey you can't comment twice in the chain! That's grounds for impeachment.
t1_duqsp8h	1	*	At least you found a way to feel better than me
t1_duqsgi4	0	*	East was killed by a falling house. West melted in a suspicious attack but the assailant fled the country in a hot air balloon 
t1_durbmsj	1	*	I learned how to do my homework on the bus.  XD
t1_duqsbad	1	*	Relevant username.
t1_duqccdd	1	*	Yes, at least since 2005. His other lobbying for foreign government efforts go back to the 80s. 
t1_dur46j0	1	*	Then what's the Dem plan? Put forward such unpalatable candidates that even demented old bigots can get elected as the alternative?  
t1_dutjeqj	1	*	Indeed, generally Russians however.
t1_duqlcug	0	*	Well, I still think Kennedy was the modern pinnacle of Democrat Presidents. It's been sliding downwards since.
t1_dur13d7	1	*	This person efficiently collects angry radiation
t1_dus0wkw	1	*	Ohhh, we called that a capstone project here (after I'd graduated, hahaha!!!); that makes more sense.
t1_duqcrpq	1	*	All good it let me have a punchline :p
t1_duqqab2	0	*	You catch Charlizes Wee Brain?
t1_duqr2tg	1	*	Get with the times, man...  Rhoomba'd.
t1_duqby2w	1	*	Not the correct application of that term.  Points for citing a textbook argument theory even if it doesnt apply. Although, wouldnt you be a strawoman?  
t1_duqqtu6	1	*	that didnt stop j edna hoover from persecuting MLK  -mallory archer
t1_duqxvhd	1	*	Was probably hard to get the good stuff in Guyana.
t1_duquv6l	1	*	*Trump rolls a 3d8 for Pardon*
t1_duqlv91	1	*	Assuming there is an impeachment case before he resigns.
t1_duqks3w	1	*	So that's why I'm missing the Dubbya years. Thought it was just from the lead in Michigan's water.
t1_dspaz5a	0	*	I'm Asian dude. 
t1_dsoe4y1	0	*	You're funny. Thanks for the laugh.
t1_dtiwv9r	1	*	Sure. Update us when a British court actually indicts someone over watching kinky porn
t1_dtj34a3	0	*	> I cant imagine why someone would lose a job over watching porn if its on personal time.  Don't read or get out much then, do we?
t1_dtxh89t	0	*	Defending any culture that fines a man $100,000 and sends him to prison for sending an email that did little more than hurt someone's feelings is wrong. Do better.
t1_duuxdbq	1	*	Didnt answer the question. 
t1_dtoh8rz	0	*	And if you asked these people who they voted for, the majority would did vote would probably say Trump. Who, unironically, produces pretty much every POS product that his line sells in China.
t1_dtofb1j	0	*	We are not having a legal discussion here . You understood the point I have made previously. 
t1_dtokl6b	1	*	The real reason they lost the war is they got in trouble for not properly licensing their photos.
t1_dtolkbw	0	*	That would be pretty tough to do. The North had endless amounts of european immigrants streaming in, and had no reservations about throwing them into the meat grinder.
t1_dtonm5o	1	*	and to think, which side constantly bleats on about snowflakes  u guys can't even handle stern comments on the internet lest u lurch to the opposite side of the political spectrum lmao
t1_dtoorfs	1	*	Well yea, like 3 years...
t1_dtooq9e	0	*	At work we say and Bob's your cross-dressing nurse. That cpuld very well be site specific though
t1_dtof0gp	0	*	Basically, you can say you'll do anything as long as you don't actually do any of it.
t1_dtokux1	1	*	Because we, at least in Switzerland, had a shitton of criminals from Nigeria immigrate.
t1_dtouck4	0	*	It's Virginia pride in particular. Also, calm down and use your inside voice. 
t1_dtoot82	1	*	okay man 
t1_dtok5tr	1	*	Dont worry at all. I have family in Perugia, and Im sure my Italian is much worse than your minor English mistakes. 
t1_dton7bn	0	*	Parole was something usually exchanged between officers. Enlisted would only be so lucky.
t1_dtp3ny2	1	*	I'll definitely be checking his stuff out.
t1_dtom8aa	0	*	Ahahahaha sxec, media inglese fa schifo!
t1_dtowkyd	0	*	the alt-right basically made it a standard talking point to accuse the left of being fascist or totalitarian - clear case of projection/NLP strategy 
t1_dtooz3f	0	*	Salzburg. Not surprising, I suppose, given that it was literally a theocracy ruled by a Prince-Archbishop until 1803. 
t1_dtolsdu	1	*	Quoted for truth is a similar, more contemporary expression.
t1_dtonui1	0	*	Agreed
t1_dtonmxe	1	*	Roasted harder than Georgia when Sherman came through.
t1_dtovbdr	0	*	As it should be.
t1_dtohc8n	1	*	probably because 14-30 year old migrants are the ones coming to germany.
t1_dtozd06	1	*	They're nominally Catholic like everyone else, but too lefty to be very religious. They're pro-choice, for example. 
t1_dtor33b	0	*	No the killer was already arrested. 
t1_dtos64c	1	*	U0001f631U0001f631U0001f631U0001f631U0001f631
t1_dtp0bs6	0	*	I hope you got warranty on it, and can exchange it for a working one, BRO. Seems to be malfunctioning.  
t1_dttp2t0	0	*	That's exactly the idea.  
t1_dtotj9u	1	*	> it's that they were treated as non-Whites.  This is asserted, but no evidence is provided. I wonder why this is? (It's because it's not true)
t1_du512yl	1	*	Colourful opinion, from my point of view. Duly noted.
t1_dt6t52z	0	*	Try and find a retailer with a better price during peak
t1_dt4infa	0	*	Sorry but comparing coding to life-risking professions like medicine and building bridges is dumb.
t1_dtd7pe8	0	*	lol. youre the one who made claims about somalia, citing sources is your job
t1_dt86xyf	0	*	Do you know what a straw man argument is?
t1_dt2h91k	1	*	Talking to someone is not collusion. Talking to someone and making an agreement on stuff against a political opponent is.  But hey, continue to compare pears and apples.
t1_dtyj1fh	0	*	Youll notice we bluster all the time but are still to afraid to actually invade NK.  And you know why?  China.   Please keep putting your foot in your mouth. 
t1_dtu9x33	1	*	Maybe he just doesn't want to be afraid of each and every drink he takes
t1_dtw6eju	0	*	When did I say that?
t1_dtupudn	0	*	Yup. Beyond a shadow of a doubt. 
t1_duo86fp	1	*	That's the spirit!! Save yourself!! You can do it! YOU DON'T NEED OUR HELP! IT WAS ALWAYS WITHIN YOU
t1_dsdcbo6	0	*	Let me remind you about what you said:  >You mean we can shoot hospitals.   Can you please provide a link of me saying that? Or you can apologize. You know, whichever is easier.
t1_dsd7yp6	0	*	No.
t1_dtid801	1	*	statistically any number can be near zero
t1_dskuc6b	0	*	Cause matters. It's weird you think it doesn't.
t1_ds1a97b	0	*	Germany took way more migrants than eastern EU members like poland and hungary. Even Bulgaria did more to enforce their border than Germany since Merkel just decided to not bother.
t1_dsvd5yy	1	*	but real women...
t1_dv2hq7o	1	*	I think it is mostly left leaners not listening *on reddit*. In general then it is certainly a large crime of everybody
t1_dv2kcnj	1	*	It appears they are using the proper designation, which a lot of people do not.   Depending on population size, only one of those words will ever be technically correct. 
t1_dv38nji	1	*	Should have gone for black lives also matter. Inclusive, targeted and I'm sure the acronym could have been used pretty effectively since a lot of the protests involved police shootings.
t1_dv2ihda	1	*	It's their job. So of course they do it. Just like any other boring desk job. 
t1_dv30qg4	0	*	Then, I apologize. 
t1_dv3f8l7	1	*	Make sure to tell all couples that didn't have kids that they aren't allowed to be married any more once they hit menopause then.
t1_dv2sd7y	1	*	Arrest and prosecute like what happened to Blagojevich. Hire great US Attorneys and federal employees.
t1_dv2nk2k	0	*	Your second sentence is why it is absurd.
t1_dv38m7i	1	*	Should have gone for black lives also matter. Inclusive, targeted and I'm sure the acronym could have been used pretty effectively since a lot of the protests involved police shootings.
t1_dv2evy1	0	*	Unless you're voting for double stuff mint.  No, it's not a thin mint.  I don't care how much you pretend it's a thin mint.  Who the hell has ever bought a mint Oreo twice?
t1_dv3r3z6	0	*	I'm willing to throw about $10k at any credible lawsuit to re-open (or abolish the requirement for) the machine gun registry.  I want me a P90.
t1_dv2g6r2	1	*	They get paid to do it though
t1_dv2gw6s	0	*	Yeah instead of 3%  we only spend 2,5%.  You really think we would go into bankruptcy?  lol
t1_du4kz23	0	*	How/when did we screw them over? I know we've meddled around in South America, but what happened with Venezuela in particular?
t1_dt6ioba	0	*	The Earth has a limit, yes.
t1_duks86e	1	*	They also say he's 6'3 and 239 lbs
t1_dukf3pg	1	*	yes.  getting a 30 year old pregnant woman over a wall with ropes is a bit of a hurdle.  nobody's claiming the wall will completely solve the issue.
t1_duk9gt0	1	*	Yeah I know
t1_duk4ceo	1	*	But I know the Russians, they are good guys. Tough cookies. 
t1_dujmn7u	0	*	Because what she believes is true is evil.   Ted Bundy believed he should kill people. He didnt think he would csught, he didnt live in fear of getting caught.   Was he not evil?
t1_dulsdfl	0	*	Lol you generally don't get banned unless you break some rules.

t1_dujx6r2	0	*	The one currently in office
t1_dukh9kv	1	*	I read it that way since it's Trump's MO.  See Liddle Adam Schiff, etc.  
t1_dul82zx	0	*	what in particular has he done to be impeached?
t1_duk1vjy	0	*	Compared to the rest of the world virtually everyone in the US rich. It's all relative
t1_dujl5t3	1	*	I would love that
t1_duk09au	1	*	Oh my bad. Clearly you have experience in complicated criminal investigations. Who would have known that someone who speaks in memes was so knowledgeable about in depth investigations. U0001f644
t1_dujxjlj	0	*	> Did Trump know this?   I would consider this to be common knowledge, so yes I would expect Trump to have known this.
t1_dukby4q	0	*	You're missing my point. Socialism and communism *always* claim to be for the people. You're acting like it's some new idea, no no no, THIS time we REALLY mean it!
t1_duk2qhj	0	*	But can't it be argued that this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story can be referring to the collusion rather than the meddling? 
t1_duk9xnd	1	*	Lol, the sanctions against Russia were supported by both parties. I really hope your delusion is just trolling. 
t1_duk2amc	1	*	Nope. You're just making up shit to get offended over
t1_dtkfrfs	0	*	I've had multiple women go ewww at my cut cock.
t1_dtjic2q	1	*	He asked if being uncircumcised was a religious thing? Ironic.
t1_dtl8y8o	0	*	No it doesn't it traps dirt. That's why you have to pull it back to properly clean it.  I've also never had segnma. Cleaninliness is definitely not an advantage in that sense. 
t1_dtlh4ds	1	*	Yeah lots of crazy things happen in the world.
t1_dtjrp0c	1	*	>Except not a single person in this comment chain claimed it's an equivelant loss  You are incorrect. A poster on the same level as your reply here asserted as much
t1_dtjse8o	1	*	Had to do circumcision at 28, it's way less pleasant to have sex after that.
t1_dtjp0ul	0	*	So the line is fine where it happens to precisely, and arbitrarily conform to what you happen to grow up believing. Solid logic.
t1_dtj8t8n	1	*	It diffenetly does now. Thanks for the clarification. 
t1_dtjzoc8	0	*	And dried stains on your mattress resemble corn flakes
t1_dtk0d15	0	*	baby mutilator
t1_dtjh696	0	*	Why compare what is often a necessity for travel with a completely optional surgery?  Not even close to the same thing.
t1_dtj78p5	0	*	This whole thread is entirely opinion based.  I'm not blind. I can see the difference. But the difference between me and you is, I could not care less. 
t1_dtj87ko	1	*	Nice try, bad comparisons.

t1_dt1mzgi	1	*	He's cheated on all his wives.  He cheated on the first wife with the woman who became his second wife.  He's a serial cheater.
t1_dt2ggdd	1	*	I really have to thank Trump for revealing to us in the rest of the world it's just a bunch of laundry detergent eating spastics doing whatever fake news tells them.
t1_dsj6rrv	0	*	A Catholic priest?
t1_dsj7qsc	0	*	The bottom line is if the aunt took Zainab to religious studies and picked her up then she would still be alive. Why are you ignoring that point twice in a row?
t1_dupyxy7	0	*	But you said you dont need strength to push a giant ice skate. Why would you need more strength if you dont need strength to begin with. Makes no sense. Bro, do you even lift?  I know olympics. 
t1_duawfgl	1	*	Thats wasnt me. Im just giving you some generally good advise. 
t1_dtpjxom	1	*	That's the best part of it! Maybe that's because I never outgrew my Oedipus complex though. Incest is fine as long it's betweeb consenting adults.
t1_dv06d3f	0	*	So this is why both coffee an GPUs have doubled in price lately... goddamn sneaky Canadians!  Oh wait.. didn't an American company recently buy Hortons..? :)

t1_dv0gh63	0	*	Hmm. Weathers about to turn here towards the weekend. Cold and snow coming. So used to the warmth already I don't want it to leave. 
t1_dv1170s	1	*	Campsites are an additional cost over the park pass. So it would be $136 + $28 a night (avg in the places Ive been). 
t1_dv1pjwd	0	*	Hundreds of deaths in a country with close to half a billion people is a minuscule number. More people are killed by lightning every year than long guns.
t1_dv0r5e4	0	*	Bit of an overreaction to a simple question like

t1_dsy81f1	0	*	And to think I used to think and act exactly like your average r/thedonald -er
t1_dsxrg51	0	*	Too bad, Nintendo. Sorry.

t1_dsz274h	1	*	Even more likely, in fact.
t1_dsxo51y	1	*	That's right, I should have used better wording, I just wanted to make it simpler to visualize why the earth might not get engulfed. 
t1_dsy0sdr	1	*	This is why religion is dumb.

t1_dsxxeu9	0	*	Maybe that could be fixed by using cells that cannot reproduce on the tough lining of the oil digestive system. I don't know if that is possible though.
t1_dsy8dwm	1	*	Diet and that one.
t1_dsyk0u3	1	*	Most of the corn grown in the US is used to feed livestock, not make sugar. If corn goes up in price, so does your chicken and beef. 
t1_dsy7r8b	0	*	K-log!
t1_dsz263z	1	*	Well, *I* didn't have any other plans for this week. I'm willing to give it a shot if everyone else is.

t1_dv0s32d	0	*	The EU can't do this unilaterally, and so far both the UK and NI governments are noping this idea.
t1_dv1gqvp	1	*	It's almost like there's a ton of money involved in swaying public opinion and people should just learn the facts and not blindly follow huge organizations.
t1_dv1iphr	0	*	I would, but then I'd just get sued by Monsanto because some seeds seeds were blown over from my neighbor's farm.
t1_dv19it8	0	*	Incorrect its a problem because of the unregulated spraying of it. Nothing else. 
t1_dv0ydy1	0	*	Standard definition, lol. There's no standard definition of what a mass shooting is.
t1_dv0w5ry	0	*	That hasnt happened tho. So...
t1_dv0xaq0	0	*	I agree 100%, haven't heard of r/neutralpolitics but it sounds like my thing, thanks for the recommendation I'll check it out!
t1_dv0ox7g	0	*	I think it is also unlikely that the EU bans their use completely.  This is a huge Bayer product (1b/year).  They will lobby pretty hard to have a much more limited ban.
t1_dv0x19v	0	*	Thanks for coming through. I hadn't heard of any of those, but it seems the US still has far more.
t1_dsuonfd	0	*	The Soviets would have rolled on Europe at the first sign of Nuclear aggression. They would have made it to The Coast faster than the Nazis did. Our forces in Germany at this time paled in comparison.
t1_du8qjm3	0	*	I would then encourage people to file their own taxes and make the tax-filing industry irrelevant.
t1_du927iw	0	*	Depends where you live I suppose. It's not that simple to just invent a new tax without proper peer review. Unless you just executive order everything like in the U.S.
t1_du8e7d1	0	*	Just off the top of my head, in Stockholm and London you are charged the vast majority of the day but not weekends.
t1_duv78su	0	*	Paywalled :) but just Portland alone had more kiddie rape per capita than Rotherham did https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-or/legacy/2013/10/29/the_csec_report.pdf  Lol
t1_dsd7230	1	*	Let's be real, if the people cause enough ruckus demanding something...she could do something and it would be forgiven (but not forgotten).
t1_ds1zin9	1	*	Yes.  Read the edit.
t1_dun8pzn	0	*	Why not? Evidence supports it. You cant scream fake news just because you dont like being the bad guys.
t1_dul0g76	0	*	Are you Canadian or American in this scenario. You seem to have labelled yourself as both. 
t1_duy0wqg	1	*	I don't follow your line of reasoning.  You jumped from North Korea policy to bashing the south, for no apparent reason.  Who even mentioned the south before your ignorant comment?
t1_dulhz0f	1	*	It was more than half of the electoral Congress and almost half of the popular vote. He didn't lose the popular vote by a large margin it was 2% less.
t1_dun50ku	0	*	That's the point. Interactions between random people and sovereign states is very different. It's stupid to draw up such comparisons.
t1_dsi1n9h	0	*	I don't care what you think. I'm not here to earn internet points. And I'm not gonna hold your little hand like your mom and walk you through basic reasoning skills.

t1_dsmo750	1	*	Eh? No, it's certainly real.  It's not a particularly big deal (at least, relative to things like net worth), but it's still a thing.
t1_dsmty8k	1	*	My point exactly.

t1_dsmz7tj	1	*	That's the most biased bs I've ever read lmao
t1_dsmyc5q	0	*	Look at their most controversial post of all time, it reached all and went straight to 0. There are more trump haters than supporters, and the format of reddit crushes discussion in that situation.
t1_dso43nu	0	*	Personally I think it's important to bear in mind the relative educational attainment of Brexit and Trump supporters. For you to conflate that with a meaningless response is just childish.
t1_dsmpy14	0	*	Those are the best Dollops, when they dive into the horrifying head first and Gary is blindsided by the craziness.

t1_dsmwfuc	1	*	If you think the prison system and the criminal justice system are two separate entities, I've got some news for you, and you may not like it...

t1_dst75nu	0	*	> It's improving, but we're still largely a carbon-reliant society  It's changing at a rapid pace, so by 2030 we should be pretty well off, if not 100% at that point.
t1_dtytyre	1	*	I'm pretty sure I could sniff out their bullshit when they decide to prescribe me rosehips instead of actual medicine.
t1_dtyw70q	1	*	Or maybe those are just bad doctors. Those exist, too.

t1_dtywcb6	1	*	Seriously.  Or go see a physical therapist and get your back muscles stronger.  A fucking chiropractor isn't going to do shit for that.  
t1_dtzgqun	0	*	I would tell you to seek some help from a mental institution but you don't have many good ones there. All I can say is I'm sorry you have to live life in your condition. :/ Hope it gets better!
t1_dtyv994	1	*	Unfortunately that's a insane marketing tactic to get patients you did the right thing.
t1_du0vdas	0	*	Thank you. I did.  I think it's interesting that creationism is included there. The hypothesis that the earth is ~6,000 years old is easily disproven.
t1_dtyxgkf	0	*	Right. I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't a service. I'm just saying it's a valuable service, just should not be viewed as medical advice, but will make you feel better
t1_duuw9y9	0	*	Not ANOTHER person, ALL THE OTHER PERSONS

t1_dszjd0h	0	*	No, did you? We're talking cost of healthcare. If you can't find the flaw in paying twice per capita than Canada, your neighboring country, then hope is lost.

t1_dt0nneu	1	*	Nope. Never said they liked us. Merely saying they were less openly hostile. At the moment, their interest also align with ours in the region. Hysterics get you nowhere
t1_dt12emv	0	*	Thanks for that information, but the war and started during Obama's term. How has it changed over the last year with the new administration? 
t1_dt0r68y	0	*	And just not caring about consequences is what's bad.
t1_dss4llt	0	*	1) no it isn't 2) Just because something is in the lab doesn't mean it becomes a product.

t1_duy9wai	1	*	Well your original sentence showed you don't pay much attention to detail, so a little harm done.
t1_dur6eft	0	*	Like the guy in FL? Seems like there were plenty of signs. The police didnt seem to care though.

t1_dscd7e7	1	*	Sure you did Captain America
t1_dsbqf0g	1	*	So shameful... *tut, tut*... gambling!
t1_dsbnm63	0	*	Yet they cast the blame on us for being deviant, sinful and immoral...  Holy shit.....naked prostitute racing....never thought I'd see the day..
t1_dsd0qh5	1	*	fair enough
t1_dswl5mo	0	*	Yea, I'm sure the US military is going to start dropping bombs on their own neighborhoods. It's not like they have friends or families who live in the country.
t1_dsvuqhg	0	*	He stumped for an Assault Weapons ban in 2012, this isn't some conspiracy theory.

t1_dsw13ak	1	*	Wikipedia is not a reliable source of information. It even says that list is incomplete. If you look at the sources, you can see that some data is from before 2000!

t1_du9z4ya	0	*	You're resorting to insults because you feel insecure.
t1_ds1jb6t	0	*	Refs understand these scenarios 
t1_dulxhc7	1	*	Agreed. They are both problems to be sure. But you can't equate a fully functioning systemic insurgency with the one off rogue types that are letting rounds go in schools and Vegas etc. 
t1_dumz4xw	1	*	I see. Fair enough then.
t1_dumfpwo	0	*	If you fought in Afghanistan you fought to make sure this happens to many more young men each year

t1_duqd3zi	0	*	Thats a different interpretation of a grammatically ambiguous statement
t1_dumhry3	1	*	That realisation that I'm not a broken human and that humans are so resilient is what ultimately brought me out of my depression. You are bang on
t1_dtsgotn	1	*	Not the issue, but keep strawmanning as if it makes a difference m8. 
t1_dtruzgl	0	*	Italians commit crime therefore mass immigration from Africa is a good thing.   Hurrrrp Duuurrrp. Do you think before you type?
t1_dsl6ejp	0	*	Lol ok. I'm sure Haitians and Africans in the US will get off welfare any day now.
t1_dskrhd2	0	*	There was also the exercise between F-35s and F-15Es (which apparently had AESA radars) where the F-35 acheived an 8:0 kill ratio.

t1_dsjwc13	1	*	Boy i never realized i didn't have the right to Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Seriously what an odd thing to say.
t1_dsjyjkt	0	*	> Maryland and New Jersey are shit holes.  Did you read what I said? The places are shit holes. I did not say anything about the people. THINK for once in your life, instead of reacting. 
t1_dsjw4tu	0	*	Unfortunately, and he said nothing of the sort
t1_dsk6nnn	0	*	We have borders that are illegally crossed often. Immigration from Mexico is lower due to the Trump effect but that doesn't mean letting illegals stay. They have to go back.
t1_dsjyjme	0	*	There you go again with your shitty generalizations. Maybe its simply that I dont surround myself with shitty people. Maybe you should think about trying that yourself. 
t1_dskeuyu	0	*	France is like virtually every other country, it has good and bad areas. It's a large country (66 million people) so pleanty of arseholes as well as lots of good people too.
t1_dsk0yw3	1	*	SHOW ME THE MONEEEEYYY
t1_dsjw28s	1	*	Its the medias fault that my terrible president said terrible things. My Dorito Jesus cant be responsible for anything he says  There. Thats what you meant to say. Say what you mean you sycophant. 
t1_dsjwf3j	1	*	Well I did not know that
t1_dsk56fv	1	*	With all the evidence of this guys loose lips that's your stance?  What a loser.
t1_dsjtnwo	1	*	As do the parts who maintain that Hillary was a viable candidate. I mean the proof is literally sitting in the white house if it not in Florida or playing golf.
t1_dsjvemd	1	*	> But we all answer to Marty.  So like if I walk into the room and shout hey Marty like 40 heads are going to turn my way?
t1_dsk5wfu	1	*	I reserve every right to get emotional about this man ruining my country... And to get upset at idiots who defend him with pseudo intellectual half witted arguments composed by their leader
t1_dsk7w2z	1	*	The Democrats want to do that btw.

t1_dsk4qux	1	*	Google
t1_dsk5ana	0	*	I did ask you specific questions which you refused to answer. What are your specific criticisms of this administration? How do you think the President should respond to this incident?

t1_dsk14pq	0	*	What are you even talking about?  Where the fuck are you getting this kind of blanket criticism of my character, you have nothing to base it on.  Shitty attempt at an insult, won't take the bait

t1_dskebvb	1	*	Human well being?! If their country isnt a shithole why dont they stay?
t1_dsk140w	0	*	Drone strikes were a better choice in his position than alternatives that put soldiers in direct danger. I don't support it, but your example is bad.
t1_dsk8ptp	0	*	But one party is insane.
t1_dsk4ckp	1	*	As it is in the US. Social Security works that way. And I think you have to provide 401, though not everyplace matches.

t1_dsjzo4y	1	*	Well, to be fair people in some counties just don't like him so sometimes that might be enough for him to hate on a place
t1_dsk4zk9	1	*	Name literally one thing Republicans support that is good and that Democrats dont also support.
t1_dsk5dd7	1	*	It's really not bad at all. It's all in the nuance. Sanders cited his numbers even if he used the wrong word, trump made his up.
t1_dskohjz	0	*	oh hey, now we have a source for Trumps comments  http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/368686-durbin-fires-back-at-trump-denial-he-said-those-hateful-things-and-he-said
t1_dsjyw32	1	*	Conveniently forgetting that they already exist in the form of health insurance companies...
t1_dsk658a	0	*	Sure they should. But the decision should be based on rational and ethical criteria.  What you are suggesting is neither rational nor ethical.
t1_dsjvtwo	0	*	And what about the other end of the spectrum? This only talks about poverty? Try looking at rates of higher education. 
t1_dsk94ns	0	*	huts? wow dude.
t1_dsk6nqu	0	*	We have before. Iraq, for starters.
t1_dskjraq	1	*	Yeah we have room for another 150 million low skilled, low education workers pushing down wages who also will all need welfare once automation comes into play. I can't foresee that backfiring, no way!
t1_dsjve2g	1	*	I find it hilarious that you're the only one who keeps bringing up Obama
t1_dskb50g	1	*	Ah. Damn. 
t1_dsjwq45	1	*	I think you're kind of getting off the point here.
t1_dsk9ihz	1	*	Which is why most of this thread is incredibly ironic and mostly hypocritical.   Some comments in other places were saying WHY SHOULD NORWEGIANS COME TO THE U.S.!  Literally doing the same thing.
t1_dsjuonp	0	*	It's not that you don't have time, you don't have evidence.  
t1_dsqo128	0	*	What we should _do_, is stop looking at the world with this sort of Us vs. Everyone Else mentality...
t1_dsjuz5o	1	*	De nada moochacho
t1_dsk5lek	1	*	How so?
t1_dsjwsw8	1	*	Sounds like Fake History to me!
t1_dsjqtf3	1	*	That's exactly who Steve Bannon was complaining about. 
t1_dsjymts	1	*	I'll go ahead and say it for you. /u/SupraRZ95 seems to be pretty damn racist from the comments that I have seen.
t1_dt5wf1c	1	*	OP it is Metro which has as much credibility as Buzzfeed. Its not your fault if you didn't know.
t1_dtsupua	0	*	Illegals dont pay taxes 
t1_ds1r96h	0	*	You have gotten be under 25 then maybe?
t1_dtd1hu6	0	*	No you just don't understand that your political opinion is only an opinion, because you're naive to yourself and your snake charmer.
t1_dv1qwme	0	*	Well Ill move the goal post a little and imply that they are not the same ghettos and are made up of different people who are committing different crimes. 
t1_dta8oif	0	*	Show me the real statistic then.  Right now you're going on faith of another Reddit user.  Until then I'm going to go by the actual article we're reading.
t1_du7y34o	1	*	Thats because the person they were responding to hasnt taken their finger out of their ears.
t1_dthd2y9	1	*	Of what? That a Clinton partisan wrote a memo? 
t1_dta2w0k	0	*	Might is right yeah? Thats what you said. Its your claim not mine  Why make a distinction though between Nazis and israel? You changing the goalposts?
t1_dta1b31	1	*	There was nobody in those schools at the tine, no students, no UN armed or not, just buildings left empty for summer.
t1_dtl8gid	0	*	I'll go with the realistic view as opposed to your wishful thinking

t1_dv1a8o9	0	*	Nobody does and ding ding...
t1_dt6mrj5	1	*	I'm not concerned about a robotic takeover.  But I don't think we need true AIs for a economic shift anyway.  Automated cars aren't AIs but they will have millions out of work within 10 years.
t1_dt60q8l	1	*	Financial success doesn't but *achievement* does. If little Johnny Warbux wants to be an artisinal cabinatemaker, he'd better be the best damned artisinal cabinatemaker there is.
t1_dt5yeso	0	*	Yes. I was assuming a generally accepted number being between 58 and 77 with only two studies supporting the two higher numbers.  
t1_dt5vzqp	0	*	But a FAR cry from 90%.
t1_dtvp0i2	0	*	Because Africans are people too, people who at a later age get circumcision to fight the AIDs epidemic. Jesus christ people. You're a bunch of Jenny McCarthy clones.
t1_dtx1tfp	1	*	That's not what every other country's pediatric/medical associations say.  I'm against MGM and FGM and I disagree with the APA, but misrepresenting what people say is not going to help us.

t1_dtqk6nk	0	*	I'm an American and I don't have the slightest bit of respect for donald trump.

t1_dthl948	0	*	You do not have basic reasoning and logic skills. 
t1_dthcxg4	1	*	I never claimed that they were.
t1_dtz3is8	1	*	The jury decides guilt, the justices decide constitutionality. If you have an unfavorable jury, youre fucked, no matter what the constitution says.
t1_ds5yv4c	1	*	1) In a particularly and directly political context, using a particularly biased source weakens your argument.  2) Let's not argue.  3/4) Thank you for the more reasonable source.

t1_ds6y73y	1	*	Whats inappropriate about it? It is one of the best documents in the world and you know that.
t1_ds5z13q	1	*	Ew. Listen to music when you drive, then read a real newpaper
t1_ds6ajw0	0	*	Biased is not fake, though. It's just selected news, but the news is factually true. Every news outlet is somehow biased.
t1_ds5vaqg	0	*	Well considering that your taxes go to support bankruptcy courts and welfare systems, yes you do should your friend decide to avail himself of the resources available to him. 
t1_ds5tka7	1	*	If you have nothing to add to the conversation the normal reaction is to not say anything at all.
t1_dt0brft	1	*	The g is silent, so....
t1_dukwyhs	0	*	So should we also not protect Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands militarily? After all they dont contribute to the defense budget. 
t1_dujda2n	0	*	Oh no I was challenging your proposition that pedophilia is built in to our oldest institutions.   Just thought you might be able to justify that beyond a whimsical throwaway line for upboats.
t1_dx3xkhe	1	*	You said it was a gift, even though the government funding its territories, state or not, is literally why it exists . Those weren't words, it was your foot U0001f602
t1_dsfp860	0	*	Ah, that make more sense; I was starting to wonder how you deal with vagrants and squatters if there is no such thing as trespassing.  I take it breaching through a barrier is a crime as well.
t1_dtxzuzf	0	*	I suspect the end of the world stuff was fabricated by some IT manager who knew it was the only way upper management could be convinced to give appropriate resources to correct the system. 
t1_dty0aew	1	*	The time doesn't change, but the time things happen changes is what I'm saying.  ITT: People who don't understand Mountain Time trying to tell someone who's lived it he's wrong.

t1_dty4ag8	0	*	They change their arrival times by an hour. Why? 
t1_dty91da	0	*	Ok, then that's where our different opinions come from. 
t1_dty1igv	0	*	Depends on where in the uk you are. In Edinburgh,where I am, it'll stay light until about 1am and it's only for a few hours. I'm always shocked at how early it gets dark in England during summer.
t1_dtye5el	0	*	Of course, here in southern Arizona it's so freaking hot in the summer that NOBODY wants extra evening sunlight.
t1_dty5rg5	1	*	I'm not even a computer guy but I got 6 weeks overtime testing out our companies systems for Y2K.

t1_dtymphp	1	*	I think it's pretty safe to say that DST isn't clogging arteries or causing heart disease, but I'm no doctor
t1_dty9u2h	0	*	But they have to go to the store eventually and that store cares what time it is. So farmers have to care, too.

t1_duekxjq	1	*	You did a good job refuting the person who said that American airports don't have enough international traffic but you're wrong about not having to go through customs & security.
t1_duf6mhv	1	*	It involves Russian mobsters, of course it's real.
t1_duf7llr	1	*	Even if it is a BS story, shit like this happens every day all over the world. Humans are terrible to each other 
t1_duelbse	1	*	He's only saying that other scenarios are possible. Occam's razor doesn't apply.
t1_dufzjj3	1	*	American -- no shit. If your nation had interference from said Russia and voted the scummiest creature as their pres. you'd be spittin mad too.
t1_dueeo42	0	*	Because that is definitely not blatant discrimination.
t1_duf4ple	0	*	Tourist countries protect their tourists in tourist towns though. They weren't vacationing in rural Afghanistan.

t1_duqo238	0	*	No he did not. That is a very ignorant thing to say.
t1_dt3xg3g	0	*	...Or they can just wait it out? How about that? Not starting a war, and not turning belly-up towards the US, how's that for an option?
t1_dt56tna	1	*	Lol, it happens

t1_dv1en9h	1	*	So were gonna annex them without asking? Hmm...bold move.

t1_dubuspz	0	*	So much edge.

t1_dsf41kk	1	*	I heard that the apricot or peach kernels can be very shard and actually cut the skin. Since they are crushed you don't notice first but it's really bad in the long term
t1_dsey4ol	1	*	Keep the tech and medicine, cut back on all the other crap and stop making things with planned obsolescence in mind. Go back to to giving things forever.
t1_dsf8dsc	1	*	Am wasp, can confirm
t1_dsf5i5v	0	*	Yes but all studies I can find on them being bad is from 2014-2018. I may just be bad at finding stuff or it's like Freon and smoking etc were we just didn't know it was bad. 
t1_dsexfmt	1	*	Yes you have! It's a common word amongst people who craft/work with textiles, and fashionistas, but not everyone will know it even with English as a native language :)
t1_dtinwck	1	*	Yeah that was a fact. Do you need sources that the grass is green? lol 
t1_dtiy6u6	0	*	You didn't say it, but you support and defend an administration that did.   How does that work? 
t1_dti7yhy	0	*	I do think its relevant to continue to claim its fake or suspicious after doing a very minimal amount of logical thinking about the situation, which was my point... 
t1_dti95kq	1	*	I got the impression that he was pulling a switcheroo and was actually joking.
t1_dtk2qza	0	*	>But there has now surfaced much ACTUAL evidence that the Clinton's opposition blah blah  Let's see it, then. Opinion pieces are not evidence.
t1_duqrm86	0	*	What's that have to do with the topic? The later USSR (not Russia) was imperialist and shitty. That doesn't change the fact the US supported and encouraged Saddam to gas innocent people in the 80s.

t1_dusajuh	1	*	Yeah isn't that fucked, it's literally beyond anyone's ability to truly grasp.  The old adage the enemy of my enemy is my friend is absolutely false in Syria at least 60% of the time.
t1_dtnsd19	1	*	46% means minority. If you can't grasp basic math and statistics that even children can grasp then you're obviously of sub-par intelligence.
t1_dtlr795	0	*	Generic dislike is such a soft term for what the previous commentors explained.
t1_dtl7zma	0	*	Jews cant call out antisemitism because then were just being whiny Jews. 
t1_dtlgueo	0	*	why would I need to state it when the quoted text clearly, very clearly states it?    mislead my ass.  
t1_dt2yj8k	0	*	I don't see how that would make Italy less laughable at. It's a beautiful country. Maibe THE beautiful country, that doesn't change that has lost his place as first world country.

t1_du6qbpi	1	*	lol you have a strange way of conveying your point mate, i'll give u that. still can't make out what you're trying to get at but hey, what do i know. 
t1_dtx6k8o	0	*	Huh what? North Indians, East Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are same blood, all are part of the Indo-Aryan family. West Pakistanis are however a part of Iranian family i.e. the Pashtun and Baluch.

t1_dudfx79	0	*	That's debatable, although, it's kind of in his nature to live in the grey world between the two.  Par for the course (of which is plays too much golf, but what do I know, I'm not President).
t1_dudnvbq	1	*	Another way to present this concept in relevant terms. Skip to [p17](https://archive.org/details/BezmenovLoveLetterToAmerica)
t1_dud4z0k	0	*	Yes CLEARLY thats what Im doing. 24/7 Im spewing praises about Trump.  Grow up.
t1_dud7zeo	1	*	Except that many right wingers were holding off on whether or not  Russians tampered in the election. Now we have undeniable proof.
t1_dud62gh	0	*	Weird sentence structure, other comments seem sporadic and off-topic.

t1_dudgnm7	1	*	alright then I'm not really sure what you are asking here or how it relates to me trying to explain to someone how plea bargains and indictments are related 
t1_due0dk7	1	*	Because not doing so put Agent Orange in the white house 
t1_dudemsy	0	*	Wait.... didnt you technically call me a kid though?
t1_dudh8ce	1	*	Well there's no point saying that to me, America's behaviour is not up to me. Its still not dumb for them to protect themselves from attacks just because they have attached others.
t1_duda2io	1	*	I was wondering where all the down votes were coming from for such a widely held opinion 
t1_dud5w4f	1	*	They've probably already factored in your concerned reaction.
t1_dudd5ft	1	*	Divide and conquer.
t1_dudexod	0	*	Republicans are largely ignoring attempts bt Russia to undermine the basis of our democracy. Democrats are not calling for anyone to be disenfranchised for being susceptible to those attempts.

t1_dy1ujcu	1	*	haha, of course! Although you had time to reply to this comment though, didn't you?
t1_dsitzqx	1	*	I think you might have put that better than I did
t1_duusbsb	1	*	I'd probably blame it more on the American and to a lesser extent British political climate, going back at least to Reagan and Thatcher. It's mainly that the 2008 crisis saw all Hell break loose.
t1_duuwqwt	0	*	The world in which we live is constantly in flux. That's what makes it worthwhile to encourage learning. Education is the only way to fight the echo chamber effect. 
t1_duur7fd	1	*	Wood it?
t1_dshkvwu	1	*	I always heard it like a ship has an elevator and a boat doesnt.
t1_dtgi389	1	*	You should read the article posted above 
t1_dt3t0yu	1	*	Reddit doesn't like the truth.

t1_dstfvqa	1	*	I know, it was me!
t1_du6jjdd	1	*	Yeah, that isn't true at all. Russia didn't even help with ISIS until Aleppo fell. Their goal was to prop up Assad, not fight ISIS.
t1_dt6pmcv	1	*	Doesnt mean it has to stay false. 
t1_dt7drka	1	*	Fuckin' hell.
t1_dt6qpk1	1	*	Whos the most?
t1_dt6ilkm	1	*	but reddit /r/politics told me that Islam is the ally of gays and women and if you think otherwise you're a bigot. 
t1_dt6tayb	0	*	Not at this very moment, that we know of. But it's not like you have to go back in time very far to find examples.
t1_dt6eki0	0	*	Why should we help them? If they decided that they wanted to be their own countries now they are the ones that have to solve their problems. 
t1_dt0fu2c	0	*	Why didn't you comment on the other link then. Better be pedantic about the validity of the other. Fucking troll.

t1_ds6fm2y	1	*	House of Tards.
t1_ds5e5lp	0	*	Well, so is Islam, and here we are. It's a movement of contradictions. You could say no true leftist but that's how they identify and who they nominally support.

t1_dsg4mm7	0	*	Well, that's the difference between a democracy and an ethnocracy.
t1_dv2gkfv	0	*	So what? Better to use a gun to commit suicide than to jump in front of a train or try other painful methods.  Not to mention that suicide is cultural and has little to do with guns.
t1_dth65bv	0	*	Because it's a US 'Oligarch List'... from the US Treasury Department... 
t1_dslpumv	0	*	It doesn't matter. He performed an unecessary procedure with no medical benefit. This was beyond what the patient consented to and as such should be classed as assault or mutilation.

t1_dv4u8ap	0	*	The link proves that everything you are making up has no validity dating back to the earliest days of td. If you cant look at the link and see that then... Sorry? I guess?
t1_dv40rb2	0	*	> wasn't Bernie absolutely robbed at a fair chance to become the Democratic nominee  No.
t1_dv3bkff	0	*	Jews fleeing Germany as refugees were denied entry, turned away at ports and sent back to the camps.  Trump's refugee policy.  Does it compute?
t1_dv44olg	0	*	Except Obama and Clinton were not much different on this score and they were absolutely fine with him in both of his elections.   I wonder why Reddit had such a problem with HER.....
t1_dv39mf8	0	*	I was banned from the Donald for one post, I replied to a comment about illegal immigration and said only citizens can vote.  This level of censorship is clearly unamerican.
t1_dv3d6t4	1	*	Right. It's likely how Rampart happened. It's objectively *bad*, but it's still only bad. To be absolutely clear, it's low-ratings swill. 
t1_dv3t7bt	1	*	It doesn't take a political genius to realize what direction this state leans heavily towards every time.
t1_dv3hua5	1	*	Oh I guess it was just you then.   
t1_dv38uwi	1	*	The point is to get it down to 10% disruptive bots instead of 70% or whatever the total is. It'll improve the discourse site-wide. Nobody's saying we can get rid of all paid shills/bots/trolls.
t1_dv5fdbu	1	*	From what I can gather (being part of the meme supporting of Trump) there's a bunch of compilations of You Can't Stump the Trump which sstart with this
t1_dv3of9n	0	*	Who exactly?
t1_dv3f8bu	1	*	leaders and important figure heads have said they would never run for president because it fucking sucks.
t1_dv3fyws	0	*	It means exactly that, it doesn't work right now.  In the future anything can happen so to make a comment about a hypothetical future scenario is pretty pointless when talking about the law.
t1_dv37yro	0	*	One's a person in genuine need and the other is an advertisement?
t1_dv39bmv	0	*	The idea of fragile masculinity is pretty well established at this point. Sometimes it'll even start to crumble in the presence of colors like pink, or flowers.
t1_dv38wwv	0	*	The hell? Do you not remember the weeks before the addition of /r/popular and /r/all filtering when the front page of all was 50% The_Donald posts?  I downloaded RES just because of that shit.
t1_dv3t4sr	0	*	I love our government!         They keep us safe, and do their bet for us.          Please don't lock me up Government!

t1_dv36bfr	0	*	people supported bernie *because of his policies*  that was like. the main thing behind him lol. kinda important.
t1_dv39txs	0	*	That's my thought, too. We know the warrant canary is gone, so doesn't that at least indicate a strong possibility that whatever is going on at least temporarily has their hands tied?
t1_dv3durk	0	*	Perhaps then stop making claims about something you don't care enough to spend 40 seconds googling. Or don't, it's your life.

t1_dv3q4od	1	*	Read further down--the massive see we call the Reddit and calls trump the golden lion.  He writes the way Boris Badenov talks.

t1_dv4t2r2	0	*	Except the study found that the people who they studied didn't say hate spread hate after the fact the subreddit was banned. 
t1_dv3i6e9	0	*	The other posibility is they are actually afraid that if they shut that sub down they will be the target of terror attacks. I could almost understand that honestly.
t1_dv3c7th	1	*	Ayyy!
t1_dv4lcub	1	*	The hippy fans were mostly from *Stranger in a Strange Land*.  I don't recall that being a major theme of the book.

t1_dv37s9m	0	*	antifa has never killed a single person or Nazi.
t1_dv39gxu	0	*	That's what happens when you're disenfranchised.  You latch onto a group that makes you feel like you belong and you're part of something, whether it's a gang, the KKK, or the Republican party.
t1_dv3tpty	1	*	Ah, I see what you mean now. Thank you so much! That's very interesting. 
t1_dv3k5tq	0	*	Reddit was founded by free speech on the Internet libertarians. Banning /r/the_donald goes against that ethos, hence their great reluctance to ban that subreddit.
t1_dv37st9	1	*	...because the previous poster was asking for the picture. So I posted it. Very simple explanation.

t1_dt67hlg	1	*	Cool
t1_dt5hrpn	1	*	Republics aren't direct democracies.  There exist very few direct democracies in the world.
t1_dt6foh9	0	*	Ok.  So well let China (a censoring authoritarian regime) steal the entire South China Sea because you dont likely-likes the currently elected American President.  Sounds reasonable.

t1_dsff4yr	1	*	Of course it's a thing, but assuming that will be the result removes objectivity. That's how your first comment read, so I felt it important to point out.   
t1_dsew22y	0	*	I bet you believe in systemic racism against other people based on less evidence.

t1_dsskmi0	0	*	In The New Testament, aside from revelation, the violence is normally coming from the bad guys and Jesus is very pacifist, he even heals the ear of a guy who got his ear cut off by Peter.

t1_dtg59k3	1	*	C'mon man, that was a light jab. Ripping on Liberals is a conservative pass time. It was only a personal attack if I nailed your beliefs exactly and you are annoyed that I called it a safe space.
t1_dtgaxcs	1	*	I...ummm...oh...well I can't argue with that.
t1_dth9dh4	0	*	So was Malaysia.
t1_dtg2qu0	1	*	I'm not justifying it. What he did was morally wrong. It was also a solid political gamble. Both are true.  I'm just saying that his job is to win elections. That's the system. 
t1_dti1g4d	1	*	In Britain that IS how culture works. Culture (here) is based on institutions, you just let people flood in who disrespect them, there's no culture.

t1_dtg5kku	1	*	Hmm, seem fairly middle of the road financially from the time I've spent with them. They still need part-time jobs to support themselves.
t1_dtgnb2h	0	*	No, they are quite complete leaflets. The Swiss are weird like that. I believe they've even got that in their laws that the things need to be as objective as possible. 
t1_dtguude	1	*	I wonder why
t1_dtgxtwc	1	*	Lol bruh, you could literally break down every reason for doing any activity like that
t1_dtgdnif	1	*	But where do you vacation? What car do you drive? What clothes do you wear? How well maintained are your belongings and home? Do you have investments that you built from savings?
t1_dtg4oc2	1	*	The UK has a shit voting system anyway so I wouldn't look too far into parliament seats. But that's beside the point. They don't have the right to hold one whether they want one or not.

t1_dsinlqb	0	*	It takes all of three seconds of thought to realize how stupid of a statement this is. How many lives have been taken in the hunt for capital?

t1_dsmi5k5	0	*	You gotta try this site Google sometime. They've got so much stuff on there!  http://nordic.businessinsider.com/danske-bank-and-nordea-are-enmeshed-in-a-massive-money-laundering-scandal-2017-3/
t1_dsmesbj	0	*	Haha touche there. I guess it is possible to just hand a briefcase full of cash from one person to another XD
t1_dsmf72p	0	*	Okay? Just because it gets reported doesnt mean you cant do it. 
t1_dsmcofa	0	*	Well I have a feeling that our president is incompetent. Still hasn't done anything towards getting him out.
t1_dsmdr33	1	*	Supposedly it's a shitty job. 
t1_dsmj3c7	0	*	If I have to do the work of searching for sources for the article to seem legit than it is a shit article. Kapeesh?
t1_dsmh2wf	0	*	That seems like a double edged sword tbh. I'd be afraid of losing or misplacing my only legal claim to my property.
t1_dsmh0c7	0	*	Keeping subject on Haitian money laundering. 
t1_dsmf169	1	*	> you can even toss it in as collateral at a poker game if things get cra-zy.  Heh. The  guy who owned the building my dad used to have his office in, won it in a poker game.  
t1_dsmfyrw	0	*	Definitely not new, this has always been the norm friend.
t1_dsmgtrk	0	*	I goddamn near took my own life two years into a political science degree. The area of study was not a small component. I'm not even kidding. God bless you, man.
t1_dsmk2ks	0	*	The point is: not *anyone* would buy it, not at that price.
t1_dts1kdg	1	*	You misunderstood me. The hospital is the one that should be shopping around for the cheapest moisturizer, not the patient.
t1_dv0dmrm	0	*	Would've been the same even if he divulged only the domestic bit.
t1_dsof9p0	1	*	Engaging in a battle of wits with you guys would have been like kicking someone in a wheelchair.
t1_dsplz30	1	*	Ignoramus. See? Insults are easy. Knowing what you're talking about is hard, because you don't know either. Troll on, Russian separatist.  
t1_dso9vxo	0	*	You're completely right. So does America though.
t1_duh838l	1	*	Your entire team is cheating, so your team gets to sit out.  OMG HORRIBLE GUILT By ASSOCIATION!  Lol, are you even trying now?
t1_dt5kx9u	0	*	Yeah, the DOJ tends to frown on traitors, go figure.
t1_dueq2yu	0	*	Fair enough. Personally I don't have the energy right now to figure out what's what. These things are often fraught with misleading info. 
t1_dufjqm5	1	*	Pardon me? How hasn't it existed for decades? If the USSR collapsed in 1991 it's almost been 3 decades. 
t1_dugjvgz	1	*	Thank you. I am flattered. I even included my usual plethora of typos gratis. 
t1_dtsaz2y	1	*	I respect bravery and the call to duty, even if I disagree with a nations dictatorship.
t1_dsjsnsl	1	*	You don't think that has anything to do with the fact that Muslim-induced terror attacks have been growing at an alarming rate, yet white nationalist ones happen rarely. That never crossed your mind?
t1_dtkk7ew	1	*	I can murder you if that makes you feel better
t1_dtkfonb	0	*	Which explains the lack of Cage. 
t1_dtkboyv	1	*	Median or mean average? Weighted how: by population, by size of state, by volume of fuel sold, or not at all?
t1_dtkmvf5	0	*	That is hereditary though, youll be murdered at the exact same age as your grandpa was.
t1_dtleby3	1	*	Lol fair enough 
t1_dtlq69d	0	*	You research radio-therapeutic injections that are not systemic like an immune response would be from what i gathered. Maybe local isn't the right word. 
t1_dtka5e5	1	*	Is this when someone is supposed to say Le Gem in a sarcastic manner? 
t1_dtl5byd	1	*	Right, but the video talks about vague use and doesn't say one way or the other is right or wrong. Basically they're saying it's open to interpretation, so this is the way I interpret it
t1_du4p8q2	1	*	Wouldpaytosee/10
t1_dtkh7yz	0	*	> you missed their point  Yeah, that's why I made a joke about it. Because I missed it. Thanks.
t1_dtl1046	1	*	Keep up the good fight. You are 100% right, as you already knew. I have a dear friend who is impossibly healthy in every way and she too got cancer out of the blue. 
t1_dtkohio	1	*	Putting it on the other guys pie was part of the funny in that scene. The can looks like shaving cream, if believe serves (haven't watched the movie in a long time, need to fix that).
t1_dtkhepj	1	*	I don't think you understand my message.  A switcharoo is when the subject is switched. It is not the case here.
t1_dtktorj	1	*	Nice! My dad is an oncologist, but I don't want to ask him.
t1_dtk80ld	1	*	Jesus, you're like a broken goddamn radio!
t1_dtknkia	0	*	Cage 4 Lymphoma
t1_dtkd17a	0	*	I don't think he cared whether he died a legend or not I think he finally realized that he was boogey man of their world and accepted this was the new society and he would never have a place in it.
t1_dtmcvij	0	*	You're a big boy, you can use google
t1_dtk89mn	1	*	It needs to be at least 3 times bigger? Not much of a difference at that size though honestly
t1_dtkklsz	0	*	I work for Paramount. You just got yourself a contract. All you gotta do is show me your butt.
t1_dtldjad	1	*	And if they should grow so bad that they deplete the nutrients, you die. From bacteria, not cancer, so a small win
t1_dtle5ew	1	*	Because normally they dont. Unless autoimmune disease.
t1_duoloxc	1	*	Facts are anti-Semitic: watch yourself!
t1_dum4ccl	0	*	lmao Russia bought facebook ads, Israel is literally bribing our representatives  name other countries that have lobbies like AIPAC pls  
t1_dt5e3j3	0	*	No it isn't.   Canada's is about $45k and Alabama's is $42k.  You need to educate yourself before spewing garbage.
t1_dt573ex	0	*	They're bred to be large and seedless, flavor is not a concern.  
t1_dt5cgla	1	*	We'll take a wall, as long as they pay for it.
t1_dtho09e	1	*	I'm just bored and shitposting at this point
t1_dt5kkhx	1	*	HEY  !! Those of us who kan reed don't like hear in Mississippi it either! But, hay at least we ain't Arkansas!
t1_dt55kf6	0	*	Alabama, number one exporter of potassium      Other state have inferior potassium
t1_dt5pu0t	1	*	Sounds like you're stereotyping an entire population. There are all kinds of great people that live here and you come off as the ignorant one.
t1_dt5idhs	1	*	That's weird. I've had a wide range of watermelons in Canada ranging from pale and tasteless to cartoonish red, juicy as fuck, and pretty darn flavourful
t1_dt5bplt	1	*	You can thank the Arrogant Worms for that one.
t1_dt55ki4	1	*	*^(cough)*softwood*^(cough)*
t1_dt5dhiw	0	*	Theres a reason for those comments. The users 138k in Karma in under a year, making unpopular claims, is one of them. 
t1_dt56jn7	1	*	I didn't know Kelly Olynyk had a band
t1_dt5loh9	1	*	He said that they outsourced those jobs to Alabama and Mexico.
t1_dt5d7fd	1	*	They both work. There's and there are would both be correct.              I think. 
t1_dt5nnk1	0	*	More of a subjective quip than anything but it seems like half the time I look up a successful actor, they're Canadian.
t1_dt5bck5	0	*	I dont know where you lived in Alabama, but Im here and Im overall very happy.
t1_dt5njxg	1	*	The whole Canadian Rockies really. I spent a week driving through and it was one more gorgeous vista and lake after the next.
t1_dt5xvb3	0	*	I didn't realise so many on reddit were executives in IP heavy industries.
t1_dt5nw2a	1	*	Well I guess now it's... yep.

t1_dt5ky1m	1	*	I speak for all Calgarians when I say welcome to what we've been living with for centuries.
t1_dt5asbv	1	*	Nah, if Canadian markets opened up the US would reduce the subsidy.  The US could probably produce enough milk for Canada, Mexico, and half of SA if given the chance
t1_dt56nkg	1	*	beautiful
t1_dt5eu0l	0	*	You seem to think all manufacturing jobs involve low skill manual labor type work however there's a massive support team from engineering, quality and accounting who will all also lose their jobs. 
t1_dt6rkkt	1	*	space needle is some rookie shit. 184m? get outta here! Murica needs to up thier game, CN tower is 553.
t1_dt596ll	1	*	Mexican here. ^^^^^roll ^^^^^tide Don't really have anything to say other than that. 
t1_dt5i1sa	1	*	EC - Asbestos was one of the most appalling uses of ISDS ever and Canada should be ashamed about it.  
t1_dt76p57	1	*	I wanted it to be this video so much.  [The second edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzgAjjuqZM) was always my fav, though
t1_dt5a53g	0	*	Hmm, but can't automation be considered the same as just outsourcing labor to the machine-owners?
t1_dt5f646	0	*	Which has never been false. We have always paid more. Even when our dollar was the same and even higher for a brief moment we paid more. And businesses made less.
t1_dt55mk7	0	*	No, no, no, no, no.  Captain Tractor.
t1_dt6e64x	1	*	Those don't really exist. A big problem with many people's decisions are msm and social network sites. They play Trudeau off as boy wonder and trump as a terrible person when they're lying about both 
t1_dt5jj45	1	*	Nah, there's a light in there right next to the decayed remains of the real mother.
t1_dt5lsj4	0	*	Do you believe in community property?
t1_dt6wuui	1	*	Some perhaps, but not all. And therein lies the problem with any form of politics; People like me will gladly trade power, or the trust of the public, for money.
t1_dszu829	0	*	> Unless the interdicting ship opens fire on the intercepted vessel  Is there another way to stop a destroyer?
t1_dt3fsyv	0	*	They're not fighting with the US.
t1_dszothd	1	*	The U.S. is I can assure you.
t1_ds8kqmo	1	*	Are people from India flocking to UAE or people from UAE flocking to India?   
t1_duqewj2	0	*	> high-subsonic cruising speed of up to Mach 0.98.  I can see why no one wanted it, but I can't see the relevancy or what point you're trying to make.
t1_ds6zfca	0	*	Morsi was president for a year before he was deposed. You are obviously misinformed.
t1_duohbuq	1	*	He was saying the opposite.
t1_durt6b5	1	*	This is what the article says. They might have clipped the video due to the graphic nature of it. 
t1_dsz65i4	0	*	Yeah, that's because all the Syrians in Turkey are Islamists who ran away from Assad and his secular government.
t1_du4qj5h	1	*	>he thinks blog tier entertainment news like Vox/Washington post/CNN are the same as criminal investigations  Oh honey.... 
t1_du58133	1	*	What are your sources for it never having been inspected? Don't see any of that in any of the sources I found. What they do say is that a mold problem was discovered long after the purchase.
t1_du4mi1t	1	*	It's all relative, that doesn't matter.  Trump bought it on the cheap, and the shitty market is probably why he didn't get the $120M he was asking
t1_du4zrvv	0	*	What are you on about?
t1_du4qcbx	1	*	>he thinks blog tier entertainment news like Vox/Washington post/CNN are the same as criminal investigations  Oh honey.... 
t1_du4nna7	1	*	Is that how Donald would treat someone willing to give him $100 mil for a $40 mil property during the real estate crisis of 08? I'm not gonna pretend to be that stupid. 
t1_du4le6y	1	*	If you dont enjoy clickbaiting, Russia is making your life worse.  Thank you for at least refraining if youre unable to comprehend the point.  
t1_du8fy86	1	*	Agreed. It's really not a compelling reason at all. I think it speaks to the HRC loss. If any publicity is good publicity then DT gets a lot of good publicity.
t1_du4ike6	0	*	He has the best people to write the best words. People we have never heard of.
t1_du5db6r	0	*	No, I mean grasping at straws to make him look like the villain and attempting to fool the public with misleading information.
t1_du5glvd	0	*	The wrestler?
t1_du4lqj1	0	*	but he's so smart and has so much money. how could he have accumulated a debt that needed to be paid back now, not later?
t1_du4lzbh	0	*	Name calling didn't strengthen his point.
t1_du5ddfm	0	*	You people have learned nothing from your mistakes, absolutely nothing. It's ok, life will bite you in the ass again come 2020.
t1_du52uvs	1	*	Common deflection towards Trump's shortcomings is that we'd tolerate his behaviour six years ago. Which is partially true considering *he wasn't our fucking Nation's leader back then.*
t1_du4k4tu	1	*	How can I give a rebuttal to a total hypothetical? Lmao.    Also I dont watch cnn at all but good try!
t1_du4xp1t	1	*	Haha. That's hilarious I know some of the people on Yukon Men on Discovery channel. All those shows seem so fake. 
t1_du4sgmp	0	*	Where do you buy more?
t1_du4jqzd	0	*	I think the term you're looking for is ghost writer. Co-author implies Trump did some of the work.
t1_du53zw2	1	*	We shoulda never let them dang moose unionize.  Seems like every other year they all decide to stop moosing until they get a raise.  
t1_du4py5o	1	*	I'd like it much better if you do not play dumb, what I said is very obvious even for a 9-year-old it is very comprehensible 
t1_du4shp7	1	*	 not trying to be rude at all, sorry, it just seemed like you were acting a bit like a t_d troll
t1_du4m5nr	1	*	Richmond Hill's market was bonkers this past summer. 
t1_du4l1vs	0	*	The US *elected* Trump as pres. In comparison to that, Palin running for VP is a funny footnote.
t1_du4lamh	0	*	10+ years and this sale was never an issue or investigated by anyone, at least as far as I'm aware. 
t1_du4n2g6	1	*	Wow thats an even better explanation! I guess Ive always wondered why no matter how I typed it, my phone never attempted to auto correct it. Makes sense now that I look back. 
t1_du6e6rh	1	*	It's a saying, it means Come on now or Are you serious
t1_du4mam3	1	*	Wealthy areas in general didn't always follow the housing market.
t1_du4n7ee	1	*	I personally didn't find it to be out of line considering the tone of the comment he replied to (the_Dotard). To each his own, I guess.
t1_dv0uwkd	0	*	Because one is about exposing crimes whereas the other exists just to satisfy the lust of people who enjoy watching those things. You're comparing apple and oranges
t1_dsey24p	0	*	God forbid anyone is; taking responsibility over you is like rearing in a child. 
t1_dsdg322	1	*	I'm sure a Christian will be along soon to explain it to us.  Don't worry christians, im sure those african laws for putting gay people to death totally weren't funded in your name. Nope, not at all. 
t1_dsds13v	1	*	Come now, if I committed suicide whose posts would you follow and leave dumbshit replies to?
t1_dsecuw5	1	*	Well most lethal injections have something like this, but for some reason they can't get it to work reliably.
t1_dsgbcu6	0	*	>...except for the part where reddit puts an asterisk by posts that are edited more than five minutes after they're made  source 
t1_dseyulf	0	*	They were willing to risk their lives for their beliefs. I wouldn't make light of that. They are an inspiration of which to draw courage off of. 
t1_dsdb0hm	1	*	Imagine the funeral service though. Ew.
t1_ds3dh8j	0	*	Should have lost 100% of them. 
t1_ds3mfwe	0	*	yeah, because we are talking about the different policies of service providers and not about the multi million  penalty.
t1_ds38jj6	1	*	the president of the united states is still a private citizen and some of us can differentiate between the office and the man.
t1_dv56xdi	1	*	It's to protect us from them also.
t1_dsjoflt	1	*	If you havent found a source on this subject you must suck at internet.   Seriously, quit screeching sourcefor easily verifiable knowledge as a distraction. Its petty. 
t1_dskl4vd	0	*	The girl didn't consent to sex without a condom. That's a form of rape in my book.
t1_dtc55cv	0	*	Mostly because I moved from China to a different country some years ago and haven't used Chinese since then.
t1_dt90eh7	1	*	Its almost as if the world has a lot of old people who have acquired assets. Besides, the income and wealth numbers aren't necessarily the same groups of people. 
t1_dtyaqee	1	*	Stupidity is a learned habit.
t1_dtwm8rq	1	*	So is a story about someone you know... but not the fact people pay for his brand.
t1_dtwyjtf	0	*	#JIMMINY JILLIKERS
t1_dtwrdlb	1	*	Holy shit think of the memes. That would be all time peak memeage.
t1_dtwaki4	1	*	This is my point. I am sure if any said sex scandal has happened, our government has the full scope. What they are digging for is some real dirt.
t1_dtxdj9p	1	*	Sure. Though if I am not mistaken, the russians have a functioning healthcare system lol
t1_dtwbm3a	0	*	crazy facebook uncle how'd you end up on reddit? 
t1_dty8zck	1	*	Alright Ron Burgundy 
t1_dtx4fxh	1	*	You were the chosen one!
t1_dv1e7rf	1	*	Unarmed is a buzzword. Also a large majority of black people arent killed by racists or police like CNN would have you believe. Theyre killed by other black people. 
t1_dv1d1tf	0	*	If it was not visible from a public area such as a sidewalk yes.
t1_dv0xf4d	0	*	so, as someone who apparently has gotten the message from the sub, how do you justify sticking around looking at more death and gore?
t1_dv1gnnz	1	*	Because  shes a prolific political figure that publicly and explicitly violated a law which, since she ran for president, she should well know about?
t1_dv0u116	1	*	I dont think so either.
t1_dvs8rb1	1	*	How does the Netherlands having a small population make gay marriage obsolete?  As for the rights- right to healthcare ? Work rights protection? There are a lot of books on the subject.
t1_dv0wrfu	1	*	Pay is a large fine for posting a tweet.  No, thats ridiculous and I was making a point.  Then come to jail.  No.  Come at the point of a gun then.
t1_dv1n4g8	0	*	You can't not punish people because they are in the opposition.   There's no witchhunt, she knows exactly what she's doing.
t1_dv117es	0	*	thats how you view it, it's actually just showing people the truth
t1_dv2il5e	0	*	The most powerful and influential nation on the planet to which millions of people flock to get in?
t1_dv135g5	1	*	yes
t1_dv1dztm	1	*	But the point still stands that the government is allowed to jail people over it, if they want to, and it will be completely legal.
t1_dv0th8o	0	*	You should look into monopoly on violence and state power. If she refuses to obey she will be met with violence. It's inherent in every interaction with government. 
t1_dv0xq3c	1	*	>  free speech does not mean that you cannot shout 'fire' in a crowded theatre.  Infamously wrong, and really annoying people perpetuate that myth.
t1_dv0mn49	0	*	Not the same at all. 
t1_dv0rqz5	1	*	Yes. I know what I'm commenting on. I stand by what I said. The first amendment would protect this. 
t1_dv0mmcu	0	*	Let's go arrest everyone on watchpeople die. And bestgore.com And worldstarhiphop and liveleak....
t1_dv1tudb	0	*	It is. Especially on a medium such as the internet, which you choose to receive content.
t1_dv0okjh	0	*	You realize she didn't threaten anyone right? But thanks for spewing irrelevant stuff that four other tards already posted. Reddit thanks you for your service.
t1_dv14063	1	*	Free expression is valuable for a neutral, just society where people are not afraid to promote and advocate positions that the state refuses to accept.
t1_dv14l7m	0	*	In the context it is completely anti ISIS.  What a disingenuous argument.
t1_dv17a8g	0	*	Does one example come to mind? curious but would never go to that sub
t1_dv0nrwj	0	*	Nobody is arguing she didn't break the law. Stop strawmanning. The argument is that the law is terrible.
t1_dv1s6kk	1	*	If it's possible to do once with the current laws, it's possible to do every single day with current laws. The only reason it's not is because there aren't enough people who want to do it. 
t1_dv0y7uc	1	*	It was very clearly a rhetorical question. 
t1_dv27vhj	1	*	> unwarranted   I lol'd.
t1_dtulo2i	0	*	The boosters we're side by side. There's no way you're seeing one below the other. They hit the ground at exactly the same time. 
t1_dtwes3d	0	*	We're not talking about admiration. You compared Elon being the face of SpaceX to astronauts and I said that's a shitty comparison.
t1_dtus8mo	1	*	Did not know that! This changes my view on it then. 
t1_dtuwl6k	0	*	I made THIS.
t1_dtvfpvq	1	*	*viable for the elites. SpaceX is partially funded by gov't subsidies too. so happy my tax $ funds Elon's dick swinging and not universal healthcare.
t1_dtuxtzi	0	*	But in McGregor Texas that's a fortune compared to Silicone Valley. 
t1_dtum6nk	0	*	And what kind of propulsion do these sublight probes use?
t1_dtuvyo0	1	*	We can make a flying drone to film a floating drone. 
t1_dtuy7n9	0	*	None of what they are doing would be possible if it weren't for the Apollo program.
t1_dsj3c22	0	*	Okay Dmitri, whatever you say. I guess that means you care about the lives of random Americans just as much as you do your own and your familys.   Keep lying to yourself.
t1_dshr32w	1	*	Good choice. 
t1_dshzsny	1	*	You're clueless. No reason to respond.
t1_dshscp4	1	*	And forget killing goku!
t1_dshva89	1	*	And my axe!
t1_dshwbt5	0	*	Not to mention the chemical weapons Iraq supposedly had we had given to them to use on Iran as a proxy war.
t1_dsi03uy	1	*	The non-White kind
t1_dshoj3e	1	*	Yeah, exactly, but the distinction should still be made for the people reading the thread imo.
t1_dshstfv	1	*	Yup. 
t1_dsi8edv	0	*	Buhbuhbuhbwahbwahnananuh
t1_dshqgw1	1	*	Short term. Long term he is going to really hurt Russia

t1_dsi331a	1	*	Lmao. Thanks for the chuckle.
t1_dshqd33	1	*	I didn't say anything about its assertions.
t1_dsio0vh	0	*	No, i live in NS (which is pretty typical for russian emigrants in Serbia) :) I visited Kraljevo a couple of times but had no idea that there is a russian village nearby.
t1_dsi3kto	0	*	I mean even more than currently, like perhaps even become the dominant world power eventually.
t1_dshtqsv	1	*	thats what im finally understanding judging by how many times  whataboutism has been thrown around.  but yea, screw russia
t1_dshr0mk	0	*	It really is though. People try to put down living in America, but it it's really a lot better than most people in Reddit have to say. We're so spoiled we think we are living in horrible conditions.
t1_dshrd6c	1	*	But not the hookers
t1_dsibn9t	0	*	Tens of millions murdered for political opposition?  No?  Reread: you need to take a profound moral inventiory.
t1_dshz80n	1	*	Eh, forget the whole thing
t1_dsc8d31	1	*	Well then in that case it would be in their jurisdiction, but charges would still have to be filed.
t1_dt9lsyj	0	*	Im not sure what you think I'm claiming exactly. My point was abiogenesis has no bearing on evolution.
t1_dshs5h7	0	*	Is that goal? Overthrowing a dictator is different from overthrowing a democratic government, in that it wont happen.
t1_dsa4kim	1	*	Sure, but thats like saying smoking weed is the first step to sucking dick for heroin. The two are not equivocal. No one is dismantling the EU like you seem to want. 
t1_dsrlpjj	1	*	Yeah, clearly the solution here is more Muslims being influenced. Definitely. No way this could backfire.
t1_dsse8y5	0	*	The Westboro Baptists are assholes, but they don't go around killing people. You can ignore them and be fine.   It's not just christians who object to murdering children. 
t1_dssf3up	1	*	No matter what their intentions are, they are still held accountable for the fact that they committed suicide and that they killed other people. 
t1_dsssa4j	1	*	No.  I am absolutely saying they are different things.  People come before doctrine.  Doctrine is meaningless philosophizing if it doesn't represent the will and action of the people.
t1_dsscbtx	1	*	Maybe, maybe not. It's a long process and kids are impressionable i'd imagine this will need generations to fix.
t1_dtets24	0	*	Sure it does if it is declining it's obviously not being propagated. That makes no sense. 
t1_du6yunl	1	*	C'mon, just take the joke.
t1_du4bj7n	1	*	You want to make the same argument that government owns healthcare in the US because its heavily regulated?    And no, electricity transmission is not heavily regulated. 
t1_du476jl	1	*	Rocket science isn't civil engineering. You're comparing apples to rocks. 
t1_du4478z	0	*	Can you say rampant poverty and corruption?
t1_du6o122	1	*	You just call everyone idiots when you get called out, huh. You're a really shitty person.
t1_du438kr	1	*	So the dems can count on your support in the midterms? 
t1_du4esb7	0	*	As long as these uses are contained and dont risk human exposure, I dont see any issue with this.
t1_du44e9x	0	*	It's not glamorous is the problem. Talk a good game about maintaining infrastructure but its not as impressive as opening a new building or road or bridge. 
t1_du3zxi1	0	*	I was comparing it to a typical STATE that would be hit by a hurricane and be dealing with Federal assistance. If you can't grasp that, you're the one that needs to sit this one out.

t1_du47r8w	1	*	I see him and a former representative from my state Jack Kingston on the news a lot, horribly smug and they can't even properly argue their points. 
t1_du32sdn	0	*	I was never arguing the point of money vs accountabilty. Im just observing you were arguing within that discussion with an ad Hominem strategy.
t1_du4a450	0	*	And exactly as predicted, both videos are hosted by two different right-wing whackadoo conspiracy channels.   Your sources are worthless.
t1_du36p13	1	*	Yeah, I'm sure they are perfectly fine with the largest news network in the US, Fox News, calling Obama a commie muslim socialist whatever who is going to take away everyone's guns.
t1_dsedbog	0	*	Yes. It means I can be unbiased.  Edit: Hillary is scum, and Trump did not satisfy my ethical preconditions to be President. They're both awful.
t1_dujy41g	0	*	I didn't ask you to indrotuce yourself.
t1_ds4sm42	0	*	What? In that election, the choice was between a pedophile and a celebrated prosecutor who convincted KKK members. How is that anyway close to a Giant Douche/Turd Sandwich scenario?
t1_ds5vsiu	0	*	dude, youve demonstrated insane redefinition of reality and then a highly ignorant lie  there is no education possible in this thread, just condemnation and derision of your idiocy on the topic

t1_ds65rgq	0	*	How about none of It?
t1_ds4q8y6	0	*	Right... People in the US totally can't do something like vote for a competing party that already controls nearly half the legislature and had a president just 2 years ago...

t1_ds6108x	1	*	I don't know what to think anymore. One one hand this should be obvious satire, but then again this is Reddit. Plus you've got crazy person post history
t1_ds5akfh	0	*	Nah, not gonna do it.
t1_ds6vcd1	0	*	The video of him strong arming the owner was PLENTY of evidence demonstrating his shitty life choices, so I'll reserve my pity for someone who actually deserves it.
t1_ds4x6te	0	*	Re-read your comment
t1_ds4y8u9	0	*	lol, Occupy never provide a single source for any of their claims. You are like a climate change denier or the build the wall Trumpster.
t1_ds4y3fo	0	*	Yes, you can call me out haha that's not the point. Whataboutism is about finding dirt on others so a third party gets distracted on the fact that you are wrong.

t1_dtrp370	1	*	Is your way to win an argument just to insult people? 
t1_dtqw7fb	0	*	Yes, yes they are.. and I sympathize with their people. But, in this example, they tore down schools, dude. That's sorta a sketch thing to do. 
t1_ds3yyxa	1	*	Look at the FCC.
t1_ds412h9	0	*	Right, and if we cut ties with them it would totally either get better or stay the same, It couldn't possibly make things worse for US interest or for the stabilization of extremists.
t1_ds3epk2	0	*	Those, independently, were two claims pushed by the Obama Administration at different points in the process.   Again, your pedantry is only muddying the waters. You got the point.

t1_dt66zfm	0	*	The Dems are already a bunch of center-right neoliberals. Going left for them means agreeing that healthcare should be a right. They can't even fucking agree on that for fucks sake.
t1_dt69jq3	0	*	You're saying that the Republican congress established a special prosecutor to go after Clinton because they had knowledge of the future, wherein Clinton would perjur himself?

t1_dt65iwi	0	*	How flattering of you. Can't debate on merit, so you attack the person instead.
t1_dt5zgwh	1	*	Do you think the republicans would even see it as a red line at this point? With Nunes' shenanigans, I don't believe that. 
t1_dt63oob	0	*	Of course, I'm not saying we should do this and I don't think we should. I'm just saying that it would be very possible to create a system like that securely right now if a government wanted to.
t1_dt6csi8	1	*	And one side is putting some effort in while the other side is actively trying to make things worse.
t1_dt6l37q	0	*	Yes, our left is the rest of the worlds right.  We *hardly* have left wing representation.  Popular vote doesnt mean shit for presidential elections. Its not really something to focus on very much.

t1_dsv33mb	1	*	The State pays for the maternity leave through taxes, and reimburses the employer. The only thing the employer has to do is to find a temporary replacement for the employee.  
t1_dv4t90u	1	*	Didn't realize you like ISIS, Al Qaeda, Saddam Hussein, Assad, and dictatorships in general
t1_dv4ib2d	0	*	The main thing is he's not Canadian. Only Canadians are allowed to bitch about the fucking elephant south of the border.
t1_dv46m4p	1	*	> way more powerful, dangerous and ultimately destructive than any missiles.  Says the person that dismissed Russian trolling as three people on the internet.
t1_dv4n9g0	1	*	It was just repositioning within the new borders. This happened all across Eastern Europe, having Germans live within our borders proved dangerous, why risk it?

t1_dswyiam	0	*	Yeah. Love me some Milsurp from time to time.
t1_dswtrai	1	*	Not that help isn't an obligation to declare war on the aggressor. It could be as little as sending medical supplies.

t1_dsvqw6n	0	*	Yes, it's referred to as appeasement and history taught us it's best not to ignore a maniacal madman bent on imperial conquest. 
t1_dsvd0uq	1	*	A sensible, logical answer. Thank you. Although I dont think that Russia has the capacity to engage in a real war, I can see the validity in your points.

t1_dtt9is2	1	*	It would be fucking miraculous if Palestine was any more peaceful than it is.   How fuckin peaceful was Ireland in the 90s? The Palestinians have it far worse. 
t1_dtsmul1	1	*	China? They have.
t1_dtsithu	1	*	It happens
t1_dtsdwt1	0	*	The USA gives a negligible amount of money to the Palestinians and most of it goes towards enhancing Israeli security.

t1_dtt6xnb	0	*	Oh are we building straw men to win internet points? 
t1_ds48tf4	0	*	You think or you know? Both sides have stated, and even jointly declared the intention of unification multiple times. The biggest argument to this date is how?

t1_dt87mgt	1	*	I find that hard to believe unless the stolen property was extremely low value or the owner had no way of proving ownership.  
t1_dtczmd4	0	*	Even if that was true, and it's not, **they would still have just as much right to live there as the Israelis do.**
t1_duwh6me	1	*	Because someone claiming something as true should have the burden of proof, not the audience he's claiming it to. Seems like common sense?

t1_ds8jnho	0	*	Believe whatever you want. I never imagined I would change any minds. People generally are going to believe whatever they want/hope to be true. You seem no different. 
t1_ds8xxlv	0	*	Do you have a question that isn't moronic? 
t1_dsa9can	0	*	So why has Trump fired so many over undisclosed ties to Russians?  Why has Mueller arrested two so far if no evidence has been found. 
t1_dt0lac7	0	*	I know and that's why an excessive amount of regulation backfires.  Better keep regulations to an absolute essential minimum.  
t1_dtqa39w	0	*	It literally says Fox News on the corner of the screen the entire time Hannity is speaking. He's masquerading as news.

t1_dswptnp	1	*	A true Canadian debate.
t1_dswsipp	0	*	It is not arbitrary though, and the laws that the government enact must pass a examination before the court. You should read up on this before making these assumptions.

t1_dswp03g	1	*	/u/thedrivingcat is agreeing with you that the abortion issue isn't settled.   It is /u/YachiruTheKittyKat's comment about things never being settled in a democracy that people are taking issue with.

t1_dswjiyr	1	*	Pretty sure that is animal abuse so that right would infringe on existing rights. 
t1_dsxce2i	1	*	That's a different argument.
t1_dswpk2w	0	*	I think it signifies a misunderstanding of the situation at hand. You cant force someone to do something, and then take no responsibility for the repercussions

t1_ds6fvu9	1	*	Then why would we ever decide to stop Brexit if doing so will be worse than leaving?  Are you just making this up as you go along? It seems like you are.
t1_ds6gpa7	1	*	Even if it was possible, why would the EU sanction a country for choosing to stay in the union? That would be extremely counter-productive.

t1_ds878m3	0	*	To feel pain you need pain receptors and nerve system. Plants have neither. 
t1_duw6mzt	1	*	How do you know I didn't? 
t1_duw5706	1	*	Sure, but not like Im ruining peoples lives by selling them heroin fucked up.
t1_duxm77h	0	*	How predictable. 
t1_ds34vjl	0	*	It's called being two different countries. 
t1_duc15hn	1	*	Lots of Chinese citizens would be happy to live in one of these prisons.
t1_dt0uj2k	0	*	If you think he doesn't care about being removed as CEO and his company's sales tanking, you're delusional.
t1_dszluhx	0	*	His political activities would indicate otherwise.
t1_dt0gj9x	0	*	Yeah it's pricy in the US too.  I can get the same pizza for $5 less from Domino's or Pizza Hutt and it tastes better.    Never got what the jalepeno was for, feels like no one wants it/uses it.
t1_dszmnyb	1	*	Yeah. Nobody wants to be identified as a racist or racist-ally. But he totally has control over his public image, just not as much as hed like (obviously).
t1_dszfezg	0	*	Haha. 
t1_dsr4atq	1	*	Cool I am glad :) have a good night! 
t1_dshn7cm	0	*	I suggest you read the entry on Somaliland and the reason for it breaking away from Somalia. You may just learn something.
t1_dsjk2le	0	*	Im firmly middle class but the number of people in poverty as a percent of population is actually pretty close between US and NL. It sucks no matter what side of the pond youre on.
t1_dsjazzf	1	*	Yeah, most of the country is annoyed. We don't like being governed by a dementia rattled old man who tweets like a 15 year old neckbeard with too much to prove.
t1_dsjozm5	1	*	Then it becomes status quo and you win. 
t1_dsjcxh0	1	*	You must be the best hypothetical parent in the world.
t1_dsjl8qz	0	*	You can read and speak English right? Have you read the link you posted? It doesn't support what you're saying at all. 
t1_dsj88nv	0	*	I don't think gerrymandered districts have anything to do with the electoral college.

t1_dsjqd2t	1	*	That voting system is a feature, not a flaw. There's also mounds of evidence for rampant election fraud and virtually all calls for investigation fall on deaf ears.
t1_dsjkv44	1	*	I don't disagree, but if we remained a republic, he would have been Stadtholder, which is a way cooler title. 
t1_dsjch18	1	*	Power attracts the ones who are already corrupt. Those pedophile priests aren't becoming pedophiles all of a sudden once they are priests.
t1_dsjhvsx	0	*	This might be a bit of a generalization dont you think. How do you feel about guys like Thomas Sowell and Jason Riley?
t1_dsk4flv	0	*	>  areas in Sweden with high crime rates has nothing to do with the refugee population  What statistics are you basing that on?
t1_dsj7qk0	0	*	change has to start from somewhere bud
t1_dslatn3	0	*	Okay mr.troll. Whatever you say.
t1_dsjj0lr	1	*	Fair enough
t1_dsj8xzh	0	*	Not ethnic Russians, the state of Russia. That's like confusing it's the Israeli (government) with it's the jews. Don't be an uninformed cunt just for internet points.
t1_dsjfdq2	1	*	That game is Dark Souls 2 isnt it
t1_dsjau51	1	*	Nevermind reddit doesnt believe in legal process. I guess the only people who should have guns are the murderous police and trumps government. Genius. 
t1_dsm0qb1	1	*	I always feel happy when I see outrage over trivial shit because yes, that does mean we are doing very well indeed.
t1_dsjlb00	0	*	Man, the rampant nationalism among the Dutch is hard to get through. Its just a perfect nation that operates without a hint of typical human behavior. 
t1_duiavaz	1	*	You absolutely do... you were wrong
t1_dsji4x7	0	*	Youd have to be a specific type of person to be driven to insults in two posts now on incredulity alone

t1_dsjdhdo	0	*	establishment corruption and you support Trump is who corrupt as they come.  Have a good day man
t1_dsk02le	1	*	ahh ok, I thought it was an agreement with the Netherlands which would have made no sense.
t1_dsjjjdm	1	*	You voted for trump because you are against corruption? ... that seams contra produktive.
t1_dsjeyvs	0	*	I am not a fan of Wilders but I do think he is smarter than Trump. 
t1_dsjbhv6	1	*	Thanks, glad you agree. 
t1_dsj98pu	1	*	I mean he fucking won. I don't feel too good about it but I won't spend a year crying over it. He...Won. And the reasons why he won are still apparently mystifying some. 
t1_dsj8wh9	0	*	It's normally a good product but we've discovered some bugs that should be patched out in phases starting later this year and in 2020.
t1_dsjjdji	1	*	How many of those four have accused any non-majority group of wholesale property damage and/or murder?  What did Hillary do?
t1_dsjfsfn	0	*	Dude, I'm going through the same process right now of emotional progress. Its hard actually letting yourself feel sometimes.
t1_dskctom	1	*	Word. A bright point in our titling history.
t1_dsjekzk	0	*	Trump literally can't visit the UK right now it's so bad. I don't think you understand how little respect the rest of the world has for him. 
t1_dsj7o87	1	*	Anyone who thinks it still is must be smoking something fun.
t1_dsjto94	1	*	NSA actually does spy on everyone. I didn't make up that quote. It's context is that the CIA is in Hollywood and media 
t1_dsjn5ap	1	*	No more than than the usual amount of radioactivity. So yes.
t1_dsjgjhb	0	*	Oh absolutely.  That makes perfect sense.  
t1_dsjs1nu	0	*	Quite clearly an Ameriboo though. Keep sucking their dicks, it might get you somewhere.
t1_dsjd3as	0	*	Good point. Then we can make a nice Stamppot That Guy.
t1_dsjfl1l	1	*	Alright, that's fair enough.
t1_dsja3i4	1	*	Well it's certainly better than a bunch of places, but also not the best. 
t1_dt3o9e9	0	*	What does de-colonisation mean in this context? Maybe we're lost in translation. I'm assuming you mean pushing whites to leave?
t1_dt1xghj	1	*	Bru there are some old white dudes and there are some racists but the definitely are a whole lot of good people and logical people that only care for the country.
t1_dt5pmev	1	*	No, because he didn't read it. 
t1_ds8bx5s	1	*	True.
t1_ds7id2l	1	*	It doesn't bother me at all, I just found it interesting.  That's why I travel, to see how other people do things!  :-)
t1_ds7jc7n	0	*	Apparently young Asians smoke to be like their American movie heroes, but in real life, Americans have one of the worlds lowest smoking rates. 
t1_du0a2p7	0	*	You know what, you're right lol. I guess I kinda jumped to point out what I thought was ignorance when it was actually just you trying to make a point about ad hominem, I apologize
t1_du05c21	1	*	Anything can be political if you look at it right? /s
t1_du07rdr	1	*	Thxxx girls are the gayest so i thought it would be a good diss 
t1_du0c1q2	1	*	how much is it in Schrute bucks?
t1_du0bfs3	0	*	Another great bit about Gitmo is that Obama and Hillary both supported it. So in that argument, they're Nazis too.   It sucks that humans crave adversity, but look for such unhealthy outlets. 
t1_dt3y2s2	1	*	thanks :)
t1_dtd6faf	0	*	If everyone changed their ways it would have an effect.  Do you really not get that?  Start at home before being a self-righteous asshole.

t1_dsoqzub	0	*	Because I am not an indoctrinated Lefty it doesn't take any gymnastics at all for me to be happy with that.
t1_dsppgc7	0	*	Ah yes the party of its their fault not mine 
t1_dsqdn2k	1	*	What is its flag? Founding document? Borders? Currency? On what date did it become a nation? Who makes up the government of Palestine? Who is the leader?
t1_dsp5dti	0	*	I'm not assuming that at all, the opposite is plainly true and I'm marvelling at it
t1_dsp9451	0	*	hmm yes donations. not forced taxes that all americans have to pay.
t1_dsoow0d	0	*	No its not...  percent of GDP yield has no bearing on the cost of the problem. You are certainly good at finding ways to denigrate the US in your argument, but you just look like a clown. 
t1_dsqfcmi	0	*	So you never wanted to discuss policy and expected others to discuss it with you? Is this some reused trolling strategy from The_Dotard? Smells of stable genius.
t1_dtsqynm	0	*	Why not send all refugees to Europe make some popcorn and see the holocost 2.0
t1_dv571m5	1	*	Lol it's a v6
t1_dv3x8vw	0	*	Nobody forced them to take the job
t1_duroi3x	1	*	Counterpoint. We watch American news so we are less informed than the rest of the world.

t1_durrkt8	0	*	Yeah, of course, minus a couple of world wars sure.
t1_durnjw6	0	*	No, that one is actually true. Mostly it's rape though. Doesn't get reported past maybe national news. 
t1_durd2vv	0	*	Sorry if I came across hostile. Realised you were just stating their opinion.
t1_dusp3kg	1	*	Yes, we are saying the exact same thing aren't we?
t1_durj8ot	0	*	If by fluke you mean suppported by foreign countries, sure.
t1_durqkds	1	*	Not really.
t1_durt71b	0	*	Grow up. Youre going to find there are many people in the world who dont interpret events as you do. 
t1_durr4pt	1	*	To be fair you probably understand more about brexit than most people who voted for brexit
t1_durr5bd	0	*	I'm an American, but the first thing they'd tell you is to stop having such a retarded 2 party system...  Bit like telling the slow kid in class to stop eating paste. 
t1_durvbw6	0	*	Yeah I was also impressed - I thought it would be less than half that distance to be honest.
t1_durxiu4	0	*	he says in a thread related to Aussie politician not 'offering advice' to trump, as if anybody in the world thinks trump would take such advice in the first place lol
t1_duc5ag4	0	*	Well yea it does and I'm okay with that, but when people say Jews are rediculous it kinda pisses me off

t1_duzbwtk	1	*	Haha
t1_dt1uzus	0	*	You're right. We should let the government tell people what they can and can't do. We should also enable the cartels! Man, why don't more people think like you?

t1_ds57cvf	1	*	He has a rough idea.

t1_dui14n5	0	*	A lot of hard working kids knew where their hard earned money went.
t1_dui4q91	1	*	Pretty close to dead on. I would argue that a rare skillset is not truly necessary, as long as your skillset is in demand and not subject to automation for a few decades.
t1_dujaovq	1	*	Yes. I don't know anything about hardship and all my opinions are based on biased assumptions.
t1_dui3jz0	0	*	Which again is an opinion.  
t1_dui3494	1	*	except landlords and real estate developers.  The real winners

t1_dui8xw1	1	*	He's not saying unemployed Greeks are just being irresponsible, he's saying they're having a good time.   Hanging out and picking up women doesn't have a negative connotation (most of the time).

t1_duibs13	0	*	Not if the interest rates keep rising, and it seems to be going that way
t1_dujf28n	0	*	You have no fucking clue of what Italy's economic problems are, they existed way before the Euro, same for Greece, the hit to these economies was to be expected.
t1_dui113r	1	*	Combine this with a few wealthy oligarchs and automation and you have a recipe for disaster.

t1_dtup3bh	1	*	My mistake, I assumed that someone who defended Irans state run media offering rewards for the mister of an acclaimed author was going to also defend the rest of disgusting things Iran does openly.
t1_dtswt4w	1	*	Ever heard the phrase its like comparing apples to orange?
t1_dtt6bp7	0	*	[stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) for one. from what i understand, someone had to physically upload this virus in iran.
t1_dtzbpi0	0	*	I read it already...and it mentions the ban on christian signs.  FYI I was in school in France and even if small crosses as well as small veils are allowed, the real ban is about ostentatious signs.
t1_dttriqf	0	*	The article I linked to is the subject, women did die. Women die in Islam protesting the head scarf all the time. Why are you dismissive of it? 
t1_du320rq	1	*	I didn't offer anything. The seller did. I offered the asking price. Sometimes retail is weird.
t1_du52pyz	0	*	They said the memo is not accurate. So yes, they did say it's false. Inaccurate is a synonym of false.
t1_dspnosc	0	*	still no proof/source of the stats.  im gonna call bullshit on this.  so stop trying to pull facts out of your collective asses.

t1_dsvxr4v	1	*	>friend  :D
t1_dtk7xf9	1	*	No, this is not anti-us propaganda. This is just a question of the motivations for various actions on the part of nations in the past.

t1_dsfcegn	1	*	I like one or two Senators. I'm not really sure about one of them.
t1_dsex51o	1	*	Eh, they could just lie their asses off like Oliver North did. If they get caught in perjury he can just pardon them for that too.
t1_dsefgi1	1	*	Would plummet further since he is the jackass starting the fight.
t1_dses86x	0	*	The place where this is wrong is that impeachment hearings can technically be begun for any reason. They are a political process and not a judicial one, so a crime doesn't have to have been committed.

t1_dttaigw	0	*	Fine, then it was a deflection.  It's still whataboutism. Trump is doing X! Well, what about Hillary?!.
t1_dtt2113	0	*	Do you always resort to ad hominems? That's the second one in two replies.    So I guess we're done here. 
t1_dttsz1u	1	*	I've seen many qualified people with a speaking level above Trump's fail the CPE multiple times.  That said, someone with Trump's money will likely have no issues.

t1_ds7ymci	1	*	8000 year old? 
t1_ds7po42	0	*	Trump has helped bring so much savings to American s and to certain industries into the multibillions. 46 million is small compared to that. Look that shit up on politifact
t1_ds7qgxv	1	*	Right and again, lucrative alone isn't the only concern. Overall energy use matters, too, and by exporting a lot we are obviously using a ton of energy (rather than using it mostly at home)
t1_ds8646h	0	*	Ok, what about our planet instead?
t1_ds7mat9	1	*	Yes, objectively it does.

t1_duz5saq	0	*	That'd be up to the government.
t1_duy85s2	1	*	You said owning gun doesn't help yet the US fell in deep shit in Iraq, so clearly having gun helped against tanks, drones and bombing. 
t1_duzlglg	1	*	Wouldnt the time for that have been about 100 years ago when semi autos started being common? Or have they not been an issue this entire time?
t1_duzh79j	1	*	A specific type of semi auto rifle. Outright banning semi auto rimfire squirrel rifles, hunting/clays shotguns, hunting rifles, etc seems way overboard of a response.
t1_duytf6p	1	*	I never assume you were. I just pointed out who the Finnish people should look to if they're dissatisfied.
t1_duz4cko	1	*	It didn't end well, but it had a severe and lasting impact on the way blacks were treated.  There was a lot of merit to the movement to police the police (as we can still see today). 
t1_duy6th8	1	*	I dont see it as that, and we dont have a vermin problem.  Hell I fly all the way to Turkey every summer to shoot their vermin. I dont use a semi there either.

t1_dst4f95	1	*	Hey! Last summer wasn't great... and December wasn't brilliant... but we had a few bright sunny days early in winter!
t1_dssi3sh	1	*	The houses here are made for the cold with a decent amount of insolation. Also most all houses have heaters, which is why Canada has such a high energy consumption per capita.
t1_dssqllu	1	*	Its probably because when its bright and sunny, it gets hot as balls, even in cold months.  Except right now, Im freezing my balls off in Houston 
t1_dst894h	0	*	And, for no reason at all, I shall inform you that -40C and -40F is the same.

t1_dso0v52	0	*	ehhh were in luck and only about 1/3 of the country is delusional enough to support this president, mainly because at this point, there's nothing he can do to lose their support.
t1_dsnyjmj	0	*	Honestly if someone taking away the option to buy fucking assault rifles is at the forefront of your priorities list then you need to rethink your life mate. 
t1_dsoicb7	0	*	A ramp just makes a heavy barrel feel heavier. They used pulleys and a wooden elevator system most likely.
t1_dsnwekq	0	*	They were talking about admiring Hitler.  The cultural identity politics of his time are going to be more relevant than present ones.
t1_dsoq1da	0	*	How am I even being binary there, I'm pointing out one similarity between two distinct groups. I never said they were exactly the same, I said they used similar logic in this situation.
t1_dsnvju1	1	*	Oh they are here on Reddit too.  Dropping redpills in threads.  All they need is just one gullible person every few days to buy the their bullshit to keep it going.

t1_dsokqjs	1	*	Haiti
t1_dso4egn	1	*	No i don't think they will achieve anything in this life but that's besides the point. I just call out assholes and nazis if i see them because they deserve to be called out!
t1_dsns4q3	1	*	Those are clearly giants.
t1_dso4g32	0	*	It's incredibly fucked up, I completely agree.  I really, really, really, really wish I could be surprised, but unfortunately I can't be. 
t1_dsoehod	0	*	Thanks for stalking my comment history  I plan on hopefully coming to live in America eventually... Though in all likelihood, given my chosen career i'll be living in a blue state.
t1_dsnupcu	0	*	He said you have a lack of self awareness. Are you really that fragile that you can only respond by saying it's an 'ad-hominem' fallacy?
t1_dsnwe3l	0	*	allegedly...
t1_dso2uro	0	*	Yes, you have provided one incident. Good show. But since I have asked for incidents plural, you have also failed while succeeding. Typical of the Trump camp. 
t1_dso2l3g	1	*	No, I'm pretty sure people just take those for fun.
t1_dso3xw1	0	*	Oh I totally got that. But traveling being somehow distinct from driving is one I hadn't heard before.
t1_dsp9w4b	1	*	It's good but I still prefer Mock The Week.
t1_dsojak5	1	*	Lol
t1_dso61vo	1	*	And, by extension, onions. 
t1_dsodb0k	1	*	Why would anyone in a 600 mile radius ever need to talk about our constitution? Maybe theyd need to speak avout individual laws and such but never the entirety of them.
t1_dsnwbqn	1	*	Nice job on that officer for handling that well. And holy crap is that lady sad.
t1_dspooqh	1	*	Im a sheep because I believe in climate change? Idiot.
t1_dsnx5ys	0	*	This is just a whole new level of wtf. These people are crazy! Thanks, that's today's rabbit hole.
t1_dsnxymr	1	*	I've not watched it in years, it used to be hilarious viewing back in the early 00's. Back when BBC2 was known for its quality TV. 
t1_dsnwffw	1	*	>They have, um, all of the rights of a U.S. citizen without following any of their laws.  > ... Well that would just be pure anarchy.  Holy. shit. that's. hilarious.  He was so calm and patient.
t1_dsnz26z	1	*	Why doesn't the US refer to Asian as Chinese Korean etc, 
t1_dsoaquo	0	*	Lol.  Really?  You know we have cameras right?  We can see these retarded, anti-free speech leftists.  
t1_dso3e1p	1	*	Why are we capitalizing condescending?
t1_dt4pydw	0	*	Art of War is just as relevant today as it was some 2,300 years ago. Sun Tzu will never be played out.
t1_dsjtifr	1	*	In other words...  like saying most brits are anglican or most swedes are lutheran? Okay. Bye.
t1_dv6mnr4	1	*	No, they are just starving them all to death or just shooting them outright.  Price fixing don't look so bad by comparison!
t1_dteha7i	0	*	The fact is that you're both bringing up communists for absolutely no reason.  [Almost like you're trying to change the subject or something.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)  
t1_dtehej9	0	*	Just admit you're brigading
t1_dtfwfsi	1	*	ohhh concede the dont, i just end up leaving.

t1_dtf6m18	0	*	Nah. 
t1_dtfpxeu	0	*	He's literally on video twice talking about dating and having sex with his daughter, and saying grab em by the pussy. Those are hard facts my friend. I believe facts.
t1_dtf0bb9	1	*	No, you try this shit with me and it instantly turns me off.    Unless it's beer.  You can probably talk me into buying any beer this way.
t1_dsids9e	1	*	I would love to visit one day. Wherever I go, the first thing on my mind is trying local cuisine.  
t1_du54ar8	1	*	> lacking in substance  Look in the mirror, man.

t1_dsxgtza	0	*	Yeah, I probably should have phrased that better. 
t1_dsx5ivd	0	*	>over every single other thing that *matters*  That's pretty subjective. Yeah, some people think humans matter more than everything else. What's your point?
t1_dsxac6s	1	*	Yup same in Wisconsin. Outside the few cities life wouldnt be that much different for some. *Grew up on a farm in rural northeast Wisconsin. 
t1_dsva2qs	1	*	once again, every country does this

t1_dv4ef9q	1	*	Most dont drink bourbon much anyway. Whiskey etc.
t1_dv45gie	1	*	No matter what Mueller finds, not even he can force impeachment. The Republican congress *owns* this clusterfuck every single day that they allow it to continue.
t1_duu12ey	1	*	Even worse than glitter 
t1_duul8gs	1	*	At least tens of hundreds!
t1_duu3xvj	0	*	So you're act like them because you hate the way they act?

t1_ds2ub5g	0	*	how do memes get dated no seriously.
t1_ds2o9nw	0	*	Can't or shouldn't? We all know that Trump doesn't care about doing or saying things that he shouldn't, and even in some cases can't.
t1_ds2xc24	1	*	Gross negligence is straight from the criminal statute.   Had he said gross negligence he would have to recommend indictment.   Thus why it's important.
t1_ds380hr	1	*	BIG SHAQ
t1_ds32och	1	*	You're right, collusion itself isn't a crime but conspiracy against the United States IS.
t1_dsk1gqk	0	*	What has he done wrong exactly?  Nothing that's been proven.  So what the fuck are you even going on about. 
t1_dtjj9z7	1	*	That's rather ominous 
t1_dsnnz7b	1	*	Oh, you're drunk for the weekend. Ok then.
t1_dsn86hx	0	*	It's not about you, it's about us. Criminals rejoin society.

t1_dt45x41	0	*	Europe is a bit different because of the EU and the free movement that allows. I'm not knowledgeable enough to go into any more detail than that though. 
t1_dt3tq89	1	*	That too. I was thinking about the ethics of if a government should be able to exist for one, and second, be able to control migration. 
t1_dt500t9	0	*	If anything, the palestinians are the land grabbers. They're originally from arabia, the jews are originally from judea.
t1_dt47vib	0	*	Which section did I misunderstand? Enlighten me, please
t1_dt5l32h	0	*	Yes, which is why there have been quite a few Islamic terrorist attacks in England, obviously caused by moderate Islamists. Let's not forget the Sharia law courts. 
t1_dt3eqwv	0	*	Youre making sense until the genocide part. Nazi Germany literally tried to wipe out the Jewish race in Europe. To say other countries committed genocide by fighting the war, well thats just ignorant.
t1_dt5e5lv	0	*	How many refugees turn out to be economic migrants?
t1_dt3tkjd	1	*	Honestly though, at lease they accept refugees. Politicians here(Malaysia) and Indonesia talk big about the abuse the rohingya receive(typical pandering for muslim votes) but dont want to accept them.
t1_duweujh	0	*	Bumblediddy, GA isn't, but Bumblediddy in any state isn't likely to be an LGBT paradise.  Atlanta, OTOH, is actually one of the better cities for LGBT.  
t1_ds6e0cg	0	*	Good thing is you get to decide that for yourself, not some other asshole.
t1_ds6jt0h	1	*	But some daring capitalist created that job, so we should thank them!
t1_ds6d889	1	*	That's not what I'm debating. I don't think jokes should be illegal speech at all.  I'm just pointing out that saying it is benign is complete bullshit.
t1_ds6h07y	0	*	This is the best analogy I've read in terms of having an effect on my thinking. This is a great point

t1_ds6g14t	1	*	Newspapers aren't private property?
t1_ds6f8nr	1	*	There is no free speech outside of the US. I wish I'd be there already, these European attitudes make me sick.

t1_ds6hd73	0	*	>A place that tells you what you want to hear will sell more of their product.  Marketing 101, and I don't think FB is an echo chamber by any means. 
t1_ds6kymo	1	*	Cannn doooo!
t1_ds6u1qy	1	*	Which people should have to suffer because we somehow think that the opinions of nazis and racists and homophobes are worth more than human lives? Conveniently all the minorities you aren't?
t1_ds78gnd	1	*	I believe they prefer to be called satirrorist 
t1_ds6cfb8	1	*	> ecause Germany defines it as even pretty benign criticism of their migrant policy.  No it does not.
t1_ds6g99h	1	*	Yeah that's what I'm saying, they are everywhere now.    Like roaches
t1_ds9pj2s	1	*	That's the thing, every argument against workers democracy always seems to just be an argument against democracy itself. 
t1_ds6s2mx	0	*	But I swear it was in Comic Sans
t1_ds6r99f	0	*	The entire Democratic party is full of left leaning globalist capitalists.
t1_ds6hkyp	1	*	Well my point was simply that when you said that they have no duty, it seemed like a definitive statement, even though what duties they have is up to the laws of each country to define.
t1_ds6jtm5	0	*	The private company (facebook) is allowed to prefer users over other users. 
t1_ds7ihh6	0	*	That's whataboutism still. We aren't talking about ISPs we are talking about services like FB and YT
t1_ds6bw96	1	*	The issue is people don't know whether you were referring to something they possibly haven't seen or heard. Which anyone who is not a moron knows that is not an unreasonable assumption to make.

t1_du9ma67	0	*	You acknowledge that she was defending herself?
t1_dtv7mtb	1	*	It wasn't a lot of money. It was basically chump change for the US. And it was a investment,  not a give away. 
t1_dtw23wf	0	*	So do EU citizens
t1_dtvkodh	1	*	You clearly don't know. Because all you read is stuff about climate change, safe spaces and the fact there actually 71 different genders.  All the important stuff lol
t1_dtx4zul	1	*	If you can't read and then comprehend what people are saying I can't help you.
t1_dtvcsfa	0	*	Republicans could have reauthorized CHIP literally any time on its own. They CHOSE to use it as a hostage for budget negotiations.

t1_dtv9z4m	0	*	> The most influential union in the world just lost its globally most influential partner  So you admit America is merely our partner. We still got Asia.

t1_dtvhkla	0	*	> Is that a fair statement?  Yes, it is.  Belonging to an ethnicity or religion is neither positive nor negative, it is neutral.
t1_dsrw18z	0	*	So does Russia. Your kingdom's opinion is irrelevant in this case, just like Russian opinion about Ireland.
t1_dsux1no	0	*	Bernie Sanders was better than the Australian Labor Party option. It may be Elizabeth Warren next time in the primaries and she is very similar to Bernie.
t1_dtqmllg	0	*	No it doesn't, like not even remotely.
t1_dukc6v3	1	*	Ok. Lets just give the government the ok to fuck the world up more.   Our military hasnt been fighting for a real tangible cause since WW2, maybe Korea if youre generous.

t1_dv0t1r7	0	*	We do have trot, jog, and skip. Also no one is making up a new word. The example we're referring to is 'reverse racism' which is using 'adjectives or adverbs' just as you suggest right?

t1_dv1d1ec	1	*	My family and I have committed no sins.   The reason you have guilt is because you know that you and yours are guilty. Don't drag others in with you.

t1_dv03r2b	0	*	Sins of the father, huh? How very biblical of you. It doesn't matter how long ago the events were; this course of action is going to lead to mass death, and your support of it is unconscionable.
t1_dv047ws	1	*	Thanks! I appreciate it.

t1_dv0iy2l	0	*	If it was such a barren wasteland, why did Europeans decide to colonize it? Waste of time and money to invade a land that is useless and barren.
t1_dv02ucr	1	*	I'm not wrong, go read the other comments I made which are backed up by facts.
t1_dv02kpx	0	*	After reading the comments here, I just gotta ask: What the fuck is your problem?  Someone disagrees with what you perceive to be the bigger threat so you have to act like an asshole? 
t1_dv05kuq	1	*	That kinda is how civilisation works. Especially when they improve the area.
t1_duzzq9x	0	*	Its pretty simple though. If you hate a race because of what other unrelated people did thats racism. If you hate specific people in that race because of what they did its ok and not racism. 
t1_duzzgmd	1	*	Ah, my bad I apologize then. Yeah, I can't stand that line of thinking they make. It's insulting.   Sorry again. 
t1_dv0g20u	0	*	Well yes, but how are you going to buy food and water with no money?

t1_dv075ta	0	*	So an Irishman who moves to America can't call himself an Irish-American because there are Americans that have shamrock tablecloths already?  He should call himself an American with Irish heritage?

t1_dv045uw	1	*	Who where most likely raised in said countries and therefore assimilated to that culture.
t1_dv005sw	0	*	I know a few South Africans & they are pretty racist towards black people. I guess the race issues just never healed.
t1_dt7hwu2	1	*	Cus its using the Chinese character version of the words. If you use the literal Korean translations ubaa9(mok ) =ub098ubb34(nahmoo)=wood/tree and ub9c8(mah )=ub9d0(mahL)=horse
t1_dt7boxv	1	*	Who wouldn't?
t1_dt7kfkk	0	*	So let me put it like this.  How do you think the 19th century would have shaped up for the British Empire if they were able to retain their hold on the American colonies?  
t1_dt7ck18	0	*	Fair point. But then with no consequences I wonder if we're incentivizing future despots to go for it. 
t1_dt7s9gd	0	*	Cant even spell it right.
t1_dt7aenk	1	*	Sure, but an adult North Korean probably has a much lower peak strength than a South Korean does.  They can't suddenly grow a few feet if they're adults.

t1_dt7e5mw	0	*	Yea we don't need that. War is dumb. Speaking from experience of course. (OIF 9-10)
t1_dt7e0dz	1	*	Oh forget about it. I remember the first time I went to a show at Club 9:30. I was like damn. I better not venture far from the venue...
t1_dt9jbsk	0	*	Kinda yeah. They're not a great group, but the Chinese gov't rounds them up and kills them.
t1_dt7vuh8	1	*	Oh good. I missed your meaning. 
t1_dt7jv33	1	*	Casting aside any ethical issues, having half of a country treated as a cheap labor source will create a lot of resentment.

t1_dt7ibpi	1	*	Yeah no, Texas schools taught this stuff when I was there in the late 90s/early 2000s. We learned about the various native tribes in the area and across america. 
t1_dt7al25	0	*	I've seen Germany used a lot in this thread, but lots of people are saying Germany and Korea aren't comparable, and I agree. 
t1_dt73ebj	1	*	Bring them democracy but not really 
t1_dt7cyc1	0	*	It would be worse than the unification of Germany, but it's not necessarily going to be a disaster, especially since America would pour billions of aid to stabilize Unified Korea
t1_dt8vfts	1	*	Oh cool, not cricket at all!
t1_dt88q55	0	*	Was the war against Hitler justified? Would it have been justified to kill the Nazis in Germany before they rise to power?

t1_dt7xnd5	0	*	Agreed, for the PEOPLE! 
t1_dt8jvum	1	*	I live in what I would call a rural town. We have about 80,000 people in a 400 sq mile(1036 sq km) area. I have to drive like 120 km to get to an actual city with a population bigger than 100,000.

t1_dt7ujq0	1	*	Since nowhere is perfect we shouldn't even try, right?
t1_dt7p4c1	1	*	Completely agree. As a HK citizen, I must say that maintaining our culture is the crux of the whole debate -- most realize that we couldn't exist without Chinese resources and help.

t1_dtbp0n2	0	*	Don't forget that even the reputable lenders did not do any due diligence, because they could sell off the mortgage to another bank before any fraud came to light.

t1_dsq6q7o	0	*	That is how a leader works.  The day after the election when dems were literally rioting in the streets, he effectively ended TPP, that alone moved him out ahead of Obama.

t1_dso0ffn	1	*	Simply put, no. Two different principles and two different supporting documents.  Comparing guns to taxes is not a valid comparison.

t1_dunx214	0	*	Here in Arkansas, it's a plastic cup for large sodas, styrofoam for large teas, and everything else is a waxed paper cup. How common is it for someone to order a large drink there?
t1_dunu0z4	0	*	I've found it varies by location. The McDonalds by my office in Huntsville gives out styrofoam cups, but the one by my apartment gives out plastic cups. Im in Mobile for work and its been all plastic.

t1_dtrlpa1	1	*	Yeah, and there's a Moscow in Idaho. Doesn't mean that it's russian.
t1_dspiges	1	*	Well the reason at the time of invasion was WMDs which of course we all know how that turned out.   In retrospect it was tried to make it into a free the Iraqi people operation.

t1_dunztmd	0	*	Are you under the impression that you can walk into a store and buy a gun without an I'd?
t1_dunvg8g	0	*	Many drugs are illegal in the US, but they're very easy to obtain. Just because you make something illegal, doesn't mean people aren't going to obtain it via black market

t1_dtiwee9	1	*	Strictly speaking, the US is very good at conventional warfare, they like everyone else are just bad at handling unconventional methods like terrorism and guerrilla's.
t1_dtie8xu	0	*	Good thing President Trump got the price reduced from billions to millions, more than any other president has done to reduce cost and actually do something about it

t1_dtirtr7	1	*	It is terrible, I just wish people would stop sourcelessly saying that the US government didn't do anything when a quick google search reveals otherwise.
t1_dtkizzr	1	*	Wtf are you on about? At no point did I agree with the idea of throwing people into a camp just  because their political stance is different from mine 
t1_dtjfhyu	1	*	Oh no, I want this place closed. Its a sick and twisted facility. But I think theres some expert level bullshittery going on for it to cost Eighty Million Dollars To close it down
t1_dtitq8v	1	*	I havent slept for 10 days... because that would be too long. 
t1_dtio7sg	0	*	You literally started out the rational discourse with a deliberate misquote/misrepresentation of his point. You had no intent of having any kind of debate. You're full of shit. 
t1_dtiljiq	1	*	This simply just isn't true. Junkies can regularly stay up for weeks to a month without any sleep. I doubt they're even micro-sleeping since it's drug induced.
t1_dtinzpl	1	*	Nonsense, Trump is the picture of health. His doctor says so. He's so healthy, he even grew an inch taller!

t1_dtikeuj	1	*	Thanks for the laughs

t1_dtijlzn	0	*	The war is not over
t1_dtiby3w	1	*	Yes, on principle. However, international law recognizes the US as having legal control of the property.   And Cuba *did* cash one check in 1959... on accident. 
t1_dtilldl	0	*	I guess so. You'd think that instead of arguing without knowing anything about the topic at hand you'd just go read the wiki page on it though.

t1_ds8oshc	1	*	Funny as in Gucci + McQueen--both silly chihuahua mixes named after clothing designers. But yeah, the rest was fucked up for sure
t1_ds8frq3	0	*	That's not true at all. Ethics can never be inherently wrong. There is no truth involved.

t1_dtjg8v5	0	*	What evidence do you have to support any of these claims.
t1_dtjdsjr	0	*	Exactly, and so would a lot of homeless. So lets stop pretending the issue here is they are homeless. The issue is, they want free money and they dont want to work for it. 
t1_dtjco1a	1	*	That's how a large number of them because homeless.
t1_dtjdv2j	0	*	Ok some might, but most dont. And deciding not to take action to help end homlessness because *some* are okay with it just feels like an excuse to be apathetic.

t1_dtj2v8u	0	*	Well yes really. I do want better civilisation, and as you know the numbers of homeless has increased in the last few years. That's embarrassing for a 1st world country.

t1_ds1tj0x	1	*	What does that have to do with withdrawing from the endless wars in the Middle East?
t1_ds1g1cp	0	*	But the Taliban was created because of US intervention in the region. Isis was created because of us intervention in the region. These are problems of our own making and design.

t1_ds1epaq	0	*	That may be a consequence but it's certainly not a goal.

t1_ds21p8t	1	*	Israel has supplied america with a lot of intel and r&d. Not all military support needs to be with boots on the ground.

t1_ds1gpot	0	*	Debatable.  I'd say it's actually *increasing* our risk of terrorist attacks.  Also could you explain how pulling out of Afghanistan will increase our taxes?

t1_ds1tn05	0	*	I'm not talking about cutting aid. I'm talking about withdrawing fighting forces from the Middle East. I'm tired of the senseless bloodshed.
t1_ds1xo39	0	*	There it is. You are the authority on the subject so you must really know what's going to happen.

t1_ds1rcz5	1	*	Only one of perception - good catch :)
t1_ds1fm7z	0	*	Ah your only concern if India and Pakistan start trading nukes is whether any fallout would hit American.  That's interesting.
t1_ds1g7lq	0	*	That's some magical thinking there.
t1_ds1gk4t	1	*	And our politicians are constantly looking for an excuse to bomb Iran because Iran didn't play ball with our fucked up geopolitical games(that we always seem to win).
t1_ds1fx0k	1	*	I'm Indian. And by sticks I didn't mean war.

t1_ds1l3ay	0	*	What a pathetic way of looking at things. 
t1_dtrb7w7	0	*	We're talking about an ethnostate that prefers jewish people, based on their race.  Where people lie about these refugees and label them infiltrators.
t1_dtrz1do	1	*	I thought the sarcasm was clear. The Italians and Japanese supported the Nazis far more but that clearly has no effect on Israels relationship with those countries.
t1_dtqdpk6	0	*	So these settlements were founded by expelling the original inhabitants? I thought they were constructed on unused land. 
t1_dtqas29	0	*	Who decides that? Also on what grounds? Didn't read anything about Moroccans being a significant threat, for instance.
t1_dtqyila	0	*	> The government has no responsibility towards non-citizens.  Yes they do. Governments have to keep everyone inside their country safe regardless of citizenship status.

t1_dsqb5yk	0	*	They do, most of the times, it's just one of those worthless popular comments that adds nothing to a discussion but gets karma because Poe's Law... or because it's easy to understand and worthless.
t1_dssr8w4	1	*	You mean like how you keep referring to two hundred year old reasonings for why whites kept slaves back then?

t1_dsqujck	1	*	> Don't pretend that you used logic and reasoning to say this was fake.  No, I said it was fake because I used my brain. It was obvious to anyone who took a second to think how illogical her story was
t1_dt67mgk	0	*	Let me guess Islam is far too peaceful to do something as terrible as 9/11 so it must have been a false flag attack? 
t1_dsmua5v	0	*	He only said that if the culprit isn't quickly found, it COULD be a hoax. Not once is he saying anything close to what you are accusing him of.
t1_dsno63b	0	*	He knows that, that's why he took the time to tell you that. Instead of passing him, you should be thanking him for teaching you something valuable.

t1_du3ar8q	1	*	The podcast The Dollop did an episode about that hijacking. What an insane fucking story. Straight out of a movie. I couldn't believe I'd never even heard of the story before.
t1_du2zqhj	0	*	Do they not have Russian citizenship? Genuine question, as I don't know how citizenship works in Russia. 
t1_du2yu1e	1	*	In other parts of the world they just shoot the teachers and kidnap the kids to become sex slaves and militants.
t1_du33cql	0	*	For sure, but you're at the helm. I know that doesn't make a difference sometimes, but at the very least it provides a different psychological affect.
t1_du36hdl	1	*	I'm an engineer and understand all of that stuff. Every now and then I still get fear of flying (not usually tho)... fear is often irrational.

t1_du2ym3f	1	*	Actually skepticism is an essential aspect of critical thinking, which is exactly what you expressed in your original comment, but don't expect to convince a troll account of that

t1_duyo0o7	0	*	Whataboutism.  You ashamed you voted for him when deep down you knew who he was the whole time?  Is that why you bring up Clinton to justify your terrible decision because you were fucking proud? 
t1_duyzvac	0	*	Yes ofc, since they didnt specify a law that was broken it *is* a witch hunt, as opposed to a legitimate investigation into a specific crime.

t1_dsl3dct	0	*	Not sure what point you are making. Thats like saying I would like this cake more if it had no calories, but I am still going to enjoy this cake since its here.  Its a pointless statement.

t1_dslcjo0	1	*	How am i supposed to know im wrong if you dont post the proof that you are correct. You did make the original claim.  It's obvious you didn't read the first comment in the thread.

t1_dsljo8s	1	*	Like this: 
t1_dsl76dp	0	*	LOL I missed that part where you called me a racist.  Yes, when folks like you call people you don't even know (me, for example) racist and sexist, those terms have lost all meaning.
t1_dsl80cn	0	*	Some people like to argue against whatever character in their head would most likely say whatever you said. The rest is assumed and you should just leave it be. 
t1_dsl5gsn	0	*	Vaccines aren't necessarily perfect and could affect a minuscule subset of the population negatively, but the benefits far outweigh the risks. People who aren't anti-science recognize this.

t1_dsm0xk6	1	*	I always make sure to set out my salad so it can watch as I plant its seeds. Hopefully aliens see me giving my salads children a good home so they make sure to give my kids to a good Foster parent. 
t1_dsm7cv4	1	*	>The opposite could be true too.   This is why i didnt specify whether good or bad.   Also, my points are similar.   Its all about potential.

t1_duowvei	1	*	And I prefer meddling to physical violence.
t1_dupl1f3	0	*	I'd say Capitalism is inherently neutral. What do you mean with regard to Communism and right wing ideology? Are you saying the Right is evil or what?
t1_duq1s7k	1	*	The US didnt start out heterogenous. It was 90+% white until the 20th century. 85% white until about 1965.
t1_dupvlsi	1	*	nope thats dumb as hell
t1_dtyvyi2	1	*	Maybe you should stop calling people retards, demanding sources and providing inconclusive ones. Probably be a good start.  Also, you seem to get in a lot of those contests.

t1_dtl61h0	1	*	If you said EVERY person in hollywood is either a victim or an abuser yes that would be nonsense.
t1_dupqfrr	0	*	Duuude, seriously?  Black culture can't kill in industrial scale, it's white culture that sells them such weapons. How do you like that?
t1_duqymuj	1	*	Yeah gun deaths *are* irrelevant, so there's no reason to focus our time and energy on them. If you're scared, buy a gun. If you're scared of guns, buy armor. 
t1_dttpwoi	0	*	Truly staggering stupidity. Even an unripe melon in the backwaters of a small hick town would be able to id NATO's Imperialistic nature.   Rather than hide behind pedantry try growing a few braincells

t1_dult03l	1	*	It's a lame reddit habit
t1_dulbpec	1	*	Lol more Jews collaborated with nazis than poles...their role in it was to be exterminated for living space.
t1_dul0l3g	1	*	No worries, how about all Jewish Holocaust museums be required to also dedicate themselves to non Jewish holocaust victims? 
t1_dt7grj0	1	*	lol
t1_dt6nh5j	0	*	Wow. We have a political debate genius on our hands.
t1_dt6m7t1	1	*	Thats all fine and good. Youre free to continue trying to stamp out a cause of the problem, not the root of it. It will be pointless in the end, but so be it. 
t1_duac6ui	1	*	Americans hate Nazism too, but not because it's socialist (only in name). 
t1_duauagz	0	*	Not at all, but you seem to find it impossible to believe that my scenario could happen at all and we should all shoot first ask questions later. 
t1_dua691l	1	*	Pretty safe assumption, yeah.
t1_duaenvh	0	*	Don't be obtuse, I'm not specifically talking about school shooting here, any time there's a bust with plainclothes police involved you don't hear about them getting shot accidentally do you?
t1_duag9nh	1	*	But they need mines for those rabbits which survive the grenade. They're making up for the lack of mines with rifles
t1_ds89hf3	1	*	And thats exactly why the Fermi Paradox exists
t1_dtaacib	1	*	Yup.. 
t1_dtab3yr	1	*	You're welcome! Sleep tight, don't let the....oh never mind ;)
t1_dscc4at	1	*	The example he was provided with was apparently an exception. How about Jordan then?
t1_dsctl40	1	*	this attitude is why Doug Jones got elected
t1_dscgg8u	0	*	When you have a lot of people left out by capitalism they look for something to blame, preferrebly something that can't fight back.
t1_dsc84vp	1	*	Nope. But antisemitism isn't an issue, that's restricted to Austrian culture. 
t1_dscdqpc	1	*	Except that it was brought up numerous times in this topic before I even posted.
t1_dsft7bs	0	*	So ISIS wasn't funded by the US? Same goes for Al-Qaeda? 
t1_dsbxk1a	1	*	i never said our people are helping along, probably should have included that. heck i'll edit it!
t1_dsceojv	1	*	Maybe OP didn't know it was a myth when they posted. 
t1_dsciewx	0	*	Well white people are something like 90% of the population in the UK. It would take an awful lot of raping to overcome that I would think. 
t1_dscyvu9	1	*	Noooooo I didn't mean like that! Now it looks terrible!
t1_dsdsd3u	0	*	Sure. Im simply stating that you can't call it racist when not one example is given and to draw assumptive correlations between the two like the article does is dangerous
t1_dscc9ea	0	*	And it fits the political bias of the main news agencies.  Sure.  And just so you know I am a liberal.
t1_dscz2j3	1	*	Not to mention that there is nothing wrong with being religious.
t1_dscxtq7	0	*	Not really.
t1_dsclckl	0	*	Never said that, didn't even imply it. Only pointing out that it's not a valid reason to vilify Islam over any other religion.
t1_dscqbfu	1	*	One can compensate for a mistrust of the unfamilar through familiarization, therefore making a specific thing no longer unfamiliar, but that isn't to say that removes the general trait.
t1_dscpx07	1	*	Do the patterns stay the same as they grow? I feel like your get and fingers would have to gain more swirls as your body got bigger. Or do they just start out really close together.
t1_dschj33	0	*	Well it's a massive difference regardless. Some of Europe's most widely held beliefs are the opposite of theirs.
t1_dse0bsm	1	*	 The end result is long-term demographic change, not changes in the life outcomes of ephemeral individuals.    
t1_dscc1jd	1	*	Most of the people are doing it because they believe its true. The myths usually start from some racist dude bragging about some racist shit he didn't do.
t1_dscml60	1	*	You know coffee isnt forbidden in Islam, right?
t1_dscmr54	1	*	I'm pretty sure
t1_dsez2jx	1	*	What does genetics have to do with any of it? If it wasn't passed down from generation to generation, the middle east wouldn't be the shit show it is today.
t1_dsd6ycl	1	*	Nah, they didnt have issues because they openly practiced racism in their home countries and their colonies.
t1_dschhwp	1	*	Nope, foot and finger prints are not genetic, they form while as you develop in the womb. 
t1_dscox3k	1	*	They are literally neo-Nazis, which should be enough to condemn them completely and entirely, and without any hesitation.
t1_dscce9i	0	*	Oh come on you know fine well you think he's a nazi whether you said it or not. 
t1_dsccw19	1	*	I looked it up, it's run by her mother.  I'm with you, doesn't seem like a big deal.  She's an actress, she doesn't have the same kind of life as your average five year old.
t1_dscgvlu	1	*	Only on track day.   /relativity (x2)
t1_dscdznk	0	*	And that by no means lessens the immorality perpetrated, nor alleviates the reprehensible acts. It's a rather odd means of rationalizing it.
t1_dukkobo	0	*	I bet! While you're here I've gotta say how stoked I am about Madison's stories merging with the mushroom series! You're getting up there with u/M59Gar in my book and I am living for it.

t1_duv7vh9	1	*	a few windows were smashed and a dumpster was lit on fire  it sounds more like the protest was more peaceful than riot, and a few individuals grabbed the chance to be violent 
t1_dul9n13	0	*	When did I defend him?   Oh and fuck off. You never quoted me saying that. So you're wrong and I didnt defend him, so double fuck off.

t1_dukaxjl	0	*	Let it be told.

t1_dupsy9d	1	*	Ironic, since liegen is lying in Dutch.
t1_duq3w15	1	*	I'm rolling for almost 20 years. Better taste, more control over my consumption and rolling a nice one by myself is somehow satisfying. I even refuse normal cigs when offered.
t1_dupinbw	0	*	Germany is one of the least nationalist, least right wing countries in the EU right now. Germany should be more worried about the UK with a big military than the other way around. 
t1_duq8tn3	1	*	 Not where she's going to live
t1_duq03mu	1	*	Thought they just snatched young orphan boys and had orgies?

t1_dupodwu	0	*	Warum liegt da so viel Stroh rum?
t1_dur28se	0	*	How many votes did your communist party get in the last elections?     Oh right, you don't even have one. You have a moderate right wing party and an extreme far right party. 
t1_duqih4u	1	*	If you've ever seen bureaucracy in Germany you'd know just how much paper we use up.
t1_duptg58	0	*	Well this is clearly the mentality that we have to stop if we want opinion to change besides kill all the cops. There is no point in discussing this so good luck
t1_duptjku	0	*	Wait, the Republicans are trying to build a police state?  By means of confiscation of weapons from citizens?  
t1_duqk8sf	0	*	According to Internet armchair generals. 
t1_dupum96	1	*	Fair enough! I just interpreted is Dems and GOP both are equally guilty of this, my mistake 
t1_dupt1cj	0	*	Yeah, that has yet to be seen.  I am pretty sure that, acting totally in their self-interest, the Democrats will give us the tools to get democracy working again.
t1_dupukim	1	*	1250 per month. Not including utilities. 2 roommates. Dont comment on things you dont know about it makes you look ignorant
t1_duq0dn6	1	*	He's right, you guys are moronically elitist about your beer.  
t1_dupsauf	1	*	the best Internet in Europe you get in fck. Romania.
t1_duphrrk	0	*	And some mountain goats are assholes. I still don't see how not having a military doesn't save you any money? You're right some people are fucking idiots
t1_dupgjkq	1	*	People are still learning the new system, 30 years ago someone set these prices and market forces were unknown.
t1_duq100o	1	*	HE'S USING BREITBART AS A FACTUAL SOURCE!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW
t1_dups6tb	0	*	For sure it is. Germany and France are so economically intertwined
t1_dupx6b1	0	*	So if enough time goes by Greece's debt will be forgotten? 
t1_dupfe6n	0	*	What about Canada
t1_dupi7ru	0	*	Sure but in this case an unsecured personal line of credit will always have a lower rate by a factor of 2 or more.  If your moving card to card, you've already fucked up.
t1_duq0nk2	1	*	Yes the entire project became a parody of itself when they put that failure mehdorn in charge 
t1_dtmy1of	0	*	Oh.  Then why did Obama and Yates say not to hire him?
t1_dtnd6zv	0	*	I know, the only question is your failure to see the very obvious a by-product of your natural self or a choice based on a motivation?  Of course I don't care, you're wrong either way. 
t1_dt7lwse	1	*	The core definition of socialism is the workers' control of the means of production. Do you think this was the case in whatever country you are from?
t1_dsrw5of	1	*	I know it's all that but **mandatory** death sentences is just too scary of a thing. 
t1_dsde90c	1	*	>For this area, lower than the others, maybe so.  Much lower. Japan consumes 60% more fish per capita compare to China. SK even more
t1_dt6enij	0	*	> if you're a good person, you're allowed into the kingdom of heaven.   And that entails that you don't marry or have sex with a same sex partner..   How fucking accepting.. whooptyfuckingdiddeldydoo
t1_dt6j6m5	1	*	Citation? 
t1_dt6m9er	1	*	Theres a reason why the head of the Jesuits at one point (most of their historyreally) was referred to by the title Father-General.
t1_dt8eicl	0	*	>  complex animals   Where do you draw the line for what is complex, though?
t1_dt6jh1w	0	*	The original comment pointed out nothing.  It was just a cheap insult.  
t1_duh4llz	0	*	No, they're pretty accurately rated.
t1_duh1kbr	1	*	Just cause he shits on gold doesn't make the shit itself gold.

t1_dugvn0l	0	*	I never said she was perfect.
t1_duifqzg	0	*	Calling Liberals hippies is a bit stupid, its like me instantly calling you KKK members or Neo Nazi's, its not really true and its just stupid to say.
t1_dugoaau	1	*	It's a pretty safe bet for anyone. :P
t1_duhn0t3	0	*	Jeez, I never thought of them benefiting from climate change as being a reason to destabilize the west. That's terrible.
t1_dugpl6n	0	*	There was an election, you know.  It's not like only the people in charge of the Democratic party were allowed to vote.  She won the primary therefore she was the candidate.
t1_dugsa7n	1	*	I think you're a little confused.  People didn't support her because they believed that her lifetime of washington experience made it her turn, they thought it made her the most qualified candidate.
t1_duhtoha	0	*	Lol, this is satire, right?
t1_duh2q5t	0	*	Elrond's children were not given a time limit on when to choose their fate. Even though his twin sons chose to stay in Rivendale when he left, it is not known if they chose to be Edain or Eladrin.
t1_dugskt8	1	*	Well that's the shit hole everyone fights over [silly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/1984_fictious_world_map_v2_quad.png)
t1_duhfb8o	0	*	...Are you aware how much of the deficit is increasing under the Republican Tax Plan?
t1_dugtvm2	1	*	Not sure I've ever heard it with bagpipes, i might have blocked that out though
t1_dugs2yv	1	*	At the inception, *all states* could vote for whoever they wanted.
t1_dugxoav	0	*	Thanks. I like to get info from as many sources as possible.
t1_dugwjq5	1	*	Not to completely absolve the man, but I really think Bush was very much a patsy. Cheney and his ilk were the real horror behind that horror show.
t1_dugtse9	0	*	A pure popular vote suffers from the same issue. The greater populated states would have too much influence. 
t1_dugtkz2	1	*	At this point, the Koch brothers.
t1_dugr37k	1	*	Obama is exemplary of what a leader should be. thoughtful, wellspoken, smart, and takes advice from others 
t1_dugyp34	1	*	A lot of that is due to political parties making it *hard* to vote in order to suppress votes. 
t1_duhf9n6	0	*	I'm not making a comment on that at all. It's entirely beside my point.
t1_dugxbn0	0	*	Only because of David Camerons hubris was it not so.

t1_du6e9zh	0	*	Go India!
t1_dt3kz3s	0	*	Amen! Wait I mean.... Yeah I agree....
t1_dt3a1db	0	*	I don't really see why this is related. A human losing motor function due to TBI, has nothing to do with a deer losing its leg and running away in a hunting scenario.
t1_dtvs8ge	1	*	Alabama ranks in the bottom ten for most meaningful metrics gauging a state's success, and 47th when taken in aggregate. The fact that they DIDN'T elect Moore shocked me, sadly.
