t1_dtazu1r	1	*	What the hell are you talking about?
t1_dtbrc4p	0	*	How about give me a source of the unfair Airbus/Bombardier trade deal claim that you made? I am aware they work together but you do say that Airbus is printing money on behalf of Bombardier's cost.
t1_dtay89c	0	*	I believe the total number of jobs is either 2 000 or 7 000 from this plant and supply chain. Bombardier Aerospace hires around 25 000 and a very large portion of that is working on the Cseries.
t1_dtas8qg	1	*	I agree, but basically it seems like they got a softball contract because they're the local guys and they're fully taking advantage of that.

t1_dun5gg7	1	*	What does that mean? 
t1_dumc4ff	0	*	There is plenty of corruption in capitalist societies.  However the evidence shows that there is usually far more violence in non-capitalistic societies.

t1_dv4ae3o	1	*	Yep... Uploading backup to crashplan sure beaks 2tb data for me anyways. I have no idea why they have data cap as CVC and networking cost are usually charged by bandwidth. 
t1_dv4q7uy	1	*	Maybe it got better recently. 
t1_dv4av2u	1	*	I'm getting 50mb/s down, with a 400m last mile. It is definitely possible, and I reckon I'd probably get around 75mb/s if I was on a faster plan.

t1_durhuv1	0	*	If you have talked with American citizens who have denied using nuclear weapons against civilians, I apologize. They apparently do not know their history, and it's disappointing
t1_dur6wvb	0	*	So they used atomic because it did more damage and the Japanese were already trained to evacuate at the sign of those planes or that's the public reasoning for payback on pearl harbor

t1_dusdbcj	1	*	Asians are pretty good at holding a grudge. 
t1_durrg34	1	*	There were like a dozen being prepped in case the surrender didn't come. The U.S. was fully prepared to turn Japan into a twisted nuclear hellscape if it would end the war at that point.

t1_duz0sbh	1	*	Are numbers even important? One atrocity doesn't become ten times worse if it happens ten times. Each is infinitely gruesome and reprehensible.
t1_durhww6	1	*	The relentless criticism that contributed to the paranoia that caused her to take her own life.
t1_durp4dc	1	*	When I was a school kid, the abacus was the most high tech computer available. 
t1_durqbg0	1	*	You have a good point, but war is still fought by your sons, daughters, brothers, sisters. Not that easy. When it's fought by drones and robots, then it will be easier. Scary thought.

t1_du4dmg6	0	*	There's a team of people in a room constantly whispering in her ear telling her what to talk about.
t1_dt75mrb	1	*	Sure, I agree.
t1_dty266q	0	*	Ok, well don't listen to politicians about science, listen to scientists.
t1_duu9bdk	1	*	I think you are referring to the continental land to the left and Malvinas/Falklands to the right.  
t1_dsft9e9	1	*	> A government that is justified in banning you from drinking a sugary soda  The government didn't ban anybody from eating or drinking anything.  This is a non-starter argument.
t1_dsfvic4	0	*	> not exactly a massive difference.  It is when you consider the size in population is 120% larger than Scotland.   compare 6 million from each nation and you'll get closer to an equal comparison. 
t1_du8tezc	0	*	No, you will get a letter sent to you asking you if you want to be a donor or not. If you don't reply to the letter, then they decide. Not before. 
t1_du8dwla	1	*	No of course not. Look at the likes of Harold Shipman and others. However I think we can safely rest on the default assumption that they are there to do good for the patient in front of them
t1_dupu91i	1	*	I plan too, and I would be upset if I woke up with someone else's organs inside of me.
t1_du8ofwz	1	*	You use BIOcoin for that, but you didn't hear it from me.
t1_du8mfp7	1	*	Cthulhu
t1_du8ha1s	1	*	This has become a big unspoken issue in Ontario, Canada.
t1_du9i869	1	*	It's not about beliefs or choices, it's simply about participation in the supply chain. You can either opt in or opt out as a whole, but you don't get to do it halfway.
t1_du8p4cn	1	*	And even if it did, I would rather have shitty second hand organs than organs that didn't work at all. Give someone a bad but still kinda working organ while they wait for a good one
t1_duec8he	1	*	Oh lol i misunderstood
t1_du8zkn8	1	*	Not an organ donor, and I completely agree.  
t1_du8hu64	0	*	American here, we're all psychopaths, just a very broad spectrum of psychopaths.  From We need more LGBT moments in Black Panther to We need to nuke North Korea 
t1_du8onm7	0	*	Er no? How can you own something if you're dead?
t1_du8o1sb	0	*	Well you're self aware if nothing else, lol. I was just being funny no harm meant or anything.
t1_du8fnoi	0	*	Don't you also have to die in a certain way to be brain dead? I feel most organ donors are people who died suddenly due to serious head injuries. 
t1_du8goeg	0	*	I cannot donate blood because I'm on constant medications for years now, and they don't allow people with medicines in their blood.
t1_ducdtba	1	*	And what mentality would that be? By all means do explain.
t1_duaz4tw	0	*	Exactly.
t1_du8q1by	1	*	Colonialism hasn't ended. It's just been abstracted by a few steps.
t1_dua3dsm	0	*	What's the point if you can join when you need and then leave it when you no longer need it?
t1_du8lzvr	0	*	And those people are 100% free to opt out. 
t1_du8y2kd	1	*	I'm not saying muslims keep to it. I'm just saying that it's officially forbidden.
t1_du8gtvn	1	*	Source? I don't think they could unless you were under 18. 
t1_du9evrg	0	*	Yes, I do hope opt out is reasonably easy. But I'm sure not going to lose any sleep over an inconvenient opt out when it saves lives for no actual cost to the donor.
t1_duac6u8	1	*	Not true, there is a thing which is called a hard yes. Family cant stop it but do get informed about the decision of the dead person
t1_du8hhsv	0	*	you missed a word: MONEY
t1_du8oyjd	0	*	Tell that to my tinfoil hat wearing uncle

t1_du8k3b2	0	*	you literally asked why religion mattered.
t1_du8fep8	0	*	So? Your mind isnt in your heart, its in your brain. If youre braindead, then you have left the building, and a beating corpse is left behind.
t1_du95ry0	1	*	Like I said elsewhere, I really just don't feel like it xaf\\\_()\_/xaf
t1_du8v4jk	1	*	I don't believe the conspiracy but I would think people assume they would let you die so they could profit from your organs, not just let you die out of some insane need to cure someone worse off.
t1_du8o5ea	0	*	Its not the doctors choice though, like you said its a panel
t1_du8h1uv	0	*	Right? it doesn't make any sense if they are doing it to save someone else why would they kill you? Where is the incentive?
t1_du8ugvw	0	*	Meh, there's a bigger gap between practicing Muslim and thinking individual. 
t1_du8imph	0	*	yeah what happens in year 3?

t1_du8mhpd	0	*	Thank you, my entire original comment was explaining exactly this, not sure why people still think we are running organ factories lol
t1_du8n32k	1	*	I think it's if your mother was a Jew.
t1_du8fppx	1	*	I think you're right. Easier to explain, though.
t1_du8flry	0	*	> When you die, your body should revert to the state. No exceptions.  Revert to the state, implying your body belongs to the state by default? The state should not own its citizens.
t1_dupygd2	1	*	>If you have no next of kin  ** we're talking about still having relatives.**  READ, for the love of whatever god you believe in READ
t1_du8jwa8	1	*	I mean you could totally save multiple people with the organs of a single person. It doesn't have to be a zero sum game like that.
t1_du8jima	1	*	What about a notarized will. Isn't that a legal contract?
t1_du8mfi7	0	*	Northern Europe? Is that near Middle-Earth?
t1_du92gni	1	*	dont have a source, but burning is a punishment not permitted for humans. Also it is haram to kill an insect that does not pose any danger to you.
t1_du8g0z0	1	*	Are you sure?   Belgium has a similar system. Everyone is a donor and you can opt out. But you can also state that you want to be a donor and family can't stop it then.
t1_du8vv7b	0	*	...But if they're tested, why prevent clean individuals from donating, irrespective of sexual identity?
t1_du94qbu	1	*	> or even donate blood ,as i might save the life of my enemy  People still think like this?
t1_du8pryf	0	*	This is *the* corner case, though. When you're in a vegetative state and your body is slowly dying, this question comes up. In pretty much any other situation, I don't think it's an issue.
t1_du8rnzz	1	*	if its the right thing to do, of course it's okay to force other people to it.
t1_du8fxzw	0	*	That being said the people who are receiving them are also the types of people who cant donate them.
t1_dv2zgxd	0	*	So you use word 'Catholics', but you don't know what they are. Why not just say 'Christians'?
t1_dt32rt8	1	*	That makes it 1000 times worse.
t1_dt3pxqo	0	*	Maybe not entirely ignorant, but a tedious fuck for sure
t1_du0qs01	0	*	You are the problem
t1_dtp7jlb	1	*	Non-profit organization and an NGO usually refer to different things
t1_dtpjwaf	1	*	It was something like that. I remember learning about it in one of my PR classes. Id look it up but Im mobile right now. 
t1_dtpd7da	1	*	Chris Kyle was a self-serving douche in real life too.
t1_dtp2661	0	*	Don't forget CIA recruitment breeding ground. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing. Just lets not kid ourselves.
t1_dtpirjk	1	*	And YouTube refuse to give you any good search/algorithm control any more. Fuck, my recommended is a pile of shit and there's no good way to change it.

t1_dtpq1jq	1	*	Not to mention that the label is going to be perceived by many as a government propaganda label, and videos from NPR and PBS will be labeled now. 
t1_dtp8zjk	1	*	they don't need to glorify the CIA... if they want to recruit you they will. Unlike the Navy or Army, which does need PR
t1_dtp721c	0	*	Only 60% of the time though.
t1_dtp26nv	1	*	In America non-profit just means there is no profit for shareholders. Profit for the CEO? Sure.
t1_dtp3zbv	0	*	CNN is so radically left. Didn't you see all the coverage they gave to Bernie Sanders? /s
t1_dtpr3dm	1	*	Didn't the founder of reddit use someone's song in a video without paying royalties? Great example to set to us all.
t1_dtp8sde	1	*	Many anglosphere countries use this term. America isn't the centre of the universe. 
t1_dtaytpq	1	*	Well good for you. The Dutch would prefer to keep Dutch culture alive. Sydney is Sydney and Amsterdam is Amsterdam. 
t1_dtugpx8	1	*	Yea nothing i wrote says that at all moron.

t1_dv0l9z5	0	*	Very true.  He used to describe the adverse physical effects, but decided, little by little, that the risk was one he could take.  He was old enough to know better.
t1_duu482a	1	*	Go fish. I've only identified a few of the anonymous geology-inclined redditors but we're a small community so I'm sure its only a matter of time.
t1_duu3rzm	0	*	There have been news buzz about the big one that could hit Seattle one day (9.0 magnitude)...is this media hype BS or is it a legitimate concern?

t1_dulfje4	0	*	Ohh this is making more sense now - it's to draw large crowds for the associated honor of having a large crowd attend the funeral. Didn't think about that at first 
t1_dulfi80	0	*	You've made your (upper) case.
t1_dujj0al	1	*	Thanks for the links. Not sure which gits are downvoting.

t1_dt8p64b	0	*	Could you repeat that, please?
t1_dslz469	0	*	It's not showing that you're powerless. It's about not accepting being treated like shit. Demanding an apology is the right thing to do. If he don't give it, you don't lose anything. He does. 
t1_dulu99e	1	*	They also killed a good chunk of the inhabitants, if you need details.

t1_dskxt79	1	*	Ok. 
t1_dskvcjn	0	*	All the non-pink people?

t1_dsknzh0	0	*	It is funny and telling that their defense is like oh were all thinking it, hes just not using that coded language we usually use.

t1_dsxs9zv	1	*	No offense btw.
t1_dsyf4xb	0	*	1st amendment doesnt protect you from a private company firing you for saying something. 
t1_dsxzm57	1	*	I doubt it but maybe. Most people would be too worried about getting fired to pocket less than $25. 
t1_dsyct9j	1	*	Problem is many of those shops try too hard to be unique and price their coffee as high as Starbucks. It's hard to find an actual place that just gives you a cup of good coffee for a reasonable price.
t1_dsxx6uo	0	*	Yeah, but you have to use it to jab others in the ass that try frequenting those establishments.
t1_dsxqk68	1	*	I guess that's what you get when you pay people so little for handling your money that somebody needs to make a law about how little you can pay your employees.
t1_dsy1wff	0	*	> Although he hasn't done much involving the economy yet.  Largest tax reform in over 30 years.

t1_dsxdecx	0	*	LOL - you work for any unions in Ontario?  My ex-unionized employees tell me it's pretty comment to issue threats.  I personally, have never belonged to a union, but 80% of my employees are ex-union.
t1_dsxvfmh	1	*	Canada may be different, but nearly *every* advertised sale at any chain in the U.S. *always* says at participating locations.  There's no false advertising, you just aren't participating.

t1_dsxqmu4	0	*	It used to be good until the company was bought and they lost their supplier to McDonald's iirc.   McCafe has great coffee IMO.
t1_dsxu8ux	1	*	The problem with H-1B at the moment is that it's essentially a lottery. Visas are given out based on luck rather than by merit.
t1_dsxfb3f	1	*	Yet the company as a whole... Is doing good. So this put a the franchise owners in the same pool as the minimum wage workers. They are being shit on.
t1_dsy6xsu	1	*	Have you not had all dressed chips? They just gotta pack them bastards in a bottle. 
t1_dsy8xvt	1	*	Employees are an investment not a cost. Companies won't pay them more than the employees return. It's not like if you pay your employee 40% more he'll work 40% harder.

t1_dtvj7p2	0	*	Which means nothing. Humans have been enslaving each other for thousands of years. You're fallaciously arguing by tradition. 
t1_dtvgepz	0	*	As a hunter, real hunting is important. People who go to a fragile ecosystem like in Africa to fuck shit up arent hunters. Also dont worry, the good part about being wrong is you can learn.

t1_dut88v8	1	*	Capitalism is still alive and well in France 
t1_duraoqq	1	*	Glad you expanded on your comment, because without context it just looks like you were just peddling a different narrative. It's just another piece of this current mess. 
t1_dte9hmy	0	*	But Umir he has an electrical cord wrapped his neck and the gun is in the other room?
t1_dte5kvr	0	*	Yeah...there's still some bugs. We often have trouble with the Trump bubble.

t1_dtdujvq	0	*	You want to be ruled by the rich? Well congratulations!
t1_dte4cji	0	*	It might not matter. His support domestically is suffering from the recession triggered by the American-led sanctions. 
t1_dte1krx	1	*	Yeah, you were vague. I see you refined it further down.
t1_dtdtimh	1	*	Maybe if he released his tax returns, and didn't have all these shell corporations....
t1_dtduv04	0	*	Yeltsin is faaaaaaaaaaar from fondly remembered tbh
t1_dte48af	1	*	It's a joke targeted at gun control, not those against gun control. 
t1_dte0dz3	1	*	That's exactly how I feel about the protests we have daily here in Poland.
t1_dtduirh	1	*	I agree that it is difficult to get people to go to the polls, but we really can't ignore the glaring problem of voter suppression and how damaging that is to American democracy 
t1_dte917u	0	*	I'll just settle on your conclusion that I know nothing about the us and russia and this is all about feelings. I'm convinced.
t1_dte1p4h	1	*	Not if US politics have any say in the matter. :(

t1_dte3yn3	1	*	Bad press in the rest of the world I would guess.
t1_dte74cg	1	*	Mmm Hmm
t1_dteq4pm	1	*	China has a signifigantly harder control over media, opposition and people in general though. That surely plays a role.
t1_dtdqec7	0	*	I too like to pick my media based on my personal fee fees.  If you cant find anything redeeming about mainstream media, youre a crackpot.

t1_dte300z	1	*	I dont think reddit is really the place to be serious
t1_dte3yuk	1	*	That's ironic, as the word martyr was invented at the time when all societies were authoritarian. Do you think the Roman Emperors believed in free press as they fed Christians to the lions?
t1_dte2zho	0	*	When the justice system is corrupt and stops providing justice, you get justice by your own means. If you can't do that, you are not living in a free country anymore but a police state.
t1_dtdvx1g	1	*	Am I the only one interpreting this as schoolboys in public office?
t1_dtdzlp7	1	*	Ah yes, Russian meddling in elections. Tell me, what exactly did they do? Specifics here, I want you to tell me exactly what Russia did.
t1_dtdxheu	1	*	To be honest what you described is basically a situation in every country. Some goverments are just better at hiding it. Any politician that was able to get to capital level got their hands dirty.
t1_dtdtgec	0	*	Can't believe those people. Like a jehovahs witness rejecting blood transfusion for a bullet hole cause of crazy nonsense belief.

t1_dte2jc5	0	*	Killing millions upon millions of innocent civilians is not a good thing.
t1_dtehors	1	*	A crackdown on corruption in Russia just led to an increase in the cost of a bribe. 
t1_dsu7nfz	0	*	It doesnt matter what think illegal immigrants motives are.   The United States should enforce its laws, removing and preventing illegal immigrants from entry enforces US law.

t1_dt5ebr7	1	*	How are the counsels in the UK? Is there a dedicated department for it or do they use a pooling system or..?
t1_dt4z3lh	1	*	I know, I was agreeing on the absurdity of it all.  They use isolated incidents to make broad sweeping generalizations, then get all pissy when the same is done to them.
t1_dt655ne	1	*	Then that's not being very smart is it?

t1_dsy2lzm	0	*	Sure, except there is no such thing.   What they call '1967 border' is the 1949 armistice line which the Arabs insisted was not a border. 
t1_dsubmro	0	*	Everyone should just obey every rule laid down by others that they had no part in making? What a fucked up standard you live by.
t1_dsugyzz	1	*	That would be like saying the antebellum United States did not practice racialized slavery because there were free black people in the North.
t1_duzrjb6	1	*	They don't, but they are absolutely sure they do.
t1_duhb8gz	1	*	Theres a reason billionaires like Betsy Desvous hate public education; it makes the riff raff indignant.

t1_ds9rba9	1	*	Wow

t1_dsna63n	1	*	Seriously don't know what that guy is talking about, we have defenses all over the Pacific besides Hawaii.

t1_duwjfe1	1	*	Thanks
t1_duuqnre	1	*	That's why good navies don't send carriers out unescorted. It's an arms race actually, a better anti-ship missile means it's necessary to develop better missile defenses, and so on.

t1_duv3ldi	1	*	To be honest, the relationship between France and Brazil today could not be better.  It's just that at the time, both countried had very shitty governments.

t1_dsnko3b	1	*	That's just sad.
t1_dsh2p76	1	*	It's because they often make most of their income off shares in the company. It's no uncommon to see a CEO make a million a year, then make 50 million in shares.

t1_dsgycff	1	*	It's because he probably took a pay cut so that employees get decent wages, duh
t1_dshkumx	1	*	I'd love to see them fail. Between their wholehearted abuse of the TFW program and now this, they can burn... buuuut you're right, they won't.

t1_dsh4mys	0	*	sorry to break it to you... but back in the day the dough came in frozen (back when donuts were still made by hand on site), so it was still a thawed out hockey puck.  A bigger one to be fair, though
t1_duyao0t	0	*	So, the economic catastrophe is already so prevalent that you've noticed it anecdotally, but you can't see it in the data because it hasn't happened yet? Gotcha.
t1_dshh8hm	1	*	Most Hip Listeners either have the CD's or uploaded them to their Itunes like proper Canadians!
t1_dsh39bt	1	*	No, because its bullshit. Tims coffee has been consistent (and terrible) for a decade. 
t1_dshnv1w	1	*	> It's not bad, but if you're looking for a quick bite and have choices, Tim's isn't high on the list.  You don't need to be nice. It's bad.

t1_dsm3brm	0	*	Hey, the T_D brigade is here!
t1_dslyz3p	0	*	Yes, I understand what you're saying. He is unfit to be president by your standards. However, he met the qualifications.
t1_dsm3r8s	0	*	That is exactly what the people who support Trump want. America first. China can do their colonizing of Africa or whatever. Don't give a slightest fuck.
t1_dslvmby	0	*	As stereotypical passive asian american nerds, that didn't happen lol - We did talk about it later though with some laughs.
t1_dsly2m9	0	*	So are you Chinese or Japanese? 
t1_dsm3g8e	1	*	Counter point: If the majority of republicans aren't offended every time Trump does something like this, why are none of them condemning him or using their platform to denounce the rhetoric he uses?
t1_dslvet1	0	*	Ironically, I'd tell people I'm from anywhere *but* Reddit. 
t1_dslyb6v	1	*	Oh, don't get me wrong, on a PERSONAL level Trump is horrible. But realistically he is politically capable, at least from a Conservative perspective.

t1_dsm1hhr	0	*	There is a pretty important distinction between someone being racist and someone who's just ignorant.
t1_dsmc555	1	*	Ummm, seriously? I thought it was pretty clear she is not the right candidate. If you get beat by trump at anything other than lawsuits then you probably shouldn't do that thing anymore.

t1_dudza18	1	*	it is illegal in Canada too
t1_due3heb	1	*	I wonder if that could be improved with technology. Build a pill box that can signal the patients smart phone when it is opened. The phone reminder to take the pill stops when the box is opened.

t1_dudypz3	1	*	Its no longer south vs north.  Its rural vs urban. 
t1_dudysim	1	*	Worse then allowing them to advertise medication on TV, its about 20~40% of the advertisements on TV in the USA, and canada where we get US stations. 
t1_dudy4km	1	*	You can choose which GP you want to see and you can also go and see a private one... no one is stopping you.

t1_dudsk7e	0	*	He definitely is saying its hard to swallow? Maybe get some glasses 
t1_due76c6	1	*	But not when you concatenate. 
t1_dudydyn	1	*	PK is absorbance and clearance
t1_due6ar8	0	*	So youre saying that in this singular instance, that is a point in the favor of China? Because they sure as shit dont care about patents or trademarks.
t1_duduwew	1	*	No one is dying because they can't get naproxen and esomeprazole in the same pill. That drug for tb though. Different matter. 
t1_due2igf	1	*	Obviously some doctors in denial here.
t1_dudyi4r	1	*	I don't think folks are arguing two drugs in one is a bad idea, but that it isn't worth a 20x markup.
t1_duds1pp	0	*	Then people would pick the far cheaper option that pays out 2% of what the big guy pays out for coverage.  Something doesn't add up.  I believe most insurance companies do not cover vimovo
t1_dudvc3b	1	*	Why? People pay tax, and they benefit from what the tax pays for. Nothing wrong with that
t1_dudx4fu	1	*	Why? Just dont buy the Camry. Buy the Civic or Jetta instead.
t1_duexwzh	0	*	You must be Canadian? Apparently they dont have private hospitals but with how efficient your system is you dont need it.
t1_dudu5kz	0	*	Yes. It's quite a different thing to say IP law in need of reform. to IP inherently stops competition and innovation.
t1_dudxmjd	1	*	You should see how happy and pretty the people in heroes medication commercials are. Like Im almost jealous and want heroes. Almost
t1_dudsakb	1	*	and property rights (besides those enforced by you yourself or the private militia you hire), you don't have a free market where the government does shit!

t1_ds366pv	1	*	The approaches are as follows:  Fascism (actual honest-to-goodness Nazis, as in NSDAP, as in Hitler, and not 'someone I disagree with') = .45 applied to the head  Shariah = .45 applied to the head
t1_duw26yj	1	*	I never said they had to be good reason.

t1_dulfp4h	1	*	Let's see the evidence, and not just some shitpost blog please. Verified facts.
t1_dumo94a	1	*	> Outside of getting Trump elected  So basically it has affected everything? Executive appoints Supreme Court, head of departments and national direction. Regulatory capture is now the new norm. 
t1_dum8ajn	0	*	Yes it is.  In case you were unaware, reddit has a shit-ton of bots sowing discord.  Thinking this is limited to FB and Twitter is extremely naive.

t1_dulj3gf	1	*	Well also they control the US.
t1_dulehxj	0	*	I would normally agree. But I have a feeling we're hitting new lows. I have no doubt Russian trolls are a major factor in all the things that transpired, but it's not like it's the *only* factor.
t1_duo6xl9	0	*	You misunderstand my objection. You can not assign a society of 330,000,000 people as bad without extensive evidence of homogeneity. The United States prides itself as being the opposite of that. 
t1_dullv0f	0	*	By the Emperor that's a good point citizen!  Seriously though this thread needs more posts like this.  Levity is important.
t1_duldxne	1	*	Of course not. But those that don't think that way appear to be a small politically irrelevant minority.
t1_dulft0p	1	*	*both* potatoes? In Russia? What is this? The booming 90s?
t1_dumiy3o	1	*	Haha, it's not because i'm a leftist and he's literally hitler, but rather because Trump's an oathbound Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. It's uncomfortable to be reminded of this fact.

t1_dt6nmca	1	*	As unfortunate as it can be, leaving other cultures to sort their own shit out is a better policy than military interventionism.
t1_dt9maof	1	*	There are always cases,  but let's hope the rate is small.

t1_dstqrz1	1	*	Israel is the last bastion of western civilization in the Middle East, especially with the direction Turkey is headed. Such things aren't dropped lightly.
t1_dst9cp1	1	*	If that's how you feel, then message the admins and add it to rediquitee. A quote only implies it's someone else's words, not mine.   Your assumptions =/= bad manners. 
t1_dst12oq	0	*	The Americans get paid by the American taxpayer... Its taking like taking one dollar from one American and handing it to another. All that is happening is that we are sending free shit to Israel.

t1_dtbuv1u	0	*	No, Jews have been incredibly ethnocentric for most of their existence (if they weren't they wouldn't be a thing by now...).  
t1_dtbdr26	1	*	I mean, putting lawfulness over humanism is literally one of the founding tenets of fascism but keep dogwhistling. 
t1_dtb9m88	0	*	Well they have a right to live in safe place where they are treated humanely. They can be moved to another safe place, but not forced back into a  warzone.

t1_dsdow07	1	*	Actually 88.7 percentage, still he's the legitimate president, not some illiterate Al Nusra maniac, or Al Bagdahdi.

t1_dsqbhvv	0	*	I agree it's a shitty culture but it's not Arabs. It's Islam. You're actually a racist.  Plus, it's impossible to prove a negative.
t1_dsr3vcm	1	*	I feel the mother just accepted it without even inquiring.  Did she ask to see the snipped hijab from the daughter?
t1_dsq85m1	1	*	lol really that's what you took from his comment?
t1_dsq7ks0	0	*	I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say. Are you doubling down that every instance of purported islamophobia is a hoax?
t1_dsq7gll	1	*	right-wing websites like reddit   Does not compute
t1_dsq3ghs	1	*	If a kid has a device that looks even slightly like a bomb, and then jokes with his classmates that it's a bomb, yeah, he should be arrested 
t1_dsq7f55	0	*	You made the original assertion, and I'm assuming by the way you responded you don't even believe that every instance is a hoax.
t1_dsqbj7a	1	*	That's OK. It just goes to show you that you shouldn't make assumptions. Like pizzadreamer, at least he asked first.  How old are you?
t1_dsq60qi	1	*	Not fake news.   If a reporter covers a story and it turns out to be a hoax, that's not the reporter's fault.   Fake news would be if the reporter made up the story. 
t1_dsqb8wo	1	*	Okay, then youre misrepresenting what the commenter said...
t1_dsq53gh	0	*	Yes, exactly like that. If you understand how bullshit that is, you should also understand it's exactly the same amount of bullshit when it's done to Trump. 
t1_dsqwkz3	1	*	One comment on CBC says that maybe she didn't want to wear the hijab and pretended to her parents that she was attacked because of it. Then it went to the police...

t1_dsq8uzj	0	*	> Arabs suck until they prove me wrong.  What can they ever do to prove you wrong?

t1_dt32oyw	0	*	Was just making light of the conversation. You are clearly articulate and DO season 4.
t1_dt2zscv	0	*	There are only 50% more female nurses than male nurses in Germany. Not sure why you take statistics from the US and think it's the same in Germany...
t1_dtzrcfb	1	*	Except that it's possible to get all the way there...
t1_ds6cp7v	0	*	No the true fact that they have a fence along their Guatemalan border.
t1_ds5mkww	0	*	Aren't you getting confused with Iraq?
t1_ds5p8ma	1	*	They had metal tubes for gods sake. 
t1_ds75jql	0	*	One of those international norms, is war when war is ...warranted.  We've all had wars over the ages, so it's nothing abnormal.  It should be a last resort, but it's definitely needed at times. 
t1_ds64w8z	0	*	You've mentioned 3. I said most of their politicians. So 3 out of potentially tens of thousands aren't extremists. Good for them
t1_ds6h12o	0	*	[They literally threatened them with invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Expedition), you fucking jokester. Calling that convincing someone is disingenuous and very much a euphemism.
t1_ds5r6ue	1	*	Ya I know, it's still worse though. Worse compared to before the war started. The massive casualties are very hard for a population to recover from. Their country was really ripped apart 
t1_dsywv0n	0	*	Clinton Foundation was never under investigation that is hogwash.
t1_dsyvdqh	0	*	Welcome to the internet. 
t1_dsywgg6	1	*	For a year, while he was with Melania. 
t1_dsywwgf	0	*	For past presidents politics was their business.  This is a new low for /r/worldnews.
t1_dt0zae6	0	*	As much as I like to side with you I have a bad feeling that people would vote for him again. Like when they all watch Kim Kardashian TV shows even though you know and they know it is crap.
t1_dso6fem	0	*	?  I don't get into politics like that. What's a trump dumpster? A person that is proclaimed trash for supporting a president?
t1_dso44bc	0	*	Only Trump and every other non-Democrat present.
t1_dso0c9q	0	*	You want them to improve ... by refusing assistance.   Boy, that just ain't right.

t1_dtry9zj	1	*	Are you okay with murdering illegal aliens in every country?

t1_dt1ej2q	1	*	Amen!
t1_dt1el25	0	*	Usually because they are usually up to their tits in debt
t1_dt1lka8	1	*	yeah but fuck them for blocking traffic
t1_dt1ab0d	0	*	Literally none of those things apply to the Chinese at all, so your point kind of falls flat. 
t1_dt1b8ih	1	*	If there were some way of guessing it, maybe based on the position of other comments. I guess will never know for sure. xD
t1_dt1fpru	0	*	The Chinese should hate the Japanese, what they did rivals everything Nazi Germany did.
t1_dt1l9u9	1	*	That and the communists won because of USA's Marshall mission. KMT was crushing the communists after Japan surrendered until Marshall stepped in and called for halt fire.
t1_dt1oocl	1	*	>I'm so sick of bipartisan politics  So you hate it when the parties work together?
t1_dt1in18	1	*	Looks like the leaf village doesn't have much of a future at this point
t1_dt1kijx	0	*	Too far right?!  The Government right now is Pure Liberal! If anything I'd it's bordering too far left.   Economically it's pretty centered. But I don't know much about that. 
t1_dt194o3	0	*	Yes, it's now economic slavery.
t1_dt1ag33	1	*	However I think there are still reports of leaders within the government that has corrupt practices. 
t1_dt1cey9	1	*	That's not how the electoral college works.
t1_dt33fjr	1	*	A lot of website are blocked (google and facebook for example) others arenot (bing and reddit). No special rulers for foreigners 
t1_dt2365s	1	*	MUST... CRUSH... CAPITALISM... GRRRRGGGGGHHHH
t1_dt1qgl9	1	*	No, they have different viewpoints on issues yet that doesn't make their followers evil or misguided. People paint the other side as loons when each side has somethings right. 
t1_dt1apiy	1	*	that sounds ok. Where they lose me is when you critise the communist party and go missing/when they try to control what people can watch or talk about.
t1_dt1o7ym	1	*	Got into the presidential aircraft section for free because my mom works for Veterans Aff- excuse me the DOD. 
t1_dt1a9d9	1	*	Yep, the hypocrisy is unbelievable
t1_dt16pui	1	*	The results are decided way ahead of the vote. The party congress vote is just a formality aka rubber stamp.
t1_dt1beky	0	*	The manchu tribes that conquered China were not forced out. They created the qing dynasty and ruled for hundreds of years
t1_dt1ji06	1	*	There are none
t1_dt1c23a	1	*	By our standards yes. Most of the world was third world back then. German money was like Zimbabwe, London had massive slums, the US had slums, Russia had African level famines, etc.
t1_dt1eexz	1	*	Interesting, thank you. 
t1_dt1gx4t	0	*	> We're not even technically a republic  That's why I said we're a democratic republic. We elect officials to vote on the behalf of their constituents. 
t1_dt1mcoy	1	*	Nope, but I know USAA and a few others offered interest free loans.  Was NFCU one of them?
t1_dt4i6ys	1	*	I'm 99% sure he wasn't Hasidim (maybe he was raised that way, but he definitely didn't practice the Ultra-Orthodox beliefs), but him being Jewish is indeed rather fitting. Good point.
t1_dt1g2u3	0	*	This statement shows you do not really know much about China.
t1_dt1u5rm	1	*	It would, yes.
t1_dt1ccog	0	*	Why is the rum gone
t1_dt1kktn	1	*	You would like the train museum and old downtown of Sacramento, CA. If you like 1800's american frontier and industry...Whooo boy! 
t1_dt1buia	1	*	lol! are you a weak troll or an ignorant on the topic? 
t1_dt1ol6u	1	*	You mean like trying to find a polling station in a black neighborhood in any southern state?

t1_dt1m8vy	0	*	You said natives weren't our people, implying that it was okay what the govt. has done to them
t1_dt1ejfl	1	*	why does it matter? i haven't taken a side in my reply, why do you need to derail my point into which side are you on?
t1_dt1eluy	1	*	Because PoC don't want human rights?
t1_dt1abmr	1	*	Can confirm. I immediately pictured a neckbeard asking his mom for rib removal surgery money. 
t1_dt2jtbc	1	*	Does Trump seem to be getting more stable to you? Because it seems like the exact opposite to me, and that's just from reading his twitter rants.
t1_dt1ita5	0	*	Really does someone thats been hit with a lifetime of debt from school and medical bills and because they are unable to work due to not having access to medical... this is their choice ?  
t1_dt1kbqd	1	*	Africa. 
t1_dt1bw2l	1	*	Which is in the Legislative branch, and the POTUS is in the executive.  
t1_dt55idi	0	*	Well, you don't have to let it go, you could just stay a China hater forever. I guess that's what you've decided on 
t1_e0gxz14	0	*	Okay, let's go with a social credit score
t1_dt1cwue	0	*	That's the beauty of all of this. It's pure projection.
t1_dt1s0eb	1	*	Sorry lol. Traveling in rural China, I lost signal. I updated the post.
t1_dt1zvgo	1	*	Indeed! For a country with so many resonable and smart people you sure have some weird people in power. We do too actually.
t1_dt1lsnu	1	*	How about we start a new argument. China sucks, they use sewer runoff as cooking oil, and they can suck my nut sack. 
t1_dt1b39s	1	*	What exactly does this rant have to do with his point? The current Chinese state is not particularly old at all. It is dishonest to lump in every imperial dynasty and label it as the same polity. 
t1_dt1k9e6	1	*	This guy Civ's.

t1_dt1g5ec	1	*	Poverty tends to result in cancer.disease and poisoned school children more likely than the air and water (at the level it is now).
t1_dt1mfau	0	*	The official number of 251 against the high estimate of 100,000 attendees is still worse proportionally than Kent States 4 to 2000.
t1_dt1brsy	1	*	Probably

t1_dt182y4	1	*	Definitely. But that's besides the point.
t1_dt1ceek	0	*	To be fair, the British did that in London first...
t1_dt2c242	1	*	It was. There were peaceful people and then there were rioters. Unfortunately law enforcement had to equip to deal with the worst.   
t1_dt1dtpo	1	*	Not exactly. Speaking out loud isn't what made those people stupid, I doubt silencing them would've made them vote differently.
t1_dt131nq	1	*	I think one student being run over repeated by APCs is one too many
t1_dt1bosl	0	*	Let's go to Xian, they have awesome air quality
t1_dt12x8i	1	*	In the US, the only discrimination they face is their education and qualifications.  Same goes for China.   
t1_dt1fi5m	1	*	I've been the the Henry Ford Museum so many times and probably will continue to go many more.
t1_dt1bys7	1	*	So, Melania should be concerned...
t1_dt1k55m	1	*	Yup, America isnt perfect and theres work to do.  Were better than China.  No question.  
t1_dt1g98n	1	*	A democracy where a few industry giants votes (and donations) count more than peoples protests sure sounds like an oligarchy to me.
t1_dt2iod9	0	*	Wait, you want people to get a bonus because they're essential and worked for the money they were paid?   Lol. OK
t1_dt1ckmf	0	*	Wait, does that actually happen? Seems sketchy AF
t1_dt1th6e	1	*	China has modern day *actual* slavery. It hasn't quite been a decade since the Shanxi brickyards. 
t1_dt1thvj	0	*	Does that matter? If I told you your house was on fire, would you deny it because my house burnt down?

t1_dv2dfke	1	*	There's a massive amount of trade between the EU and the US. It makes no sense to go for a worse candidate who would almost certainly disrupt said trade.

t1_duh35ic	1	*	fuck man. this is a good point.  If he dies outside anyway, might as well live in prison.  Why would he plead guilty if the enemies are going to kill him?
t1_duh6bd6	1	*	Pathetic and featherweight. $500 is pennies, and I'd like to see the outcome of this particular life.
t1_duh8wdf	1	*	And it looks like...  Could it be?   Yes, he is in fact defending the opposing team's goal.

t1_duh0zwz	0	*	One would hope so, but some Republicans would have to go against their party.
t1_duh23pm	1	*	Definitely. 
t1_duh3pg0	1	*	Correct. It was Deripaska on the boat. He is the one Manafort owes millions to and was offering to provide updates to while running the Trump campaign.

t1_duh7an4	0	*	That's making assumptions though. Until a sentencing agreement is released there's no way to know whether he got off lightly or not. Until then it's just projecting.

t1_dsn3bou	0	*	Cash is more expensive for businesses than cards. It is this way for at least a decade now.
t1_dsn46je	1	*	I was kicked out of a bar when I told the bar tender a $10 minimum to accept my card was a violation of his businesses agreement with Visa (policy may have changed since then).
t1_dsne0k9	0	*	>Then why not include the charge in the listed price and don't include the service charge at all?  Because not everyone uses a method of payment that generates the additional charge?
t1_dsns2dc	1	*	Not anymore you can't. And if they say the don't have change, try telling them you're willing to either underpay or not accept the takeaway
t1_dtsoeux	1	*	That must've led to some gnarly shit. 
t1_dtss1sy	1	*	It's not even about spine, a lot of them don't want to change anything since their priority is making businesses happy. Big pharma pays for their campaigns... 
t1_dtsil43	0	*	Name one?
t1_dtspdyu	1	*	No, they don't.
t1_dtsi03k	0	*	Outside of the institutions of chattel slavery, most people are enslaved when they fall deeply into debt. Is it a voluntary thing to be forced to pay off a debt that you will never be able to pay off?

t1_dsifksx	1	*	Hush, don't point out the reality of the status quo :O! It's scary!
t1_dsiyler	1	*	Ah, ok, so it's suing specifically?  That's understandable.  What about regulations that directly or indirectly target certain industries like a carbon tax? (Yes, I'm a bit hung up on that example)
t1_dsifz3c	0	*	you can say these lawyers sealed the deal tho
t1_dsiyfmn	1	*	Yes I do and it sounds like we as a society have agreed that it's just the cost of living in a modern industrialized society. The consumers are just as responsible for this as the suppliers are.
t1_dsjvtgj	1	*	Hopefully that's what [this lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4346469-12018-01-09-Complaint-Filed-Legal-8031957-1-4.html) will do.
t1_dshw71t	1	*	> I really don't understand.  
t1_dshny6d	1	*	Hi welcome to reddit
t1_dsihfm9	1	*	You can see what the trolls are pushing here https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/  It's not left wing, liberal politics. 
t1_du1aqkl	0	*	Someone got the reference. I love you :)
t1_du1wuvc	0	*	Other than prevent collapse, allowing them to become the unstable nuclear armed country they are now. 
t1_du1gyrc	1	*	Would be as deserved as Obamas. 
t1_du2e8fw	0	*	Yeah, but then we look like the baddies. And this time we can't get Israel to take care of it like with Iraq. 
t1_du21jyy	1	*	Not exactly. They've said they'll intervene if NK is attacked, but they won't intervene if NK strikes first. They certainly haven't promised to support an invasion of NK.
t1_du61nmi	0	*	> Nukes > Any conventional military asset.  Not if they have 0 second strike capability.  And they have 0 second strike capability.
t1_du1q9eh	1	*	She wasn't mentioned at all.
t1_du2m6y7	1	*	Shame people downvoted you. A lot of people don't know that the Korean War hasn't technically ended, there's just [an armistice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement).
t1_du8732t	0	*	No it really isnt. A peer reviewed study is not the same as someone giving their opinions.  
t1_dsrg4lc	1	*	> with a visa  With visa even Afghanis can go practically anywhere
t1_dsrj770	1	*	US citizens require a visa for Brazil, yes
t1_dsrlqsl	0	*	Brasil largely adopts a reciprocity policy, meaning that if a country requires a visa from you to go there, you also need a visa to come here.   That's why we can go to Europe no worries.
t1_dsecjh7	1	*	Because the connection between the browser and the server is encrypted (if using HTTPS). That's what prevents people from seeing secret data.
t1_dsepoar	1	*	Because Modi is good at PR. He is good at projecting an image of change & progress. Also, NRIs dont have to face the ill effects of erratic decisions & policy changes made by this government.

t1_dssqaj0	1	*	No virtue signaling here. Nice attempt to debase my position, though.  Monitor and become legal guardian of are wildly different things.
t1_dur5o8f	0	*	Yes absolutely. 19th century colonialists didn't see themselves as the bad guys either, they were simply bringing civilization to the savages. It's the same mentality you have.
t1_duqjl0c	1	*	And its wrong to do so while flagrantly ignoring other perspectives that grant better understanding. Otherwise it's intentional ignorance
t1_duq4hzl	0	*	Why mention an inherently fucked up event even if little to nothing can be done about it? Are you serious?

t1_dv0b61u	0	*	So next time don't equate the tobacco industry with gun manufacturers. Good to see you learned your lesson. :)
t1_dv0cujy	1	*	The Vegas one was unusual.  Unless there is something more than just a death-toll to report, it's omitted from the news bulletin.
t1_dtqa9dc	0	*	>Wikipedia is not the cutting edge of the facts surrounding Egypt.  Nor are random reddit comments, which is why I asked for a source.

t1_dt08q2w	0	*	The crime stats for Calgary would indicate otherwise.  Not sure where you're getting the idea that we have a bad social safety net here either.
t1_dt2cp8x	0	*	Fools usually dont. Its kinda what theyre best known for. By the way, look up generic drugs. 
t1_dt0tc2q	0	*	Some think since he supposedly was in the generic drugs side of pharma he was bringing the price down. Would that make sense?
t1_dt023dn	1	*	The Jewish circle isn't that big. Most of us know each other one way or another - I went to the same school as the midle daughter.
t1_dszry5i	0	*	Um, I'm old enough to remember when Gates wasn't considered nice or even neutral. He was pretty damn cutthroat back in the day. Just saying.

t1_dtd0uog	1	*	I've had a bit of fun going around and correcting people who spell it Drumph. It's stupid, but it makes the night shifts go by a bit faster.
t1_dtd2d1n	1	*	He thinks people cheered at a rally in Pittsburg and that made him feel good so it must be a good thing. 
t1_dtd1utl	0	*	How is that..? I could see the argument for a blank vote, if you have that in the US. Not showing up just makes it look like a dysfunctional democracy imo.
t1_dtd4ku0	0	*	But having that idea in your head in the background is going to make you come across as condescending, not just patronizing. 
t1_dtd3bze	1	*	Load up the freedom bullets. 
t1_dtdceen	0	*	i never thought id say this in my lifetime but I think id rather have Kevin in the White House than Trump at this point. 
t1_dtddn6y	1	*	Finally, someone with a bit of sense around here! /s
t1_dtdasfz	1	*	The left is losing because people are afraid of being arrested. And for good reason. Cops will kill you. 
t1_dtd41cp	1	*	That cynicism you just expressed about politicians is part of what made it possible for him to win. 
t1_dtd8jje	1	*	because China doesn't have its own businesses yes
t1_dtd1e1h	0	*	Whoops, accidentally dropped this monster 1040 for my magnum enterprise, so embarrassing, how to delet so no one sees?
t1_dtd7wr1	1	*	Blame the people who deserve the blame. If people didn't vote for the troll then the EC would be irrelevant. 
t1_dtczbks	1	*	so what you're saying is, we need to get rid of that pesky ozone layer
t1_dtd2rwl	1	*	Here in Australia you get fined for not voting 
t1_dtd1orm	1	*	I wish more people realized investment income is accumulating the productive output of others.
t1_dtd1o77	1	*	Wow. I had not seen that before. Brutal xD
t1_dtd3lpp	1	*	That's what carpool means friend. 
t1_dtczfuu	1	*	Fairly certain that most of his properties are just licensing deals. But ya, Trump has a lot of liabilities as well. 
t1_dtd2ovv	1	*	Holy fuck.  That's how villains are created.

t1_dtdw84c	1	*	i love xkcd, but i know a lot of people who don't get it
t1_dtcz94o	1	*	What do they do? I don't know. I'm no scientist, and that's a fact.  Watch out For the polar caps
t1_dtd1j30	1	*	It think he means a record high, which is absolutely false.
t1_dtd5dhc	0	*	Dude... He graduated way before his father was president. Are you having a mental break down or something? 
t1_dtd9ray	1	*	I still do this. It's the only way I can cope with the stupidity of the statement, to joke about it. 
t1_dtdbgs9	1	*	Hiker.   Design an experiment to disprove it. Execute it. Publish your findings.   Alternately, build a model which incorporates known historical atmospheric data and comes to a different conclusion.
t1_dtdi0zr	1	*	Then when they develop they get to buy our debt!  Win win for everybody. 
t1_dtd6mq1	0	*	Sure good for HIM, not our country. People need to stop comparing businessmen to politicians (Presidents) it's like comparing a doctor to a lawyer, it makes zero sense.
t1_dsi09lu	1	*	That's kind of Canada's cultural identity though. We're a mosiac. 
t1_dsr2511	1	*	I reserve the right to cut off my sons penis skin because of a hygiene condition that can be solved with soap and water. Thats what god would want
t1_dt6ku63	0	*	You said you weren't married though.
t1_dsraobl	1	*	No, you made a snarky passive-aggressive post and tried to claim opinion as fact. You really didn't think you weren't gonna get called out for that? 
t1_dsqz9ty	1	*	Dont you think its a little ironic; you telling other people that they shouldnt tell other people what to do?
t1_dupz4ut	0	*	because only Americans are allowed to shoot down commercial aircraft? Remember Iran Air Flight 655? Not even an apology from US  or admitting wrongdoing after 30 years
t1_dupj1a0	1	*	True lol
t1_dup6h3v	1	*	Influence
t1_dsv6afv	0	*	Everyone had a violent culture though. You might as well ask why the French are so peaceful today, or the Chinese.
t1_dttrnjd	0	*	Heineken is Dutch.
t1_dttmfjr	1	*	Nasty Dutch piss. Carlsberg and Tuborg are superiour Danish products.
t1_dtueqw2	1	*	Try Grolsch instead.
t1_dtdw1qu	0	*	Vladimir?
t1_dtdrebt	0	*	But increased military spending increases tension. Especially if you actually quote another nation as the reason to do so.  Both have an effect on each other
t1_dt9tov1	0	*	Statistical minority is a different term from visible minority.    
t1_dt8nl51	0	*	Do you read very much?  Im just curious, that comment is following the general trend of these threads
t1_dt9txaj	1	*	Extrapolating is so good.
t1_dt9osl2	0	*	What is your evidence for this believed decrease? Your link doesn't provide any.
t1_dt8w41k	1	*	I mean I think it has far more to do with social conditioning. It is far more acceptable for men to underperform in school. 
t1_dt8u3y5	1	*	You do realise by holding men accountable for things they literally have no control over (mythical 'privilege') you are yourself being very sexist?
t1_dt8lu5e	0	*	Hook line and sinker is usually used like a you fell for it completely sort of phrase. Imagine a fish thats eaten not only the hook/bait, but also the sinker as well as most of the fishing line.
t1_dt90jdj	1	*	If you are waiting until 2 hours before the deadline to start prepping tax returns, you are a pretty shitty accountant.
t1_dt9kfwo	0	*	No he's saying he doesn't believe they're the right thing to do
t1_dt9qff5	0	*	Almost like patriarchal systems negatively affect men as well.   If only a group existed that were trying to replace them with something better. 
t1_dt9cikq	1	*	Wow you have a lot of anger in you. Sorry friend I hope you feel better soon.
t1_dt9djge	0	*	Professors also do take home finals since they want quality work rather than a quick info dump.
t1_dt8p3o9	0	*	Im just saying if you want to discriminate against men atleast give the benefits, too. Personally, no discrimination would be the ideal.
t1_dsjucbt	1	*	They also didn't have to bail out half of europe and millions of welfare immigrants, kind of impressive germany managed to have a surplus while wasting money on so much stupid things.
t1_du62mxa	1	*	And Arafat and the Palestinians have been calling for peace since the late 80s
t1_dunoygq	1	*	Skeezy.
t1_duib1nc	1	*	Maybe perspective, but now that you ask that maybe being poor is seen as third world living. Most people don't sign up to live in third world areas, that's for sure.
t1_dui9oqx	0	*	You have provided zero evidence that your claim is true.  So you opinion on this matter is worthless.
t1_duicc3t	1	*	The truth is not always pleasant. The government is by nature corrupt and ineffective.
t1_duirx2n	0	*	So you assume abuse, when abuse was not mentioned, only the words significantly more. That's a terrible argument if it's based on an assumption.
t1_duiahml	1	*	Yeah but 80 years ago people didn't really have a choice.  Post WW2, the only economy was the US economy. They didn't have to compete with anyone. Now they do so rates had to drop.
t1_dui8jlr	0	*	Perhaps I was thinking of social security, which does have a cap.
t1_duiahfv	0	*	What is?
t1_dujk9lq	1	*	What other people save doesn't matter to me. I don't have envy of what others have worked for or had given to them
t1_duibi7g	1	*	Usually literature helps too, but for some of those billionaires that I've heard about there's too much distraction to even read the back cover.
t1_dui8q6z	1	*	So this is why every billionaire is also a philanthropist. So Soros giving his entire wealth to the Open Society Foundation is because he thinks he is going to die soon?
t1_dui8etu	1	*	Because neither did the middle class. Raising taxes on the higher end could allow a higher minimum threshold for taxes and lower them on others rather than contributing to a surplus. 
t1_dui8d73	0	*	I thought trump revoked that? 
t1_duias22	0	*	The people who benefit the most from public infrastructure should also be the ones to invest more in it. 
t1_duiaaq7	1	*	We da real mvps
t1_dui8ubs	0	*	Queue the Clinton Foundation. Charities are tax shelters and aside from the Childrens Hospital, most are shit. I will always donate to the childrens hospital. Great charity.
t1_dui3o6s	1	*	I'll gladly pay at the rate I think someone of my income level should have. Redistributing from rich to poor is my goal. I'm middle class. 
t1_dui9loo	1	*	>  the rich get fucked   *snort*
t1_dui2nw9	0	*	Sure but name 1 person in those groups that has done more alone.  Edit: I also never claimed he did the most I just said he is noteworthy for his contributions.
t1_duiazgl	1	*	False. Corporate welfare is significantly more costly than social welfare
t1_dui7uxh	1	*	Not sure on accuracy but this article lists some of the wealthiest and poorest presidents in today's dollars. Sadly it only counts to under $1 million which is basically 90% of the US.
t1_dui9fxl	1	*	No, they make less than 30% of the income.  https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2016-update/
t1_dui6yc5	0	*	We don't get a concentration of generational wealth?
t1_dui9azj	1	*	Huh, so like the majority of the middle class. Go figure.
t1_duip7tz	0	*	My bad.  I read that as yoi were saying they were prevented from bad behavior with the regulations left in place.  Sorry!
t1_duie2cq	0	*	https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/16/17021248/russian-election-interference-sanders-stein-trump  What a great man!
t1_dui9bkp	0	*	No, it's not.  Where is your evidence that it is?  [My evidence shows that it has nothing to do with it.](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/07/fsm-irs-report_artfinal.pdf)
t1_dui9jfw	1	*	I second this...
t1_duia05u	1	*	I would say more in the 40k-80k range, once you hit 90-100k you're pretty much upper middle class, and even with a family of 4 or 5, you aren't worried about bills unless you live an exorbant life.
t1_dui8c9s	1	*	Good job conserving your energy. Smart play. Most of that stuff will be irrelevant anyway the next time the tax code is amended.
t1_duib8sa	1	*	Yup. A family in this range is too rich for any help or subsidies but not making enough to do well on their own. Its a donut hole in our policies.
t1_dui9uqr	0	*	Yes, life gives people advantages they didn't earn. So... what the hell is your point, exactly?
t1_duiil8v	0	*	Whether or not you agree with Bernie Sanders political beliefs, I don't understand how a person who has been at the forefront of every civil rights issue for the past 60 years isn't good people.
t1_duib15m	1	*	Those gaps are the strongest justification for a negative income tax, universal basic income, or other similar concepts. IMO
t1_duid1hu	1	*	To charity. Not the IRS. They're not calling for billionaires to send more to charity. They're calling for a govt to take more money (by force). 
t1_dui8qfx	1	*	> take the rich's money ... and there are no more rich left to tax  How do you think taxes work? Tax year ends and the IRS comes and takes a percentage of all your money? 
t1_dui6ezy	0	*	Jedi council though?
t1_dui7ll9	0	*	Making it worse isn't creating it...
t1_duiau1t	1	*	The idea can be implemented without going to extremes like communism. In fact... it already has. 
t1_duib9jg	1	*	You dropped this bro - /s  Wouldn't want you pitchforked over a simple misunderstanding! ;-)
t1_dui86f2	1	*	B b but the clinton foundation is  charity ! A charity I say.
t1_duiaz19	1	*	So the system is broken?
t1_dui97ig	1	*	Yep, I make 50k exactly. No wiggle room. If I get sick one extra time next year I go broke.
t1_dujiwpw	1	*	It's called tax havens my man and 10% of the worlds GDP is lying dormant in them. That's just the money that has been disclosed.
t1_dui8yhq	0	*	90% is a tax rate, not a tax bracket.  
t1_duiapcg	1	*	Corporations  the top, America's corporate taxes were WAY too high, did you know even AFTER Trump's corporate tax cut of 14% America's corporate tax rate is still higher than Canada's? 
t1_dui7xr2	1	*	I saw this movie, it was called ' -.'
t1_dui81ku	1	*	*hurt*
t1_dui85tn	0	*	but we were just about to get to the good part.
t1_dui9pwo	1	*	No.. if you think you should pay more, than by all means, pay more. No one is stopping you and the government will gladly take it. 
t1_duib6q7	1	*	I liked horse and sparrow. Really drives home the point that we are settling for the shit they leave behind. 
t1_duibaeu	1	*	Even if I was a socialist, which I'm not, I'd argue that those deaths were caused by corruptions of the socialist ideal, power-hungry despots, and poor decision making.
t1_duj5v19	0	*	As an incredibly broke student I have to disagree with your assessment that my world is fair enough 
t1_duiev3u	0	*	I pay $1,800 a year on a slightly bigger house.  What was the cost of yours if you care?  Mine is a 100 year old sort of fixer upper I bought for the very large room sizes for $93k.
t1_dui3a3a	0	*	The tax rate was never 99%
t1_dui3p8f	1	*	We'd have to raise taxes to balance the budget first, glad to see you're on board though!
t1_dui7ulo	0	*	Thats cute you think people voluntarily choose to participate in an economy.  We choose to participate in the economy just as much as we choose to eat food and shit it out.
t1_duib8u2	1	*	100% agree  just is what it is at this point.
t1_duz9vnl	1	*	nah we can't even keep the metro running in dc 
t1_duze2so	1	*	> You think china asked for a vote for upgrading their superinfrastructure?  No, because communist dictatorships generally aren't known for giving a fuck what their subjects think. 
t1_duz8yuw	1	*	/s ???
t1_duzh1dm	0	*	How did you guys ever manage to build all those highways?  Honestly curious.
t1_duz8tlw	0	*	We would have to learn to tie our shoes..
t1_dv7lqpf	1	*	Someones been to Texas =]
t1_dv0h0bi	1	*	Thats such an obtuse and one sided way of thinking.
t1_duzggsd	1	*	And it wasn't built by their government, either. In fact, it's a perfect example of how small, private companies can build something that rivals government infrastructure projects.
t1_duz4vus	0	*	>Thats why you need a debt to follow a education. More questions?  I didn't really ask anything, and it seems my point still stands.
t1_duzgflv	1	*	I'm my experience (large company management) western democracies are just as corrupt, especially the USA.  Donations to a reelection fund or free holidays to hawaii are still bribes
t1_duz9hun	0	*	I wouldn't necessarily call Russia a rich country I mean sure there's some really rich dudes there but overall? Mmm nah
t1_duzgomc	1	*	Looks pretty similar to a lot of US airports I've been in.
t1_duz8c9f	1	*	about 3-5 years ago
t1_duz8gjw	1	*	beautiful  edit: damn, it was beautiful before the edit ;(
t1_du4h2je	1	*	>olar panels on top of buildings and water bodies will help keep buildings cooler and prevent evaporation of lakes/ canals as well  Fun thing is that wind turbines also prevent evaporation, locally.

t1_dskazsa	1	*	Providence and Boston as well, I would imagine.
t1_dskptu6	1	*	Please, continue telling me how far apart they are
t1_dt2mce3	1	*	No it wouldn't. The West still salivate over Ataturk and other Kemalist administrations. 
t1_dts4wdy	0	*	I think it's a bit of stretch to think that they were taking racial shots at her instead of referencing to the very popular saying 'drinking the kool-aid'.
t1_dts7xsu	0	*	How so? I never said I am not subject to these biases...
t1_du8ffxu	0	*	Which is why Lebanon is getting aid despite being hostile to Israel?
t1_dtvbdes	1	*	The explanation of why it's unusable as a currency doesn't pardon the fact that it's unusable as a currency.

t1_dtu7u0w	1	*	Yeah youre response was even more insightful than mine! Good job!

t1_du247dw	0	*	If you have Reddit you have Google, pal.

t1_dtemneo	0	*	Actually.. The excrement and chemicals from all the meat we produce seeps our into our oceans and is one of the main reasons for ocean acidification.  So yeah, soy bbq does help.
t1_dtel4u5	1	*	Either/or would be good - less people or less meat. The problem is we're trending up on both.
t1_dteu7gi	1	*	That's 3 though, not 6.
t1_dtge443	0	*	Oh, I misread the context. Right, well good luck with the engineering then.
t1_dtf9e5z	0	*	Didn't I read somwhere that even if all plants die, there is enough oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain every living being on Earth for millions of years?
t1_dtev9b0	1	*	Yes, it has a lot to do with something.  I can't have much influence on this political.crisis.you.speak.of but I do directly control what goes into my mouth as a rule.  BBQ seitan is delicious. 
t1_dtel9h9	0	*	And here's to you personally being among the ones who starves to death. Malthusians always think mass death is so great, so they should be happy to volunteer themselves.
t1_dtgdwio	0	*	Because a meteor that would cause global human extinction would be so much better for the environment.  
t1_dtfldcw	0	*	12 x 23 = 276. ;)   also C02 is a range between 20-200. Assuming the high end is a bit much huh?  
t1_dtejhwf	0	*	There's enough oxygen in the atmosphere it would take thousands of years for to deplete even if the oxygen producing plants and plankton died off...
t1_dtet6ex	1	*	That is exactly why the environment is fucked up. People like to pretend to care but they are too egoist, lazy or afraid to make a change that could prevent environmental damage.  
t1_dtelxd2	1	*	I suppose it's a problem with language. But the actual actions that constitute the use of the word are clearly not comparable in a scientifically meaningful way.
t1_dtf4h3n	1	*	Nice, thanks!

t1_dt2inw4	1	*	Don't you know? Anything that isn't literally sucking America's dick is anti-American bullshit!

t1_dshge1p	0	*	That doesn't make your comparison any less stupid.  The X = Hitler card has been played out since the mid 2000s when George W. was Hitler
t1_dshl0ye	0	*	The irony.  Oh hey look, even deleted your previous comment. How childish of you.
t1_dsh640b	0	*	Why was it not given to USA then? There were cases of nobel prize given to organisations, so it makes 0 sense to give it to someone right after he has been elected, before he actually did anything.

t1_ds6r4gy	1	*	Ah, thank you.  The EU could still try to pressure Switzerland to avoid that.
t1_dsf594a	1	*	TBH I love pork, but sometimes it's prepared in just the worst ways.
t1_dsff8c7	1	*	Pretty short sighted and biased of you to make fun of a vegetarian option dont you think?   Shouldnt we be promoting equality, health, and sustainability?   A vegetarian option would do all that. 
t1_dsg67x3	1	*	Why don't they just eat the pork anyway? Any religion that bans porkchops is NOT a religion that I'd like to be any part of. 
t1_dsgk0ym	1	*	I don't buy much tuna, I think the price is about 12/15  per kg.

t1_dsf8odj	1	*	Knew a few for whom it was an outright taste thing, they'll eat meat if it's good maybe 3-4 times a year. Kind of understandable, there's a lot of frozen wtf are you eating crap meat.
t1_dseu3o7	1	*	Actually, the article doesn't mention it but the guy said there would be pork every Monday for sure. So not every day but once per week.

t1_dsxnh5u	0	*	Well, yes technically its Ireland who's the real lawbreaker here.
t1_dsxscle	0	*	Phone maybe, but not operating system. There are far more Android phones than Apple and Microsoft phones combined.
t1_dt0qyoa	1	*	Nah
t1_dt1osok	0	*	Hit the Aleutian and Middle America trenches simultaneously with bombs designed to penetrate the oceanic crust and then detonate Tsar bomb-sized nukes within the cavities? 
t1_dt11bol	0	*	Nuclear fingerprinting is a thing. We'd likely know who launched it and which mine the material came from.
t1_dt0xi5s	0	*	Then we would know who did it as only one country has this capability.
t1_du8n0dj	0	*	Because there were years of war before ISIS was even created? You seem to be ignoring the bigger problem in Syria which is Assad. ISIS was just a distraction, and you seem to have fallen for it.
t1_dsmsf6a	0	*	True but many were brought to the US as children, the rest that were adults and knew what they were doing by coming to the US illegally won't count.
t1_dsltmu5	0	*	And we see you the exact same way
t1_dsldlje	0	*	Whew, let me try again:  Yes, he does. His entire point was that he didn't want any immigrants from those countries. That's not an inference, that was explicitly his thesis.
t1_dsl34le	1	*	it's funny. his brother hates him
t1_dslxql5	0	*	Calling one person a dick is rude, but not out of the ordinary.   Calling an entire continent of people useless is an entirely different issue. 
t1_dsmno42	0	*	Haha, man, Trump fans are retarded pedos... some might not be.
t1_dslvkqt	1	*	Except thats not true. Trumps comments were in the context of discussing limiting legal immigration. 
t1_dsl6sc7	1	*	What the fuck are you talking about? 
t1_dslrdb6	0	*	That's some mental gymnastics right there. He didn't call the war a shit show, he called Libya a mess and a shit show. If Trump called Libya a shit show, everyone would be up in arms right now.
t1_dsm8c20	0	*	I'm curious. What exactly are you getting out of him that's trading favorably with what he's doing? 
t1_dsncceo	1	*	Without this DACA bill Republicans won't have the votes needed to abolish the visa lottery and chain migration.
t1_dslah3h	0	*	Find it funny all the snowflakes are out in full swing on the trump hate over a legit comment.  Sorry flakes, Haiti is a shithole and so is most of Africa.

t1_du3agpu	1	*	Exactly this.  We did our best to extend a hand.  They spit on it, but everyone else sees we did try to extend it so it was still worth trying.
t1_dv6l1eq	1	*	Yes. One redditor followed another from an unrelated thread to say something shitty about it. Nothing at all to do with this thread. 
t1_dtslwje	0	*	Saying it's a number as an argument is not very effective. Why get rid of DST then if it's just a number? Get up one hour earlier/later, it's just a number.

t1_ds6cmkg	0	*	Sorry I was simply pointing out that your original comment was incredibly flawed and incorrect. I am sorry that I have to explain such basic things to you.  
t1_ds6hccd	0	*	Fair points. Agree with them all besides the strike. 50% off all is fair. It stops some people in the unions bullying others, the will of the majority should rule on this not a select few.

t1_ds7g7sm	1	*	Oh I hurt your fee fees by stating facts of reality and not a wish washy narrative. ~~sorry~~ I got you triggered, no, not sorry.
t1_ds8z57n	1	*	Social democracy is capitalism, not socialism. 
t1_ds87y1t	1	*	The vast majority of the country is still privately owned, and the parts that have been nationalized are controlled by the government, not the people. What's your point?
t1_ds94x7b	1	*	You can apply for low income housing (read free if you are in welfare).
t1_ds83b0n	0	*	>they're right in the middle  The vast majority of their economic activity is private. Germany would be more like 90% capitalist, 10% socialist, roughly. 
t1_ds82rrn	1	*	No, you don't get to pick and choose. If Venezuela is communist even though they fullfil none of the requisites, so is China.  And China is a shining beacon that spells out COMMUNISM WORKS.
t1_ds66l6b	0	*	Because I am dealing with someone who is completely unaware of current events but wants sources handed on a silver plate. If you don't know who Elor Azaria or Ahed Tamimi are, it's not my fault.
t1_ds6cru0	0	*	What seems wrong with it?
t1_duz195j	1	*	This is why believing in America in 2018 is foolish. Only rich people matter, here.
t1_dstfnvp	0	*	No, if people want to have an impact, stop making fucking babies. Meat is a non issue with sustainable population growth. Stop ignoring the real issues.

t1_dsnz7sd	0	*	So you can't ignore him? Or what
t1_dsp7rol	1	*	Because I'd have millions of hopelessly miserable lives on my conscience. Fuck that.  Kim obviously isn't too strong in the conscience department, though.
t1_dsyoekd	1	*	Um I agree with you. 
t1_dscxnsj	1	*	Just like the 81 known times the US has gotten involved in another country's elections?
t1_dscjzk0	1	*	Such a shame the US isnt currently nothing but Native Americans. /s

t1_dtp2sse	1	*	Wow, thanks for wasting my time with your utter bullshit. I just went back over a years worth of that guy's comments and he is REALLY interested in Canadian sports, more than I ever wanted to know. 
t1_dtopz37	1	*	I think you may have made an error, as you are posting a top level comment that seems to look like a reply comment to a totally different topic?
t1_dtpbsuv	1	*	Thats not extraordinary for jet engines though, most jets have at least two. 
t1_dtotv8z	1	*	Umm they did and they do, and they did benefit from USA training aswell by absorbing so-called moderate jihadis trained by USA .

t1_dtp8bb2	0	*	The Geneva convention is accepted as a piece of international law, it applies no matter if you sign or ratify the treaty or not.
t1_dtoubyx	0	*	People didn't take turns shooting each other because of honor. They fired in salvos because that allowed leaders to control their troops better and the effect was better.
t1_dtpjcit	0	*	No.  Some die in collateral damage but its also a warcrime to target civilians.
t1_dtpxmrr	1	*	Canadians in the Koran war did that.
t1_dtohwz1	0	*	Except that Russia is there legally, on the request of the UN recognized government of Syria, while the coalition/US and Turkey are not. 
t1_dtpesvd	1	*	Turkic is a broader term again than Turkmen. Turkic refers to a huge range of peoples in central Asia and the steppe regions of Eurasia. 
t1_dtp1fum	1	*	Yeah but you have people not wanting retaliation on rebels to be too strong but dont think that the rebels are unrestricted.
t1_dtparuy	0	*	No it isn't. Carter page was a known Russian agent and popadopolous was opening talking about working with the russians. But nice try.

t1_dsdigng	0	*	It uses Proof of Stake to vote on valid transactions.

t1_dtmrq9b	0	*	Maybe we should run them over with a van

t1_dtv1bbu	1	*	Well thank god the law only specifically prohibits pinning.
t1_dtvl9qv	1	*	Well, we do have a statue of the late president Kaczyski and it sure is making me uncomfortable...

t1_dtu8aem	0	*	You can replace cigarette/nicotine craving with coffee/caffeine craving and your first sentence is still accurate. Do you propose banning coffee?
t1_dtxzk3r	0	*	worse is irrelevant to LD50, because you have e to take dosage into account.   What adverse effects? 
t1_dtuwxap	0	*	Not sure if you are exaggerating, but 12 diet cokes is very excessive and I doubt it's not harmful.
t1_dtus8ez	0	*	Hence why you should keep your personal air-affecting hobby in private. At home, or in the designated smoking areas.
t1_dtv91ev	1	*	I went cold turkey on the nicotine. You'll pry my coffee outta my cold, dead hands.
t1_dttp909	0	*	Hey man, we can argue semantics all day. My point was I agree with the article. Vaping is proving to be a safer (albeit not perfect) alternative to smoking cigarettes. 
t1_dtw7smj	1	*	Thanks for sharing your story and the info my dude, very interesting!
t1_dtu8yzb	0	*	Exactly   > how you get nicotine   *How you get it*  Via smoking: bad because of all the other chemicals and toxins  Via vaping: relatively harmless.

t1_dtfeha9	0	*	All the above.  Not just Russians or whoever.    Probably the biggest problem with democracy here is that currently citizens arn't smart enough to formulate there own educated views.  
t1_dtfapeq	0	*	One is US based companies. The other is a foreign government.  One is legal the other isn't.  
t1_du98wqu	0	*	That's a tautology, the real thing people are interested in is what is causing supply to be low or demand to be high.

t1_dtz9ndd	0	*	If there is only 1 nazi in a country of 82 million people, the law must be working pretty well. It's much better than having nazis in government, IMO.
t1_dtzfl8l	0	*	People still get murdered every day, does that mean laws against murder should just be repealed because they are not working for a minority of the population?

t1_dtyu87m	1	*	Or the live vivisection of victims of tests of biological agents in the field.
t1_dtyyzi7	1	*	And what valuable ideas does it provide? Sharia Law is obviously banned in a lot of countries due to its negative effects, what does white nationalism add to dissent? 
t1_dtzbtre	1	*	I'm sorry I don't have a gold star or Jew card to provide you with proof? Do you think Jews in America universally call for the arrest of people who are rude to them online?
t1_dtzfui7	0	*	I don't know about that. If the freedom of speech is protected by the constitution, then it would be hard to take it away without the consent of the majority.

t1_dupda0n	1	*	Or they could have done a RASH B CYKA BLYAT on Canaan and found it faster.
t1_dsqiq5c	0	*	But my point is: Israel isnt just as bad. One side wants a genocide and it isnt the Israelis.

t1_dsqcqhr	0	*	Hey, did I make it in time??
t1_dsqjjgc	1	*	That's an easy sentiment to say from New Zealand.  Come live in the rural south of the US for few years and see if you still think it's your personal responsibility to effect political change.

t1_dsaz8fp	1	*	Oh cool, a troll. You almost got me, I started writing a response about how I never made that assumption, but then I realized why should I bother if you don't read my comment.
t1_dswglma	1	*	ummm Winter is their natural defence
t1_dswwgi5	1	*	Before every race for a certain period could definitely work. If they were doping, theyll either have to stop racing or be exposed. If they werent, itll be pretty easy to see.
t1_dsw1wc3	1	*	I mean, if you believe the film, he was getting threats (not sure if they were death threats or just threats of violence) from within Russia, just for being involved in the film.
t1_dswkwm2	1	*	> offer the Russian perspective  Shameless lying is the Russian perspective.
t1_dswkptb	0	*	> back to the shit hole they go  Russia has always been a shithole. It was a shithole during that time you call being #1 super power.
t1_dsvymjx	0	*	If a person's meaning is clear enough, I think it's better to let the errors slide. This isn't an English class, and pedantic corrections are more distracting than helpful. 
t1_dswd6g2	1	*	Holy shit.  Rasputin.  'Putin.  Fucker IS STILL ALIVE.
t1_dswamtf	1	*	Already the case, not performing the test is treated as a failed test
t1_dsw5xm3	1	*	i dont think that fits the scenario entirely though. You still drove home, whereas these athletes *chose not* to participate in the tournament at all. Do you see what i mean?
t1_dsw95kt	1	*	im just saying, maybe not satan spawn but oh man most of this you dont even have to make up. Just report the news as you normally would 
t1_dsw9qp6	1	*	Now we have Trump so I'd say that cancels everything out.
t1_dswgjqo	1	*	You would think having vast wealth would make for a good trading partner. Avoiding it because of envy is silly anyway.
t1_dswv8ke	1	*	No natural defense from Europe. Everything else is nicely defended by rivers, seas, and mountains. 
t1_dsw96li	0	*	This idea gets tossed out every now and then. I'm never sure if people are serious, but assuming you aren't, this is a bad idea and has no real hope of giving the outcome that everyone would want.
t1_dswfwoq	1	*	Yep, the market for human sperm and eggs is much smaller. 
t1_dscvkey	1	*	Probably better if you're not gassy.
t1_dsd5p0b	1	*	I disagree. The entire world belongs to AMERICA, we're just letting other people borrow parts.
t1_dugmi2q	1	*	I wasn't advocating against what OP said. I was trying to explain why I think it isn't likely to happen.
t1_dtbadfu	1	*	That's not NASA asking for funding, that's Commercial Spaceflight Federation asking Congress to fund extension. NASA has nothing to do with this statement.

t1_ds2q1ja	1	*	I know right, it's like different people have a different take on things. I watched a show on ocd the other day, made me appreciate the subject more too, should i have not watched that either?
t1_dsmckl4	0	*	TLDR; you have no arguement. You really should leave it at that. Weabs are truly disgusting.
t1_dsmcdzb	0	*	Read the science, not the propaganda.
t1_dswsyv3	1	*	that link I posted is a compilation of news articles back then.
t1_dsdohw3	1	*	Absolutely, and in my understanding a lot of them proves the wrong doing of Israel, facts that both side agree on : the Gaza open prison and the colonisation.
t1_dsdolgj	0	*	DC is probably like, damn I didn't have to pretend and no one would have cared?!
t1_dsdpcl6	1	*	Logic?  The logic is clear.  The people who write the laws want to get as much money as possible.  That's it.

t1_dse922s	1	*	Let's not pretend it doesn't happen on both sides.  Democrats are just better at covering it up for themselves.

t1_dsdnrdj	0	*	Trump is too centrist to pander to the alt-right, I can't see Trump getting behind jew hating.

t1_dsdnya2	1	*	Sorry I was incorrect it is $20/gift and $50/year from any one source.  So you'd need a ton of sources to get that done.    https://www2.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/Resources/Gifts+from+Outside+Sources

t1_dsdonos	1	*	I'm sure there's a record of some form of agreement. Companies don't just pay 30mil without knowing there are guaranteed results.

t1_dsdsj00	0	*	rather them than soros 
t1_dsdynuk	1	*	WRONG!  States sued to have the same level of access as republicans. Snowflake in chief decided he didn't want his commission on the record, and pulled it.

t1_dsdx4y0	0	*	Bribery is bribery, if you're going to argue one is worse you're accepting the other!
t1_dsdu2do	1	*	Letting the terrorists be part of running the government was actually a major part of the successful peace process in. Northern Ireland.
t1_dse44eg	1	*	Not to be paranoid, but I'm starting to think something is up. 
t1_dsdq62y	1	*	Probably, happens all throughout the Presidency as they travel.  Like I said all the expensive stuff ends up in Museums.

t1_dsdw71v	1	*	With hindsight do you still believe that Trump is doing a better job than Hillary would have?
t1_dse3m0k	1	*	Democrats play a much more nuanced game, but it's basically the exact same thing.

t1_dt3psth	0	*	I watched a government made movie about Mao and the communists. Things weren't luxurious, but they weren't suffering either. 
t1_dt3t4u7	0	*	China is 10x as corrupt. You literally buy jobs in government there. Its like 30k to become a cop and the obvious result is they are terrible at their jobs.
t1_dt39ykr	1	*	It only applies to network television, because they're broadcast over public airwaves. Cable can say or show whatever they want, and I'm not just referring to subscription channels like HBO.
t1_dt2e78n	1	*	18.6/100 = 1/5.376
t1_dt29mzu	0	*	All three examples you've mentioned were a part of westernization that funneled money from the largest economic power in the world into those states. 
t1_dt3wgl4	1	*	very insightful, thanks for the response and yes I am well aware corruption takes many forms in many places; I was not suggesting China is unique in that regard.

t1_du6euu2	0	*	lowering the cost of their obligation is giving them money, and someone else is going to have to foot the bill as a result of them not paying.

t1_dtdd6tn	1	*	Depends on which party. The green party are absolutely in cahoots 
t1_dtdk2fp	0	*	The thing is, what good is a powerful leader if they don't provide a good life for those they lead?  Seems odd to fetishize power when supreme power usually leads to your being fucked in the bad way.

t1_dufatec	0	*	Bye, loser!
t1_dufhx1s	1	*	Nope, it's 250k per day up to 125 million cumulatively after all of the appeals are exhausted should the verdict still stand. Literally nothing for Facebook.

t1_duf90fa	1	*	240 posts on The_Donald accounts for 90% of the content? Where did you learn your math? 
t1_dufdm8x	0	*	Your appeal to neutrality isn't sincere, and your history demonstrates this.  There are a lot of Americans that are frustrated with this kind of bullshit.  I'm one of them.
t1_dufbq4c	1	*	They have to or else it would just be the same shit as politics because reddit is majority liberal. 
t1_dufyx1o	1	*	Yes, I know.  What I don't understand is the purpose of graphing it against the 2016 election results. 
t1_dufq37m	1	*	Yeah, they didn't allow me to use my real name. Had to use a random English name.

t1_dsub2ej	1	*	To be completely fair, what subreddit isnt? Most (at least, big subreddits) are just a giant circlejerk. 
t1_dstorcx	1	*	Saying that his metaphorical dick is bigger than some dictator's, tho, that's completely sane. Not saying that Kim is the same as a Trump, just a silly comparison. 
t1_dstvvew	0	*	Just because he's declared bankruptcy a number of times, doesn't mean he's broke. In his case it just means he knows how to game the system.
t1_dsuz6hr	1	*	Didn't some low level christian crusaders sack Constantinopel because of pure desperation? And afterwards the city was too weak to defend itself against the Ottomans?
t1_dsuiqer	0	*	So... you think Trump is reliable in dealing with NK?
t1_dsu5a07	1	*	They still kind of sort of pretend that they are China, mostly because outright saying that they are not the Chinese government-in-exile risks making the PRC start shooting at them.

t1_dsucdtf	0	*	Yeah I agree, the USA should face immediate international pressure to disarm immediately. 
t1_dsufdtf	1	*	The denial is real
t1_dstqige	1	*	Armistice is a formal agreement to stop fighting. A ceasefire is only a temporary or localized halt to hostilities for an agreed upon timeframe.
t1_dsturyn	1	*	Yeah, but then who do people from Jersey or the Isle of Man or Northern Ireland compete for? From an Olympic standpoint, it has to be GB, no? 
t1_dstqst4	1	*	You haven't heard the true stories of the camps.  Picture Hitler's concentration camps.   Now picture systematic rape to produce more slaves within the camps
t1_dsua7u1	0	*	It was more like an olympics pre-tournament I think they had a month or so ago
t1_dsuw8fx	1	*	Meh, it really does look like 50 countries on the map. Each state had its own rules... etc. 
t1_dstrs68	1	*	Shhh! Also, don't tell him that North Korea and South Korea have had plenty of communication in times of danger in the past !
t1_dstp1ew	0	*	Theyre the same ones who said we cant trust Putin saying he didnt meddle in the US elections (lol)
t1_dstr6d0	1	*	I was jokingly implying that someone who threatens to annihilate the entire region in nuclear and conventional war is not South Korea's friend.
t1_dstopay	0	*	I don't think anyone truly cares about Jong Un, though, rather than the NK people.

t1_dstpp60	1	*	Oh, it's real my fellow Redditors.

t1_dstpjtc	1	*	Weird, I'd think justavault would have picked up on the Italian origin given their expansive knowledge on the superiority of Italy
t1_dsuo1ym	0	*	He probably would be if he could. The US president doesnt have the type of power the NK dear leader does. 
t1_dstw953	1	*	This is good for funfair.
t1_dsufg9o	1	*	Yeah, that's the truth. It's an unregulated market, so speculation runs deep. If they ever regulate it, that'll probably drop to 5% corrections. 
t1_dstt3ws	1	*	Is it? Because it seems very boring and trite
t1_dstp764	1	*	This is so weirdly perfect.
t1_dstpyhz	0	*	With these tiny hands?
t1_dstplam	1	*	No... But it would have been unstoppable if they had.
t1_dsu2lv4	1	*	It's certainly better persuasion.
t1_dstotiz	1	*	We're talking raw , liquid Latinum straight from Morn's second stomach.
t1_dsttlk1	1	*	I mean they're gonna bitch. There are likely SK who hate the north. Even if the North will probably not make up a line. And they will only cut 4th liners.
t1_ducdhtt	0	*	I'm going to say yes, even though I know you're only asking to set me up for some angry followup question/comment.

t1_du0q4fp	1	*	You are basically blaming the victims of the terrorist attack.   What the hell are you smoking? I could use some after reading her comment.
t1_du0v2u9	1	*	Except that is exactly what they proposed to do in [Operation Northwoods] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods), the only reason they did not is because JFK administration rejected it. 
t1_du0wyog	1	*	Never say never...
t1_dtw2zxw	0	*	Yes, but we are still a animals and can be easily compared with many other animals. Nature isnt all fun and fluffy, its dark, dangerous and cruel

t1_dsrelt2	1	*	You can download free vpns on iTunes that's supported by ads, might have to change your account region to USA though. I've used it mostly for YouTube to watch the Joe rogan experience. 
t1_dsr3q12	1	*	Truth.  I am in plumbing distribution in canada and we watch cali like a hawk because we know their regulations now will affect the projects we are bidding on that are ~18 months out.

t1_dsr2r87	1	*	I think it'd be worth aiming for air that can't be seen from the nearby mountains.  The Central Valley could also benefit from cleaner air. 
t1_dsr2r80	1	*	Who knew!
t1_dsr6p9i	1	*	That's not true!  Everyone knows the smog is fake, created by a giant smog machine...now they need a giant air purifier! Its all just a racket.  /s just in case.

t1_dtvmbm8	0	*	Youre right but who gives a shit that wasn't the point where they came from, they're just one of many extremist groups pushing for modesty laws wherever they go
t1_duy7y1m	1	*	It's illegal in the Netherlands, but mainly as a loophole for police forces. If they think someone is committing suicide in their home, they have a lawfull reason to enter the building.
t1_duxshe0	1	*	During the prohibition of alcohol in the United States, organized crime grew in size and violence.

t1_du4qeac	1	*	I am the opposite, I hate all the precious sunlight being wasted in the morning while I can't enjoy it and feel miserable.  It's much better in the evening when I have much more energy and freetime.
t1_du4ipvd	0	*	Except school children aren't regular commuters. Once you get on the road at the end of the day, it's not uncommon to have no sunlight left. 
t1_du5l86f	1	*	And you feel super virtuous to up so early.
t1_du486qg	1	*	Correct, 8pm is after 6pm.  Well done.
t1_du48feo	1	*	Definitely. 9am sunrise, 4pm sunset. Pretty much don't see the sun unless I take a walk on my lunch break.
t1_du4aeix	0	*	Compared to people who can't change their alarm clocks to enjoy the sunshine they love so dearly?
t1_du4hw9p	1	*	They know when to watch Bread or One Foot in the Grave, and they can't suddenly watch it an hour earlier or later.

t1_dty5g37	1	*	Godemperor Donald I of course!
t1_dty5db6	1	*	Yes
t1_dtemmd7	1	*	Maybe it's the lack thereof a point.   Donald does something not bad >>> oh no this isn't something I can complain about, I better bring up something that somebody else did and blame it on him
t1_dt0jcfg	0	*	Oh My, you are astoundingly naive
t1_dt0oe18	1	*	You have no idea... the US killed 25% of all North Koreans with bombs and bullets 
t1_dsyea9z	1	*	No, just that American.  Notice how they wrote all tbose words and had nothing to say.

t1_dt8700u	1	*	We don't see grandpa much

t1_dt6r4ri	0	*	To West Bank I'm sure it's happening (to avoid tax at customs, not because goods can't go through).  But Gaza? I highly doubt it.

t1_dtmnuu7	1	*	Nah, that's closer to a ZJ
t1_dtmc3ix	0	*	That's the technicality they sort-of got him on, but the investigation was about his relationship with (and accused sexual harassment) women while governor and president.
t1_dtrl6go	1	*	If we follow this logic, there shouldn't be any embassies anywhere. And while we're at it, the Bundestag should nullify it's own existence based on this rhetoric. 
t1_dua4aok	1	*	But water is actually refreshing.
t1_du9h256	1	*	No, it was just him making sure he brings his cabinet down with him.
t1_du9beu7	1	*	The Gambia also got rid of their dictator and have a democratically elected President now.
t1_du9dma8	0	*	I thought Nigeria was one of the most well off African nations? I mostly hear about it a lot so I just assume, but I thought they had colleges that were really rising up like Ibadan. 
t1_du9l2kz	0	*	How's Ethiopia doing these days? When I was a kid (80's) it was in complete famine, and yet those people never gave up. I always had a deep respect for those people because of that.
t1_du9ekzf	0	*	I understand that is hyperbole but still...  Which is worse. A terrible man in charge of a regional power. Or a bad man in charge of the greatest power on Earth? 
t1_du9c1ui	0	*	What would be a significant issue for Tanzania?  I used to work with a guy who was from there and he made it sound perfect.
t1_du9sop2	1	*	It's not. Australia has a bunch of good labor laws on the books that in many cases are completely ignored.

t1_du980kw	1	*	This is my experience with four different countries in the past year. 
t1_du89v65	0	*	I don't think that. I do think that the republicans supported a paedophile candidate. Just as bad imo. 
t1_du89d99	0	*	what? It was a great scene, he overplayed his hand and underestimated sansa and (spoiler alert)  . . . . . .      He got fucking ganked
t1_du9c8mx	1	*	Hm. I can't find anything relating to 2018 campaigns
t1_du859ep	1	*	That scene is probably going to be canon because TWOW will never be published to correct it.
t1_du8thrw	0	*	Not a thing that happened.
t1_du8c325	0	*	> shady anonymous sources claim that he says and does  You mean actual investigative journalists, that Trump usually proves right within a day or two.
t1_du8bv26	1	*	It's what happened up until votes were cast that you should look at. Not all corruption is voter fraud.
t1_du87wd1	0	*	And yet both extreme left wing and extreme right wing parties behave in similar ways, thus the theory.    If it's not extreme, don't call it extreme.
t1_du87g2p	0	*	the hatred was already there long before Russia got involved.

t1_du8c3kr	1	*	> funneling funds into one primary campaign over others  Huh? Quite the opposite happened. 
t1_du7x3hd	1	*	That's hilarious. Editing the actual text would have been even easier than editing the picture. They are just that retarded. 
t1_du7ygd8	1	*	Was your post meant to be sarcasm? Because it's ridiculous any other way. 
t1_dujkjtt	1	*	It doesn't sound really democratic 
t1_dso2ex9	1	*	It's further subsidising mass transit, not low earners. Increased mass transit use has a number of public health benefits and would likely save the state money.

t1_dswr241	1	*	the Afghans 
t1_dtd13o9	0	*	They let their voice be equal, rather than count for more. Currently a vote in South Dakota matters more than a vote in a California, because fuck equality I guess.
t1_dtd66sj	1	*	rural votes are worth something like 7 times as much as urban votes
t1_dtd6wxu	1	*	And thats its flaw. 
t1_dtd5qpl	1	*	Lol, most coastal states are small. Inland states are much bigger. California being the obvious exception.

t1_dtdu7np	1	*	While I think that was a huge mistake on her part, she didnt say anyone who votes for Trump. She was referring specifically to the racist and xenophobes. 
t1_dtcju51	1	*	Well let's do a teency little bit of thinking here. Which party is under federal investigation for colluding with Russia to influence the election? Jesus you Trump people are fucking dense. 
t1_dtds2td	1	*	Yes, weve had jokes about stock tips from your barber for a century. It always was a joke. This is the internet version of that.

t1_dsvigih	1	*	>what kind of labour laws have you   Ye scoundrel, what sort of labour laws have you? How can it be that a man doth save the life of another and is removed from his post, nay, from his *duty*. 
t1_dsvcyhq	1	*	statistical likelihood probably goes up a bit when youre 2300 feet off shore and flopping around like dinner in an area where sharks come to eat dinner, no?
t1_dsvqbn9	1	*	That's like saying that face recognition for surveillance is just maths - in the end it's just an algorithm running on some bytes, it's just maths, right? Application of maths is technology. 
t1_dsvsobn	1	*	It truly is science. On every link of that chain, a human used science to bring it forth into the world. To me, that is FAR more wondrous. Nothing is given to us, we will it to be.

t1_ds94v9j	1	*	But if we're talking about the country it's not racist. Mexico sucks is not racist unless using the race of people as a reason for saying Mexico sucks
t1_ds853km	1	*	My current top 3. Bitcoin.  then a broken line...  then ethereum and monero.   The rest are silly cryptomania. Diversify friends.

t1_ds8x4yh	0	*	So clearly North Korea has strategic importance to the United States independent of nuclear bombs.... 
t1_ds7sdni	0	*	Sources at all? I will even take anything you can quote off the top of your head. The media loves blowing shit out of proportion, so anything to refute it is nice

t1_ds9gi90	0	*	NK doesn't have the largest army on earth.  So get your facts straight.  Also, no, NK isn't afraid of Trump. That's why NK has consistently called Trump's bluff and got away with it.
t1_ds88k32	1	*	We don't have any diplomats in NK, and the president has failed to appoint an ambassador to SK. So it's incredibly odd you suggest we'd somehow be involved at all. 
t1_ds7yx7d	1	*	The reason isn't of any relevance here. Without nukes, USA invades. With nukes, USA doesn't. 
t1_ds8odck	1	*	Lol what
t1_ds801b5	1	*	Sanctions won't stop tanks.  American tanks, rolling across your border.  Nukes will.

t1_dsg5aff	1	*	Eh I don't really care if people want to play with piss.  It's the idea that he might have done YET ANOTHER weird thing because at 70+ he still doesn't have a handle on his little toddler ego.

t1_dsg4zs7	0	*	Much like a trainwreck.
t1_dsgbegl	1	*	Good thing the information has been corroborated by an independent source within the old Trump campaign then!

t1_dsfxpd8	1	*	LOL you're funny :) I think you plucked that one out the other end of your body.
t1_dshek36	1	*	The issue is pay. They're freezing jobs, cutting pay, cutting reimbursements, etc. If you can't afford to provide for your family you have to be practical 
t1_dsgf73u	0	*	Anyone who doesn't flat out admit that Trump's guilty as shit and an idiot to boot is guilty of defending the indefensible. So yes.

t1_dsi5413	1	*	Pretty much. 
t1_dsfzh6z	0	*	If you are forced to speak, your 5th amendment rights are being violated.  In case you didn't know, the US government ignores the constitution when it's too incovenient for them to follow it.
t1_dsg6ugw	1	*	Soft power is how Obama handled Iran and it's nuclear ambitions. Going so far as to buying excess heavy water to help Iran stay in compliance.
t1_dsjea8y	1	*	What happens if they arn't sure if their testimony incriminates them?
t1_dsg0ssl	0	*	Whataboutism 
t1_dsg6atf	1	*	And convincing the intelligence agencies of nearly every major nation, including ours, of that small lie. I see. 
t1_dsg4mia	0	*	Soft power is how other people (i.e. countries) view the US, not how the US is viewed from an internal partisan lens.
t1_dsfpf5d	1	*	Buzzfeed released it. Someone leaked it. The Senate, as a body, had nothing to do with it.
t1_dsftup1	0	*	Or it may be someone still dutifully reporting to Mueller. This certainly must make a few peeps at the ol' white house downright queasy to think about.
t1_dsgacn3	1	*	As for point three, couldn't Steele just video call in? 
t1_dsg44na	0	*	Yeah, that theyre just American dimwits seems to be a far more likely explanation.

t1_dsgq0m7	1	*	Tank driver seems like one of the crummiest, scariest jobs in modern warfare. Just a rolling target that every one want's dead. 
t1_duemf9n	0	*	To be fair, they're actually taking orders from the country they beat in the war. Except they don't and never did.
t1_dug309z	0	*	Different company.  Cadbury US is produced and distributed by Hershey's.  You don't get good tasting Cadbury bars you get Americanized ones to meet chocolate standards.

t1_due8ea8	0	*	Guess we will wait and see :))

t1_dtrinir	1	*	Indonesians already do these.
t1_dtqmww8	0	*	Sure, but the key thing, with all of these, is the trend http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2017/10/monthly_ice_09_NH_v2.1.png

t1_dtrjayc	1	*	Apparently, feeding the bears is illegal anyway, so he can't have done anything. :(
t1_dtqffay	0	*	You could just eat veggies until they become affordable. It's not like you're forced to eat cows because synth burgers are too expensive. 
t1_dtqq7k6	1	*	Scientists are the one to blame. No wait, it's academia. Actually, it's science and those confusing numbers! Damn, give it a rest.

t1_dtqb6he	0	*	Me too, but it grammars like it's talking about the quality
t1_dtqmpwl	1	*	I mean the RNC, as a whole, refuses to put anything affirming LGBT equality in their platform, and they keep running anti-lgbt candidates. So I think it can be attributed to the right, as a whole.

t1_ds5wq8z	0	*	I have to ask, do you have a short position on Tesla?
t1_ds67bsm	1	*	To be fair, they're selling cars that are at different price ranges, and as for BMW, I would be surprised if they're selling more cars than Tesla sells Model S in their markets.

t1_dty2mmq	0	*	He was 14 and hid from the nazis you dold. Just because he did so by accompanying a lawyer that took stock of Jewish property doesn't make him a collaborator.

t1_dty2rjf	0	*	Every intelligence unit who has investigated this has agreed they've interfered with votes and manipulated voters.

t1_dux0u2i	1	*	Apple doesn't pay corporate tax, so the consumer isn't paying and it's pure lost money for the average citizen. You are way too confident for someone with such a little grasp of the subject.

t1_duxpeo2	0	*	I'm outta the tax loop whether Trump or Obama or whoever, (gotta put that non-political disclaimer). Would you mind detailing the recent Trump tax that makes it harder to move money to tax havens?
t1_duxjjc1	1	*	You think insulting the customer justifies calling the business immoral.  Ok.
t1_duwn985	0	*	It's not anything against them. It's you and your less then intelligent defence that's getting the attention.  Atleast try harder.
t1_dux6gui	1	*	Hah good point. I wouldn't be surprised if they find some other loophole, so I hope the EU stays persistent.
t1_duxfp2g	1	*	Massive, for sure.  And I think foolish to think it's not being utilized just like Facebook and Twitter were.

t1_duzlrgr	1	*	OG troll.
t1_duzgo4g	0	*	Pretty much everything that article accuses him of, the Clintons or DNC did themselves.
t1_dv08anm	1	*	Agriculture lobbies are a thing, as are scientific studies built around a specific conclusion. Look at how global warming and the dangers of cigarettes were kept secret to protect certain industries.

t1_duz9le9	0	*	i could go for a white russian about now

t1_dsxp0b6	1	*	Im sure thats why guns are used in 70 percent of homicides. Because it just as easy to build homemade bombs. 
t1_dsy3opa	0	*	Its easy to kill a couple people with a car, if youre in a city. But its hard to control, and risks hurting you. A gun is just point and shoot.

t1_ds9ba7u	1	*	Think that has more to do with the cockpit no longer allowing visitors and being locked now.  Easy to hijack when they just let kids in all the time.
t1_ds9uaoo	1	*	Even better.  How about a preprogrammed drone?
t1_ds9vwnv	0	*	Pretty sure the goals of terrorists are not to create a farcical security theatre, to line the pockets of companies providing equipment and services.

t1_dsa904o	1	*	In criminal trials for being in contempt of court. That's not the same. 
t1_ds9kkxk	1	*	that's not really how that works, it's way more caveated than just you don't have rights outside the US, you absolutely do.
t1_ds9vl9a	1	*	The US government is a even bigger risk because the NSA has the advantage of backdoors in US designed processors. Just see the recent Intel bugs.
t1_ds9ioq4	0	*	Isn't TrueCrypt already compromised, though?
t1_ds9pe6h	1	*	Perhaps, although its hardly worth the trouble in most cases. You just count your blessings and hope they dont try every other rule in the book to get you deported/turned back. 
t1_ds9je8g	0	*	Just out of curiosity, what countries were you in?
t1_ds9i6jd	1	*	If you are/were a US Citizen, look into Spain.  I think there are some non-marital ways to get citizenship there. At least easier than some other countries. 
t1_dsbjvia	1	*	The government wasn't doing background checks back then, nor have they ever paid for that. Airport security is paid for by the airlines in the airport.  
t1_ds9etcz	1	*	It absolutely reflects reality.  To think any differently is to be willfully ignorant.

t1_ds9j1oq	0	*	Lmao what? The cloud is still just someone else's computer. There's no two ways about it. 
t1_ds9iwxm	0	*	I'm a pragmatist.  The law should be updated to reflect that it's fine to search, but not to read.  That doesn't change what the law *is*, or *why* it's that way.
t1_ds9rvlx	1	*	I would just back up to a cloud. Restore your phone and then re-restore after you get on Wifi again from the backup.

t1_dscq9ab	1	*	And that's just speaking it. Hanzi/Kanji is the real wall to overcome. Chinese being the lingua franca doesn't really make much sense.

t1_dubhndu	1	*	Because no one has heard from anyone who tried to.
t1_duakhtn	1	*	Weed is very much illegal in Finland and the culture still views it as analogous to heroin. I've been twice, it's ok. But don't lie.

t1_duai7l2	0	*	I live in MA and I hate to say it but RI is a shithole

t1_du1q21f	1	*	He tells them what they want to hear, so the believe everything else he says too.
t1_du1gm6f	0	*	He has a virulently anti-gay past you're welcome to look up.   I'll ask you again: why does a tweet weigh in at all against an entire political career vehemently opposed to gays?

t1_dv50qzg	0	*	I mean they are essentially just toys for the rich so it's not that surprising, but I'm surprised he hasn't bought a Rimac instead given that he certainly has the money to buy one.

t1_dv5jfxe	1	*	He could shoot someone in the street and they won't do anything.  
t1_dv5lanl	1	*	Ford farms out design to whomever it makes sense.  Small cars and saloons go to the Europe, Trucks to US.  The Focus, Mustang and GT are all solid vehicles.
t1_dv80tic	1	*	I don't see a way he isn't a 1 term president regardless of what he does from this point on. He is an incompetent leader and I have a strong feeling the next few elections will have record turn out.

t1_du84vlg	1	*	It is actually more onerous to extradite him from Sweden than the UK, but don't let that fact stop your one man circlejerk. 
t1_du75lgb	0	*	I'm pretty sure that if Assange was able to get to Russia, he wouldn't be *starving*
t1_du7fojl	1	*	He's still a fugitive that ran from justice. It takes particular political bias to defend him.
t1_du8hnen	0	*	I think you're missing the point of sneaking him out...
t1_du76mkx	1	*	But he doesn't need to be arrested in UK / Sweden for him to be extradited. He was talking around London for months before jumping into the embassy. 
t1_du71v2u	1	*	Tbf that's funny
t1_du8jrs4	1	*	Lol

t1_dtyu5g8	0	*	And then, every so many years, it becomes a televised stunt to reverse it again.  Bermuda, the undecided country!
t1_dtyml9e	0	*	That's discrimination heterosexuals should be allowed to enter into domestic partnerships if they want to. 
t1_dtxqqqu	1	*	The imposition of your religion on others is theocratic. Despite being arrived at through a democratic process.

t1_dsn55et	1	*	Could you elaborate?
t1_dsl6b2w	1	*	If you consider a country the same as the general area it occupies, then your logic makes sense. However that is untrue, otherwise many countries are not real countries.
t1_dslgd7q	1	*	Because China insists that they claim those things. That way, it's a civil war instead of a separate country. Taiwan came to terms with the fact that they mostly lost the war years ago.

t1_ds4xp4c	0	*	And what device were you using to measure the force of their respective punching?  
t1_dtlxuus	1	*	Appeal to authority is a fallacy, but is Einsteins logic fallacious?  If not then we are appealing to an authority who happens to be correct.
t1_dsrj7uz	1	*	Afghan dogs knew us by our smell. They'd growl at locals and wag tails at us. Even the feral ones.  White people mean food... Afghans means they're going to get pelted with rocks. 
t1_dsr9n1b	1	*	Wow all the love for the dog?  What about the plant which was raised just to be a part of your Vegan Salad?  That's life, but maybe still sad.

t1_dsduasi	0	*	an artificial state has borders, a real state has borders.  the difference between an artificial state and a real state is the ability of its people to survive where they are and protect their claims
t1_dseqico	0	*	Or maybe the US intervenes in the Middle East all the fucking time and has been doing so since the end of WW2?
t1_dseuggr	1	*	True, although to be fair mobilizing is not an act of war.

t1_dut60a2	1	*	The suppression of the protest in question lead to thousands of people being killed by the CPC, no that doesn't happen in the United States.
t1_dut6m6u	1	*	And I must add that every fruitless protest will actually give the authority more power. There is a reason why some of us are so pessimistic about this political activity.

t1_dsk8bts	1	*	Johnson & Johnson, not SC Johnson.
t1_dskp9j3	1	*	Yea, I don't think that's right.  For example: it is the person's who was quoted.  Kind of like making hall of fame plural, 'halls of fame' rather than 'hall of fames.'

t1_dtc4n8i	1	*	Would you prefer people not give a shit at all? At least they're recognizing something's happening. It's not feasible for everyone to join the military and fight the Taliban themselves. 
t1_dtbthm8	0	*	Why not both?

t1_dtyzkpr	1	*	Note: speech incite violence is part of all speech but clearly not protected or legal
t1_dtz7kpa	1	*	It's about serving all data equally. This means that any censorship would only be done by the host sites themselves, not by ISPs (nor the government by proxy via ISPs).
t1_dtzzpc2	0	*	I very much disagree. Anyone that believes pizza gate fake news did not have their stupidity exacerbated. It remained the same. Smart people ignored it and remained smart. No change. 
t1_dtyz990	1	*	>Manual labor jobs **that pay well** are in lower supply.
t1_dtyz8rr	0	*	They'll still have the nongibberish account saved somewhere. I think you're probably just wasting time and giving yourself a false sense of privacy.

t1_dtzn533	0	*	It was clear Trump was joking about the treason thing, but hes a conservative so he cant make a joke. I hate people. 
t1_dtzdog6	0	*	I was under the impression that this thread was about Canada.   That does suck that they are wound up over it still in some areas of the US. I can appreciate that our politics are different. 
t1_dtzqoev	1	*	And? Obama was a leader of an entire nation, too. Bob Hawke (Australlia), Hamid Karzai (Afghanistan), and Margaret Thatcher (UK), as well. It's pretty common really.
t1_dtzahmh	0	*	So he says peoplekind because mankind is 'sexist' or what? Because if so that's some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
t1_dtyy6kv	1	*	It was totally a joke come on. He's smart when it comes to working a room and PR. I may not agree with all his policies but this absolutely sounded like a joke and he claimed it was so why deny it ?
t1_dtzfqmy	1	*	This why love reddit.  Many laughs. Such fun. 
t1_du0co2w	1	*	> Republicans have not done anything worthy of praise in the past year.   * Tax cuts * Deportations on the rise * ISIS bombed out of existence * Clinton investigation re-opened
t1_dtz7bj3	1	*	Its a bummer that futurology is like that. 
t1_dtyzluj	0	*	Yup, there you go. He's no better than Trump he's just another actor and doesn't even have the same budget 
t1_dtz5flk	0	*	He once got three scoops of ice cream, for example. Do you know who else ate ice cream? That's right: Hitler!
t1_dtzhrif	0	*	That's one way to interpret it. It might've been a joke, but the fact it seems like something he could say is bad enough for a lot of people. But I'm not Canadian so maybe not.

t1_duqpgn2	1	*	The wild card here is the Russians. They cant be easily prosecuted and if their goal is just to destabilize the US they can keep this up and then just throw Trump under the bus when they tire of him.

t1_duqotnt	0	*	You'd have to have a laundry list of previous charges to get more than a slap on the wrist for simple possession. Criminal history is a big influence in future sentencing.
t1_duqwcqr	1	*	Many of the charges relate to federal tax evasion, which means they also evaded state taxes.

t1_duqli4f	1	*	I wish I could disagree, but you're 100% right.
t1_duqocfe	0	*	Conspiracy against the US is probably a way less common crime than possession so those private prisons have to get their money somehow. When weed and drugs are legal, something else will come along

t1_dtomyyq	0	*	I'm sure you've got some very solid evidence that not only am I a leftist extremist, but that right wing and muslim terrorist attacks are outweighed by leftist terrorist attacks. Have a nice life!
t1_dtpth8a	1	*	Oh god don't let us choose anything else! Look what happened last time. 
t1_dtoryut	1	*	Somewhere between 15-20% of the town is made up of non-whites
t1_dtoit5w	0	*	> Polish Americans are pretty damn racist.  Maybe they are, but Poles also hate each other. Just ask them about it.
t1_dtouwhe	0	*	... Oh. There's no Jewish community anywhere? What about Jewish tourists, are they likely to get harassed xe0 la black people in Italy?
t1_dtohzdx	0	*	Trust me, in many countries in deep black Africa they don't want any white man. They are racist against whites as fuck. Personal Experience. Sorry to burst your bubble. 
t1_dtokfxb	1	*	That's completely contradicting all studies that found Africa to be the most racist continent.
t1_dtojikk	1	*	Are you hurt he said that and makes his point invalid?
t1_dtohc8q	0	*	Haha thanks
t1_dtou4jc	1	*	Meh skepticism gets often roped into hate by progressives. 
t1_dtoeoy3	1	*	I come to this sub exclusively for the America bashing 
t1_dtoohoy	1	*	And untrue. The idea was put forth by a lone researcher woman backed by Riksbanken and has been debunked.
t1_dtow3jb	1	*	Wow. You've got a similar population to the UK but at a guess, quite a different cultural make up.  Cool. 
t1_dtosvpk	0	*	I just don't know if you should be giving travel advice, if you've never traveled anywhere yourself. But you do make some valid points. 
t1_dtokz70	1	*	>empathy  Insert diatribe on the empty world of the psychopaths mind here  Edit: whys this comment controversial?
t1_dtogjgw	0	*	Do you get called out on it much? Im Norwegian and was thinking about getting some themed tats but idk. 
t1_dtoguq1	1	*	Lives where, in half black?  If he can confirm that racism is common *in Italy*, then presumably he lives *in Italy*.
t1_dtomlvo	1	*	That Australian flu thing? I wonder if it's the same flu we have here in the UK? Sounds fuckin horrible, take it easy eh mate.
t1_dtoteem	1	*	eh? that is new to me.
t1_dtosg8z	1	*	We should just make an international political party that embodies everything shitty about the world. Then we see who joins and keep them on a list. 
t1_dtomeyy	1	*	He's clearly mentally unstable for chopping up a body but just because he didn't report it to the police is not a good reason to conclude that he killed her. But of course, it should be investigated.
t1_dtokc80	1	*	The worst one for me is the Aryan Brotherhood douche-bags who get SINN FEIN tattoos. 
t1_dtox2pc	1	*	Yeah I wouldn't equate curiosity with racism.  White people or people of color would experience the same thing in most of China.
t1_dtov9q6	1	*	Yeah, but they said random black people, so I specified for them. 
t1_dtoih3j	0	*	Now I want to play dark souls
t1_dtogfge	1	*	If you had a coastline in Europe, your people were victims of viking raids in the past. And they went much farther, too, but not often.
t1_dtq4cfb	0	*	Dude I'm italian...
t1_dtokubw	0	*	Your comment covers it quite nicely IMO.
t1_dtogrv3	1	*	Like anywhere else, the larger and more diverse the area the least racist and conservative it tends to be. You wont see much in London but rural England can still be pretty... yeah. 
t1_dtoflma	1	*	I hate how correct you are
t1_dtopwlq	0	*	Oh really? Was that to do with the internment thing they did for the Japanese too? I didn't realize they were concentration camps, TIL. 
t1_dtoi5lj	1	*	Don't you guys call them brown? Or does it apply to Indians only? 
t1_dtojwpw	1	*	I'd say it's a populist movement with traces of both the left and of the right. Their positions often fluctuate but I would not call them fascist
t1_dtoojcw	0	*	https://www.snopes.com/history/govern/trains.asp  and then the trains didn't actually run on time.

t1_dtpv10x	1	*	Yeah dude, follow your own advice...
t1_dtop595	0	*	It does make sense. Now drink plenty of fluids and get back in bed. This flu is nothing to trifle with. 
t1_dtoj7bb	1	*	I guess hate is heritage?
t1_dtoi2j8	0	*	Im Portuguese people have told me Im not white.     Weird cuz i look Caucasian af 
t1_dtohjuc	0	*	>We, white people in the U.S., don't consider middle easterners black but we also don't consider them white.  Because they aren't. They're brown.   -Europe.
t1_dtovppt	0	*	Have a tissue.
t1_dtp0x8a	0	*	Absolutely. My grandfather actually fought in WWI and barely survived. He wasn't about to go through that ordeal again. Lots of crazy stories of chance.
t1_dtowskp	1	*	We have both kinds of music here: We have country AND we have western   As a white person, white power groups make me uncomfortable.
t1_dtok33p	1	*	NI is the worst place in the UK for racism as far as I know(In loyalist areas which would be sympathetic to the English)
t1_dtou9dz	1	*	If it was Germans and Russians fighting he might have been a little more worried about the situation.
t1_dtopgq3	0	*	It feels like Croatia and the others in the Balkans have been a scary place to live for a while. I remember hearing all the horror stories as the unfolded growing up. Its awful. 
t1_dtomlgs	1	*	its an alarmist word though 
t1_dtovw2q	1	*	Actually is the opposite..whites came to africa and marginalized the blacks in zambia, Zimbabwe, south africa, Namibia etc...now plenty of whites travel to africa for tourism with no problem.
t1_dtoqlgt	1	*	Little locker room talk
t1_dtp6xgj	1	*	Italy, but probably works for the US too.
t1_dtoq6at	1	*	dont let 4chan find out about that last part.  
t1_dtogk0d	0	*	That's just patently false. Take sickle cell anemia, for instance. Most people would be familiar with that example.
t1_dtoffkf	1	*	Like they don't already?
t1_dub3jv1	0	*	This is what I'm saying... 
t1_dubt6sy	0	*	This is the weakest troll attempt I've seen.
t1_dsmozvk	1	*	As we all would, unfortunately life is life.
t1_dt5sgss	0	*	Western Australia - 3 month Synergy bill - $224
t1_dt5ude5	0	*	I guess I was speaking about the storage too then. Its the component media usually focus on almost exclusively i.e. preventing blackouts etc.  If you meet him again say hi from Constipated Dragon. 
t1_dt6nfb4	1	*	Yes, with 3-4 people there regularly
t1_dt71w90	0	*	Its an unsustainable model. These companies are over leveraged to their eyeballs. Something is bound to go wrong. Look at Twitter, Zynga  
t1_dt4lvqv	1	*	Right. Unless your lifespan's a week, in which case it might be desirable.
t1_dt3vixg	1	*	Johnny's family has converted all of their money to Venezuelan bolxedvar. Johnny's family networth is now 48269360.02 bolivar.
t1_dtc5dza	0	*	That's bullshit then. A sub cannot have free comments when they actively ban users and delete their comments if it's against the libertarian ideology.
t1_dt2l9fw	0	*	Oh hey! My favorite pro-russian troll! It's funny how your name shows up to defend Russia in every single thread on reddit.
t1_dt2j4cm	0	*	Wow 
t1_dtx8i8b	0	*	Ok Ill give you the two options.  Nukes that killed about 100,000 people  or an invasion that risked killing millions.  Also its still less people than died in the firebombs of tokyo.   
t1_dtxxmil	1	*	I hear a comet wiped out all the dinosaurs! Crazy times back then.
t1_dtxao5z	1	*	So why were Libya and Syria at risk then? Or Iraq and Afghanistan?  Bush named them as part of the Axis of Evil and then invaded two countries on his list. You bet they got the message.
t1_dtu8sj5	1	*	I'd like to know it but it's not worth telling the rest of the world.
t1_dtu871z	0	*	Away and take your mouth out for a shite 
t1_dtu4kx4	0	*	Look at the world around us and tell me that would be a negative development.
t1_dtvur5f	1	*	It would fly I guess
t1_dtu5ex0	1	*	I, for one, think we should be generous with our polonium.
t1_dtujc1s	1	*	Please go look up the twitter messages between Donald Trump Jr. and Wikileaks. That is all. 
t1_dun05oe	1	*	/r/politics can be stupid but it's stupid to claim it's anything like the mindless hate/propoganda cult that is t_d
t1_dumsv58	0	*	Sometimes I see someone post something so perplexing or vituperative I check their comment history for context. Finding a wall of shitposts on TD in someone's history generally explains a lot to me.
t1_dun0f1s	1	*	Very true, stick to that. 
t1_dtfyq46	0	*	AS you can see by your down votes, /r/worldnews is the new place where the alt-right gathers to brigade chit.
t1_dt7onoa	0	*	Why are you so in denial of reality? Are you a butthurt TSA agent or something? Is one of your relatives?
t1_ds19816	0	*	So no humanitarian reasons come to mind? Like not letting fellow human beings be left out in the cold?
t1_dttfdv1	1	*	Quit trying so hard.  We never declared war on North Korea.  Trump has no legal way to do so.
t1_dsv1ybn	0	*	Response: Yes.
t1_dsupcid	0	*	There are several crypto currencies with deep ties to the Chinese government. VeChain, Walton Chain, NEO and more.  
t1_dv2injv	0	*	In Arizona there's this stereotype of the heavily armed Christian conservative.  That holster (yes, all my own leatherwork) was my way of saying yeah, that's not what I is :).
t1_dv2m4lc	1	*	Just say the word: racist. You don't have to be nice and use words like xenophobic. We need to call these people out for what they are. 
t1_dv2kgcb	1	*	Maybe we'd be more willing to believe that he wasn't a Russian stooge if he didn't suck Putins cock at every opportunity and refuse to enact sanctions that were almost universally supported. 
t1_dv2bbe1	0	*	Umm can i move to Maine?
t1_dv2d329	1	*	People can add whatever they want onto that project
t1_dv3mp05	0	*	Swing and a miss. Fascism has a very specific definition.

t1_dv2he0c	0	*	Or some people might admire his role in the revolution. 
t1_dv2dznl	0	*	You should probably visit r/conservative or the_ Donald. Its the Reddit way through and through 
t1_dv2izxy	0	*	totally, that's why the CGI foundation folded after the money from foreign dictatorships dried up after the election. 
t1_dv2n670	1	*	Corporations pay a tax matching what their employees pay on wages.    6.2 social security and 1.45 Medicaid.   This is the tax that is particularly difficult for mom and pop shops.  
t1_dv3auqm	1	*	Just like how they're switching now. Before they feared Russians, now they're welcoming them.
t1_dv2krkg	1	*	No problem
t1_dv2di4p	1	*	I mean....youre kind of proving him right though. An emotional rant instead of a logical argument. 
t1_dv2ignh	1	*	Bruh, even our media is sensationalising it. Gotta get those click throughs somehow. 
t1_dv2l7an	0	*	Why would you care about those issues if you're a European? 
t1_dv2dg8f	1	*	Another t_D mouth-breather.
t1_dv2i3t3	1	*	I often suggested that I could go to a Tea Party rally, *or* an Occupy rally, wave around a sign that said Down With Up and I'd get some folks to gather around me.
t1_dv7bmwa	1	*	What does being Jewish have to do with this?
t1_dv2g86n	0	*	Farmers are going to have their farms stolen by the government is what that guy just said
t1_dv2dbhl	1	*	Maskholes
t1_dv2fwu0	1	*	Yeah, I'm not big on any sort of nationalisation myself, but the whole thing is being framed as SA kicks out the whites and takes their shit, which is just grossly misinformed. 
t1_dv2urhg	0	*	Whatabout the left, amirite?  Did the left ever enact or fail to enforce policies, the net effect of which was to benefit Russia, based on such money? 
t1_dv2gm6y	0	*	Yup. The whole dog whistle thing is very overused, but in this case it's quite apt. 
t1_dv2izfb	0	*	What? Many Republicans support all of those statements, not only one of them.
t1_dv2h00d	1	*	Lol the most successful capitalists can get loans from banks in the US. Trump can't.
t1_dv2f734	1	*	Fantasy utopia? Im for it, but something is standing the way - Republicans, no, reality.
t1_dv2nqrw	0	*	So what would you call it if a foreign entity said pssst, NRA,  can you get this $100k to the Trump campaign for me??  Because thats whats being alleged.
t1_dv2m0bj	0	*	Then why are a majority of mass shootings done with a rifle??
t1_dv2tas0	1	*	That sounds great if you don't have a high school education and get your news from Facebook.
t1_dv2gin6	1	*	You don't even have a point. You are essentially rolling your eyes using words.
t1_dv2frlx	0	*	Hey man give it time for us to fix it. Realize like 65% of the country didn't vote for this
t1_dujol5n	0	*	Which this post does not under this subreddit but it's still here.

t1_dujk0xv	1	*	Yeah shes married. Shes Mike Huckabees daughter and she married a dude whos last name is Sanders. Then she hyphened her name.
t1_dujr1fy	1	*	This is totally false
t1_dul8vkj	1	*	name a ceo worth a billion dollars or more that is fun to work for. i can't. but i work for one because i get paid well to do so. can't argue with a solid pay check
t1_dujixc7	1	*	Buddy I'll have you know I went to trump university, I know all about those cunning nambians. Must have missed the Measians, was probably having my lobotomy.
t1_dujylxs	1	*	What if JFK was the hero of time and this is the fallen hero timeline?
t1_duk6bzy	1	*	Fair point well made.
t1_dujm90a	1	*	Woop woop that's the sound a' tha police!  Watch the words... lord knows you don't want to get taken away because someone's not smart enough to realize you're speaking in metaphor.

t1_duk630z	1	*	Great!  So you're saying there's plenty of time left, right?
t1_dujjwvl	0	*	Are we pre-judging folks based on the sins of the father and brother today? Tough to keep track sometimes.
t1_dujqm77	1	*	I've never met Putin  Trump supporter: seems legit
t1_dujq529	1	*	This is what reddit used to be like.
t1_dujqndp	1	*	The GOP assemblies in most red states have vastly defunded education. 
t1_dujzzbr	1	*	I know, I had high hopes for hilarious hijinx when The Mooch was hired. I think Donald just didnt want somekne else upstaging him.
t1_dujolep	1	*	Grow up, buddy. 
t1_duk7xfj	0	*	Fair enough. But I don't think the US should put sanctions of Russia, I think the US government should leave them alone.
t1_dujkbha	1	*	Brilliant. 
t1_dujorph	0	*	When does the game come out? 
t1_dujjetf	0	*	He has the best words. 
t1_dujp1hp	1	*	I dont think anyones accusing Putin of trolling reddit or hacking email servers personally. Russia is quite clearly a byword for the Russian government or those working on their behalf.
t1_dujoj74	1	*	I like the matryoshka brain concept, a paradise for billions if not trillions of years...
t1_dujt7md	0	*	I wouldn't call it revisionist history if a large chunk of the world recognizes it as history. It's just history for some people. 
t1_dujkdax	0	*	Oh fuck, just realized shes one of those Huckabees. Didnt think my opinion could go lower and there it is. 
t1_dujrt07	1	*	she's a proud owner of resting bitch face (RBF)
t1_dujkf4v	1	*	In fact, it was satire, so it was really supposed to be more of a how-and-why-NOT-to guide. 
t1_dujnxsv	1	*	I had wondered where the stench of bullshit was coming from.
t1_dujpy8n	0	*	> He almost got away with it too!  If it weren't for those meddlin' kids!  Wait, no
t1_duk0b2g	0	*	Should news sources strive to be like them?

t1_duke9cq	0	*	If you're a CEO you either have a contract deal or you yourself own a majority share of the company.
t1_dujny0c	1	*	Yeah well so do all the others youve denigrated. And that last part would be a pretty thorough waste of your time, so, ok.
t1_dujiw7r	1	*	Still could do better than that
t1_dujx3i8	0	*	Joe Biden is ready.  
t1_dujnuhe	0	*	Were the Russians indicted for the podesta emails and the DNC leaks, or were they indicted for posting memes and spreading mainstream media articles before and after the election?
t1_dujktqm	0	*	> Trump: I believe Putin 01:31 STORY HIGHLIGHTS He said he didn't meddle,  
t1_dujyxk2	1	*	Why would they need more than one? Especially to no longer give charitable interpretations to him on this topic.
t1_dujlpep	0	*	> What do you do?  Quit? Tell him that you won't say it nor defend it if he says it himself. 
t1_dujt2xb	1	*	And now he says he never said such a thing, which is a lie. That is the whole point of this article. 
t1_dujk01o	1	*	> been tryin for **years** and still can't find anything haha  Are you from the future? Do you drive a DeLorean? 
t1_duk7dbi	1	*	Theyre just trying to rationalize being played by Trump as a good thing.  Admitting youve been taken advantage of is difficult to do when its this bad.   
t1_dukcw7w	0	*	Spicer's still working within the administration.  He just tweeted an attaboy to DT.  Not sure how he has the moral high ground?
t1_dujtfsv	1	*	Dont move the goalposts here - the topic itt is if Trump denied that Russians meddled - not that Trump committed a crime - and Obama is as relevant to this conversation as David Letterman is. 
t1_dujsp9d	0	*	the exact text of the tweet OP posted about was I never said Russia did not meddle in the election. Claiming the DNC hacked themselves is would mean... it wasn't russia. 
t1_dujzw4c	1	*	This is not what he has done. The fucking moron can't/won't read the intelligence reports. 
t1_dujiqzc	0	*	People had bills to pay/beaver pelts to collect before the Boston Tea Party too.   But that was a different time I suppose.
t1_dujr8b1	1	*	wait, its unamerican to follow our democratic system instead of impeaching someone because you dont like him? 
t1_duk65yc	1	*	*record scratch* Yeah, that's me.  You might be wondering how I got here.

t1_dujsf36	1	*	Well thanks for admitting that, I mean it. I'll also admit that this article has a lot of misleading quotes.
t1_dujvpg8	1	*	So salty. 
t1_duk5kbe	0	*	Because t_d is still around, and it's still embarrassing.   Who says I can't poke at the president? Donald J. Trump is a corny asshole and a fraud.
t1_dujljsv	1	*	This sounds like the trailer for a docu-movie about his Press Secretary days 
t1_dujkj8g	0	*	I mean... we could've NOT voted for him. That would've been kinda chill I think 
t1_dujmozo	1	*	Listen to the Slow Burn podcast by slate covering watergate. That basically was how it was back then. Nixon had 25% approval after bloody Saturday..
t1_dujnjs8	0	*	Word for word.
t1_dukr90k	1	*	*See*!
t1_dujsnpa	1	*	What has Trump done about this? What has Trump done to prevent this from happening again in November?
t1_duju0qw	1	*	Thank you for enlightening me, I'll let you know you changed my opinion kind sir
t1_dujl2nq	0	*	It is a fact that nearly all the states at the bottom of education rankings are consistently Republican. You saying there are a few outliers contributes nothing. 
t1_dtinos1	1	*	Charlie Wilson's War. Good movie.

t1_duge0p6	0	*	I believe it is an anesthetic used in surgery?
t1_dtj4i8q	1	*	I wasn't trying to imply that it was any sort of real solution.  Just throwing it out there.  It sounds awful.
t1_dtj378s	0	*	He doesn't have a foreskin though, he very clearly mentioned that in his post.
t1_dtjjw8o	1	*	I think the best method is to just . remove the brain, then they can't even think about masturbating
t1_dtjlqc3	1	*	It's a good thing we developed tools before our dangerous penis shape really held us back.
t1_dtj8jcw	0	*	Do you have evidence that all or even a majority of the circumcisions performed in the US are medically motivated?
t1_dtkufs7	0	*	No, why would it? Less labia = less to clean.  
t1_dtj63r8	1	*	Zwarte Piet is not religious at all.
t1_dtkvnz7	1	*	Well duh don't put it up the bum stick to kitties
t1_dtkftzi	1	*	my uncut is so sensitive sex almost hurts :/
t1_dtjpgm6	1	*	Exactly. It is just a stigma propagated by ignorant people. As is becomes less and less common that stigma will vanish. 
t1_dtkfxao	1	*	labia majora sounds like a disease
t1_dtpg5yy	0	*	As a boy. According to a doctor I saw it counts as within the range of successful outcomes.   It is irreparable, except by foreskin restoration, and thats only a partial fix. 
t1_dtlf7gx	0	*	People are critical of the argument I'm happy with my circumcised penis so I'm going to do the same to my kid regardless of what benefits there are. 
t1_dtjnl67	0	*	Its their child, theyre not yours. Your conviction or whatever righteous thoughts you have doesnt have anything on them.  Sounds like youve never had any responsibilities whatsoever. 
t1_dtje03l	0	*	Mostly the latter. If you have children, you should choose how you want to raise them. This is a meaningless body modification, it shouldn't be illegal.
t1_dtkvfuq	1	*	No, thankfully. Personally I wouldn't want to.  I like the down votes for stating a fact though. Not everyone is able to think rationally I guess.  xaf\\\_()_/xaf
t1_dtjevng	0	*	Sexuallu deviant tendencies!  What the fuck are you on about?
t1_dtk7yyg	0	*	The Canadian government recommends against circumcision unless it is medically necessary so thats a start.
t1_dtkq015	0	*	Someone won't get a second date if their foreskin is too 'extreme'?! That's one of the weirder things I've read on Reddit in while.
t1_dtqv3ri	1	*	It makes no difference to cleaning. It's not like you have to really get in there, it pulls back with no effort.

t1_dtj4l72	0	*	[Dam son](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/971/686/891.jpg). You told him.             Only thing that would make your argument stronger is if you can source some of it.
t1_dtjo1k9	0	*	Really? Those exact ones? I doubt that.
t1_dtl37u9	0	*	Aww, poor baby. It's a comment. Get over it.
t1_dtk9blq	0	*	You're clearly not talking about the pitted, scarred, desensitised downward-bending gonzo-wangs that circumcision commonly causes.  It's not pretty.
t1_dtjk6j3	0	*	:/ really?
t1_dtj77zs	0	*	Cutting off your ears will massively reduce the rate of cancer and cauliflower ear on your ears.
t1_dtipu0x	1	*	You dont understand how penises work do you?
t1_dtjq53k	1	*	Yeah, my ex thought about it because being uncircumcised caused him problems, but having to give up on sex for weeks didn't make it worth it.
t1_dtkh23e	1	*	My only issue with it is the lack of consent for children who have it done.   If people want it done in adult life then go for it
t1_dtjo1hg	1	*	I too am circumcised and beating my meat/sex feels great!   That being said, I hate hearing about the people who were circumcised and now have low sensitivity. That sucks and Im sorry.
t1_dtjbbzm	0	*	Except it can be for medical reasons.
t1_dtj6vf7	0	*	I wash my dick, kthx
t1_dtjftwn	1	*	Why would you ask someone who may regret something if they needed to do it? What possible good can come of that? Damn 
t1_dtjg6ys	1	*	Yeah man, I'm cut and none of my partners have mentioned it. I think a big part of this debate is guys being  super self conscious about their dick.

t1_dtserzo	0	*	I know you did, and I agree that it's a useful technique, but I'm saying it can also be used to kill rational viewpoints, and is therefore dangerous to rely on.
t1_dtqbsnb	0	*	The point is that parliament can chose to ignore the referendum. They are not obligated to follow the results, especially with such a very small margin.
t1_dtq1qf9	1	*	I agree!
t1_dtrla91	0	*	Do you read the news?
t1_dt27adv	0	*	Is it? Syndicalism is about moving power from governments to job-specific unions. Doesn't sound a lot like direct democracy or autonomous technocracy.

t1_ds4ztaq	1	*	The problem with your insane thought here is that only one side really supports our constitutional right to maintain the ability to stage one and theyre the ones that keep winning elections 
t1_ds46yqi	0	*	Welcome to Costco, I love you bigly.
t1_ds4h57c	0	*	What? You are not helping your case mate, I do sincerely believe trump is not a genius as you claim and is just really a moron.

t1_ds4efd7	1	*	Oh THAT Kim. Lost context for a minute. 
t1_dsbzkio	0	*	Fair enough. I was just going by what that particular study said about richest country.

t1_dsbozae	1	*	I expect wizards. With the hat and everything.

t1_dsbeaul	1	*	We take risks all the time.  I'd take nuclear.
t1_dsbh4vr	1	*	I have not, but will look into it. I would also say that would work in reverse as well, high intelligence and awareness could cause one to feel superior and this above moral obligation. 
t1_dsbdqor	0	*	People in mining towns never talked about the mines going belly up either.  People in mill towns never talk about what theyd do if a forest fire came through.

t1_dt4k329	1	*	Yeah, IF you eat the brain AND that person is infected. So real chances? Low. Come on man, you know we'd all be eating ass cheeks and sweet meats. 
t1_dt2zqjd	1	*	...yes, all the coal that would be exported is now still in the country. If anything their coal supply has increased because of the sanctions.
t1_dt44fkw	1	*	Yep... Hallowed are the Ori!
t1_duncr15	1	*	Thats improper prescribing, not the kind of thing this study is advocating. 
t1_duodp87	0	*	I think so. Good discussion

t1_dv1qynb	0	*	Whats your point?   I dont see how this has anything to do with what I said.
t1_dv2bbxl	1	*	I don't understand why your being downvoted, it says right in the article that which countries the tariff would hit, had still not been finalized. 
t1_dv2qt3b	1	*	Interesting.  Thankyou for the perspective. 
t1_dv206s0	0	*	That is true for many contracts, but that just shifts the losses on to the supplier.
t1_dv201bd	1	*	> They could have just given subsidies to US Steel and not fucked us all over.  Whoa now buddy that sounds like positive reinforcement!
t1_dv1ownd	0	*	yeah, but he's only talking about taking the lib's guns tho
t1_dv1saqt	1	*	This is not a bailout, it is to protect against international dumping and subsidies for foreign steel (Chynuh)
t1_dv51es6	1	*	And pre-washed coal.
t1_dv1usl6	1	*	Maybe you should be a personal stylist or something. It sound like you really enjoy fashion and hairdressing. 
t1_dv1jy1r	1	*	That figure is false. You're spreading misinformation.
t1_dv26ors	1	*	Canadian here. He's fine.
t1_dv1qdpc	1	*	McConnel and Ryan would sell the American public for votes, China is really good at evaluating greedy cowards to target.
t1_dv1o61g	0	*	Because your vote should not count more just because you have more land. 
t1_dv2gykp	1	*	dayum
t1_dv1tyiu	1	*	Thats truth right there
t1_dv1ypsk	1	*	This Mueller checkmate shit is getting so old. It's honestly turning into some worship, like the_donald for dems. Already been seeing Mueller playing 4d chess posts... 
t1_dv1qe7l	1	*	Ease up, we don't want him to go nuclear. 
t1_dv1xbjd	0	*	That's not a nice way to talk about your grammas breasts

t1_dv2f9ug	0	*	Still haven't told me how much of the car's price is steel
t1_dv283vr	1	*	So, that's ixnay on targeting US offshore money storage.
t1_dv26c8n	1	*	China is loving this. Russia must be legit getting favours from China for the stuff they've done and the heat they are taking. 
t1_dv2he2k	1	*	whoever that isn't US?
t1_dv1zsx6	1	*	So Trump is Sidious and is trying to kill all the jedi?  And order 66 is actually 66 per cent tariff on everything?
t1_dv1z6sf	1	*	Just switch to titanium 
t1_dv3d3j6	0	*	It was downvoted because Trudeau fans can't accept that his trip to India was a disaster.
t1_dv1rqca	0	*	This sort of us vs them mentality is exactly the kind of thinking that got us into this political shit show in the first place. 
t1_dv1uzmu	0	*	> They could have just given subsidies to US Steel  Socialism!!!
t1_dv2fwk2	1	*	I personally find it hard to believe that trump even knows what due process means.
t1_dv1vzxd	1	*	Does that count as election tampering? Im confused.... 
t1_dv22l0n	1	*	The common wealthy would back us I'd imagine. And then basically any country that doesn't like America. I feel like it would be the world against America.
t1_dv3m02c	1	*	No need for appologies. On the whole you were absolutely right and I said so. I just wanted to highlight the effects on the micro scale though too
t1_dv1plrk	0	*	Maybe they should target some Trump hotels
t1_dv1sj3i	0	*	Whats your company? Got a link?

t1_dv1xlom	1	*	Working on it
t1_dv1wbaj	0	*	What a madlad
t1_dv1o3ah	1	*	Yes, maple *flavored* syrup is not maple syrup. I live in the U.S. and specifically buy actual maple syrup, it's so worth it.
t1_dv1web7	0	*	Oh no. His shit is everywhere.
t1_dv1zsjt	0	*	Do you have a source for those figures?  The ones Ive seen seem to suggest the opposite. 
t1_dv2abei	0	*	The only irony here is how blind you are to your own tribalism.
t1_dv1w5hv	1	*	Subsidies sound bad. Tariffs can be made to pretend they protect American jobs.  Anyone who took ECON 101 will tell you tariffs are pure BS.
t1_dv2jfk8	1	*	How is this not interfering in US politics? Surely this is more effective than a bunch of russian trolls. 
t1_dv23cww	1	*	ASEAN is not that poor at all, except for Cambodia and Laos
t1_dv2yblm	1	*	hah you tariff like a girl America!
t1_dv39ck8	1	*	I'm sure he'll do it in blackface too so Fox News can spin it as Obama coming and taking them.
t1_dv1r7wb	1	*	And enrich already wealthy capitalists!
t1_dv1u8e9	1	*	We're talking efficiency, not freedom
t1_dv1rf6o	1	*	I laughed, you win.
t1_dv2ya20	1	*	Does not matter if the EU tarrifs industries his friends who paid to put him into office owns. They will put the screws on him the second he starts losing them money. 
t1_dv1ig36	0	*	Yeah, I think u/Abedeus has his prejudice showing a little bit.
t1_dv1weoo	0	*	Wow...what an intelligent, thoughtful comment. Thanks.
t1_dv1f30h	0	*	Anything to protect the US? 
t1_dv1pg3v	0	*	Yeah, like good ol NAFTA really helped the US Manufacturing sector 
t1_dv1u70v	0	*	> The deals that are made without us will have far less less impact.   Wow.  That's hilariously wrong, and you apparently don't seem to understand why.  
t1_dv1ssl2	0	*	Well, in certain circles it is.  But generally cold heading isn't a topic that comes up often. 
t1_dv21ll4	1	*	What else did she say about Trump supporters in that statement? And how does that paint you?
t1_dv228fq	0	*	So you're defending it? Liberals are in such a weird place ideologically right now...  God capitalism sucks.. but Trump is taking anti-free trade stances so bring on that exploitation!
t1_dv1ryot	1	*	Fear and loathing.
t1_dv1wlh6	1	*	It didn't.  Automation did.
t1_dv2049z	0	*	He just described how it works.  You offer no counter argument.
t1_dv1than	1	*	Thanks.
t1_dv1yyza	1	*	The reason for that is China only exports low-grade steel, the high quality stuff is reserved for domestic use. 
t1_dv1suop	0	*	Who said the EU will impose tariffs?
t1_dv1oxvm	0	*	Does he look like a Bitch?
t1_dv1zzfm	0	*	Canada was British then. 
t1_dv1mruh	1	*	Yeah, all jokes aside, hemp is a fantastic material.
t1_dv1te94	1	*	Indeed. I remember him saying he benefited from 2007/8 recession. I thought you were saying he advocated for a new one. Cheers. 
t1_dv20dti	1	*	Trudeau not so popular at home lately after his Bollywood dressed dance shenanigans 
t1_dv23xys	1	*	KFC, Ketchup, Well-some Steak
t1_dv20cp0	1	*	Trudeau is NOT popular over here lol. Even the most liberal of liberals I know don't like him anymore. Trudeau won because he wasn't Harper.
t1_dv2snol	1	*	Trudeau is not that popular. 
t1_dv1th5f	1	*	you just explained why H1b visas for tech jobs exist ie you would have plenty of tech Phd's if you were willing to pay some approximation of what they are worth to your business
t1_dv1rb5r	0	*	You should read the subredditdrama thread about this. The mods in r/t_d banned a ton of loyal, regular posters in that Reddit for saying that Trump was wrong to attack guns. 
t1_dv1ov77	1	*	Thanks for the info. Can't wait for the primary
t1_dv2ith7	1	*	Hmmm not sure tbh
t1_dv29i32	0	*	Norwegian style deal aka being EUs bitch with no say in anything. I'd rather see us as a full EU member.

t1_dv23z3u	1	*	Great and just when grain prices were starting to get better....
t1_dv1woa6	1	*	So... does some other state want to take Detroit? I doubt we cast a single vote for him and Michigan mostly hates us.
t1_dv1myhk	1	*	But you have Trudeau. Which isnt an insult Im just stating a fact Im jealous
t1_dv1ob9r	0	*	I don't think trump cares he has already become president probably bored of it now why do it for 8 years?
t1_dv2bayl	1	*	google pgh and youll find yourself taken to the pittsburgh wikipedia page. idk why they do, i just know some people from there and they always say pgh. 
t1_dv2e91m	1	*	nice theory
t1_dv3mpce	1	*	True.
t1_dv22buq	0	*	The American democracy has at least, I HOPE figured out the ramifications of voting for a leader for the lulz.
t1_dv26f00	0	*	. Trump couldnt even succeed in not bankrupting a casino. And you support trump so your opinion literally worthless and he world is a worse place wih you in it.
t1_dt642g7	0	*	Some are, sure. There are more anarchist tendencies than an-com, not to mention. Regardless, if these anarchists just want more social programs, then they aren't really anarchists. 
t1_dt5ulsb	0	*	If I give every homeless guy a meal but at the same time punch him in the face it's also benefitting. Doesn't mean it's how it should be.
t1_dt0mnft	0	*	OR it's understanding how people became crazy and stopping THAT before it occurs again. 
t1_dt0fhw3	0	*	Oh we dont? And we dont have thousand if not millions of civilian casualties on our hands either?
t1_dt185wn	0	*	That's an argument you've made up. I've never heard a politician give that explanation for the death penalty for terrorism. And it's not even the reason other people in the thread here give either.
t1_dt0zkl9	1	*	Some people would get off on the punishment...
t1_dt0ss0l	1	*	I did...   And what I've described would indeed be a bit similar to the Miniluv.   My point was that treating religious fanatics like mentally ill people would be an extreme reaction.
t1_dt0qrrk	0	*	> The reason we execute terrorists is because  the executions drive terrorist recruitment, further enabling the justification of increased military spending.
t1_dt1y1e8	1	*	It is almost as if people don't bother, nor care, to read thousands of comments and just comments on the ones they see!
t1_dt0sp2a	1	*	In the first world capital punishment costs more than just keeping them locked up for the rest of their lives.
t1_dt0sgme	1	*	Death is really not important to me in terms of punishment, (edit:) because once your dead, your dead. Punishment can only be applied to living beings. 
t1_dt1hm9m	1	*	Infidollars
t1_dt0osbv	1	*	For sure see the Tide pod challenge
t1_dt0qez7	1	*	Idk when you go and kill other countries citizens you kind of have to respect that persons decision. 
t1_dt12rzl	0	*	Im worried about her talking to others. And theyre not allowed to confine you indefinitely anymore unfortunately 
t1_dt0swgk	1	*	Wheres that video of the kid who joined ISIS that got executed? That was a good one.
t1_dt1e79i	0	*	That's a trivial distinction. Either way you're executing (ie: killing in cold blood for no good reason) someone, which is wrong.
t1_dt1dyns	1	*	Execution is wrong whether it's done by ISIS, Iraq or the USA. The death penalty is barbaric and should be abolished.
t1_dt0zudj	1	*	But you can plop them on top of mines and watch the bits. 
t1_dt0jhp1	1	*	Its worth it for my freedom. Its like surveillance, if i did nothing wrong I have nothing to fear about.   /s
t1_dug9xwv	0	*	They've probably contributed more to this country than every Trump voter combined. But that's just an educated guess.
t1_dugcfz2	1	*	FFS. Yep, that obviously refutes my point.   Edit: Is responding like that just for show, or are you really convinced?
t1_dugeupv	0	*	How about any laws passed by Congress since he took office
t1_dugkbew	0	*	If there's no more coming in after we BUILD THE WALL, that would be a pretty good price!
t1_dugfwb6	0	*	Why does it have to do with religion? Their government have showed time and time again that they had the potential to do that kind of stuff lol
t1_dughd1i	0	*	I'm saying that virtue signaling In lieu of actually doing something to help the people you supposedly care about is pretty hypocritical of you.  Kony 2012, mate!
t1_duggdjp	1	*	they could take them in and make use of them since most societies need low level laborers 
t1_dugfa73	0	*	My GF had told me it was only Jews but Arabs could volunteer- she was in the IDF now an Israeli-American

t1_duga3n1	0	*	It's not spin .. that's what happens. Spinning would be saying we give Israel millions of dollars!
t1_dug8i24	1	*	Hey buddy use your noggin. The race is Ethiopian. Jew in this context is a religious designation, if you have an orthodox conversion you too can go be a citizen of Israel. 
t1_dugdxud	0	*	Now you just sound insane. Provide any proof.
t1_dugcrvz	0	*	I know. I assumed it was a [Game of Thrones reference/joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y7TosK1OvQ).
t1_dugceqf	0	*	That's true. But its implied in migrant - that's European-talk for economic migrant who isn't a refugee. Its what Americans call an illegal alien. 
t1_dugh562	0	*	The difference is these people do not live in Israel they are illegal immigrants, israel could toss them out with no help at all. This is a great move by Israel. 
t1_dugevrq	1	*	I would believe American tourists bring a lot of money into the country by consuming stuff and paying for it.
t1_dugc06h	1	*	You should hold the sum total of humanity to a higher standard. I don't care if they are a first or third world country, they should get their shit together.
t1_duho8iv	0	*	Yeah, Israel's purpose is so different from what you just proposed that its actually comical
t1_dt056qc	1	*	Defrimichzeis

t1_dsv0yah	1	*	She wouldn't need to put her name on it.
t1_dulstaz	0	*	isn't it due to out competing them through more advanced tool use? i would imagine otherwise it would be like us deciding to enter a boxing match with a gorilla.
t1_duc4y45	1	*	I'd say there's only a handful of countries that doesn't come out as shitholes when compared to Sweden. 
t1_dubz6rg	0	*	> At least it is a better culture, especially if you are trying to raise a kid.  You need to expand on that, because it's pretty bold statement

t1_dskig4x	1	*	Says the one defending a megalomaniac imbecile...
t1_dsksds1	0	*	The US is a great place if you are born into affluency.  The system makes it impossible for 99/100 born in poverty to climb out.  And the level of crime rich people can get away with is mind boggling.

t1_dtziijh	0	*	Try to kill an animal and eat it using only your claws and teeth. Maybe then you'll realize how stupid your point is.
t1_dtzlzwg	1	*	Yup. My boyfriend and I save meat for the weekend and special occasions. And I rarely eat beef, partly because I don't like it and it's the worst environmentally.
t1_dtzug0m	1	*	And the enormous demand exerting pressure on the people running these places
t1_dtznuko	0	*	I read a few years ago that it's illegal in Wyoming (I think?) to report illegal dumping on public land.  Boy do I feel represented by these asshats.

t1_dsquwmg	0	*	Fair enough.  Looking back at this I thought he was talking about u/daedalusesq who seems much more than a layman
t1_dsq0s3v	1	*	No it waits until the grid can accept the power and discharges to the grid.
t1_dspko6s	0	*	Austria!? Throw another shrimp on the Bar-b, eh mate!
t1_dtdx5sn	0	*	that's literally what eminent domain is. most countries have some form of it
t1_dunpjxl	0	*	That case is just the tip of the iceberg.
t1_dt0j70h	1	*	Somehow I think if we worked at it we could at least match the most inefficient nations on earth on healthcare if we worked at it. 
t1_dszi9x8	0	*	Israel being in the Sinai is what caused that though, to be clear. 
t1_dsz1n40	0	*	how? the usa is in a much higher place than egypt.

t1_dsz9odv	1	*	Russia was the first to land on the moon in 1959.    Amazing how Americans don't know about this. 
t1_dszcoqr	0	*	I'd value a quality teacher over quite a few other six figure professions, so agree to disagree?
t1_dsyymjr	0	*	If you walk up to a restaurant and theres a mandatory $60 tip for the doorman, but once inside any single meal is without cost, would you consider that free?
t1_dsz2e4p	1	*	And when Sandra Fluke decries not having 'access to birthcontrol' because someone won't buy it for her. It's always a word game and you're doing the same thing here. 
t1_dsyz6ce	1	*	The canal used to be owned by the US, maybe he thought it still was?
t1_dszky08	1	*	Now, will you two please apologise!
t1_dszu7zs	1	*	I know. Never understood it. Vision is also separate. Just weird policies I guess.
t1_dsza68k	1	*	What does a doctor's requirement to provide medical care to patients have to do with Americans having access to doctor's? IDK man I can't figure it out..
t1_dsz8w47	1	*	Yeah that sounds about right 
t1_dszdp32	1	*	Well most students are still under their parents health plan, but the ones who aren't eligible to go that route almost always take the university option.
t1_dsyys62	0	*	Read the comment chain. Were talking about how healthcare and health coverage are two different (but related) things. 
t1_dsz0fkz	0	*	> I know this from personal experience.  [Anecdotal evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence). 
t1_dsz5nz8	1	*	Well like most great paying jobs the screening process will have to be more diligent. Like the status of a doctor or lawyer..
t1_dszga46	1	*	Mexico is #1 for obesity
t1_dsz8329	0	*	You're just moving the goalposts. None of that is entirely relevant to the OP I responded to. 
t1_dsz6a53	1	*	> They're a quite wealthy country with a small population?   That would be a recipe for obesity like the other countries. They're not that wealthy.  > They've got loads of oil and gas  Not a lot.   
t1_dsznfvj	1	*	Were #1 for worlds dumbest leaders too. 
t1_dszf719	1	*	France is #1 at whining it's our national sport
t1_dt0d81f	1	*	Probably not true.  There are something like 800,000 people registered in OHIP than even live in Ontario for example.  But on per capita basis, you might be right.
t1_dsz2jbi	1	*	>Is person who read the article from the top comment   FTFY
t1_dszevlb	0	*	She's no longer on this, but it was First Health.
t1_dsyzzvr	0	*	Idk what tbis comment means. We dont have anything close to a free market.
t1_dsz1w0t	1	*	Most of those 7% were not by choice either. The individual mandate forced them on
t1_dszfkm6	1	*	58% of the population is *not* universal.
t1_dsyxer6	1	*	And how many of them have to check their account balance before calling an ambulance?
t1_du8dl5o	1	*	What about the fact that the definition of minor varies from country to country?
t1_duqe6i1	1	*	Yeah, I see now I didnt understand how deep the problem was. Ill do more research on it, my bad!
t1_duq7su8	1	*	> wasnt fair to Russian athletes who hadnt violated doping rules  Do such people even exist?
t1_dupzypy	0	*	I really hadn't noticed. I'm just a stickler for tradition. 
t1_dzk4zvz	1	*	And WADA testing is a bit of a sham anyways
t1_duqkib5	1	*	Wow, the jump from Russia to second place is even bigger than I expected
t1_duq6xhy	0	*	Yeah. Obviously with hindsight we can make more clear assumptions about what would have been better or not.  But without knowing, which is the better reaction?  
t1_duqdyb2	1	*	Thanks for not treating me like a dumbass for not understanding this, haha. Ill check Icarus out, thanks! 
t1_duqj3pl	0	*	Well yea, I mean, he won, you cant beat that. Eternal champion.

t1_dtqzqp0	1	*	lol, if you say so.
t1_dtr9dcc	1	*	And MNCs profit handsomely from the deals. There is nothing free about it, rather it was a highly lucrative win-win deal for both sides. The original poster was being absurd. 
t1_dtqtoi6	0	*	You are ignorant of higher educational business practices.   It is well known in the industry that full-pay international students help to keep tuition affordable for local students.
t1_dtqv7a5	0	*	Before 1959
t1_dtr9gmy	0	*	Yeah. Very difficult. Better start a revolution since thats much more realistic. 
t1_dtr9xry	1	*	My country does not lack skilled doctors. My country's healthcare system is fucked up by insurance companies taking all the federal subsidies.   
t1_dtqsqdr	0	*	Tibet was never ruled by he British
t1_dtqsvdx	0	*	Got it, you don't understand how your own public systems work. Thanks for clearing that up!
t1_dv5m1k2	0	*	If you think china depends on America to feed their citizens debate is already over.
t1_dsree2g	1	*	> Why does free trade HAVE to mean freedom of movement?  Because the EU wants it, will not budge on it, and the UK has no chips to play.
t1_dsrcdr3	1	*	also , much of the difference in crime compared to the 90s was drug related, the shift in focus onto the suppliers rather than users made the numbers appear to fall alot. 
t1_dsruyre	1	*	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/16/eu-leaders-say-uk-can-reverse-brexit-decision-if-it-wants-to
t1_dsr6h6l	1	*	That's an easy choice, fuck the country.
t1_dsripi6	0	*	The EU brexit negotiation team which the EU has empowered to make these decisions has stated this clearly and unequivocally. 
t1_dsrdd7i	1	*	>you'd rather they flip a coin and take a guess  I think using the old coin flip trick would have been a good way to go. Flip for it and see how the result makes you feel.
t1_dssn0uw	1	*	Dunning-Kruger effect.
t1_dsr916g	1	*	Sir you seem to have placed a slope here. A slipperly one at that.
t1_dsrfjf1	1	*	Wow this some really high level trolling you really got my jimmies rustled do you really think anyone would fall for that shite effort.
t1_ds3x9ur	0	*	Will eating lab created human tissues make people cannibals?
t1_dudykmg	1	*	I unfortunately must agree
t1_dtsgdjl	1	*	It's usually amoxicillin that they prescribe (which is based on penicillin so allergic to that too) not sure if they still prescribe straight penicillin or if they're all derivatives. 
t1_dts8qxz	0	*	Well, if you keep jailing drug addicts, instead of treating it like what it is, **an illness**, then yes, you are disincentivizing them to seek treatment.
t1_dts5cyt	1	*	U.S. has a lower life expectancy than the U.K.
t1_dts6gtf	0	*	Yes? How is that a valid response? He was talking about *levels* of inequality
t1_dts82q4	0	*	That is after his shithole comments too - keep that in mind.
t1_dtt9zb0	0	*	Increases equality, societal freedom and opposes hierarchy while destroying elitist power structures and redistributing wealth => left wing.
t1_dtt91oe	0	*	They weren't really to the right of the Democrats back then.
t1_dttamfx	0	*	How is it over the top and how is it incorrect?
t1_dts2vax	0	*	Which is fantastic. Now, if each state can do their own - why do the liberal states not have free and superior healthcare? 
t1_dtsufci	1	*	Europe is not one country.
t1_du0j5bm	1	*	healthy capitalism per population should have a smooth rising line between poverty and rich providing a middle class. unhealthy capitalism has a bare rise up to about 1-2% where it skyrockets.
t1_dsvsqhm	1	*	Not everything is about economics, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs after all. The main reasons for Brexit are NOT economic ones.
t1_dsgfh2m	1	*	And you're even more likely to die in a  car crash on your way to wherever you're going. 
t1_dtswe6c	0	*	Israel doesn't seem to have much issue with holocaust denial criminalization which exists throughout much of Europe.
t1_dtt71b3	0	*	Don't take it up with me, take it up with the holocaust survivors the phrase was used by and originated with 
t1_duxgsxh	0	*	It is. 
t1_dsuq9r4	0	*	Thank you. My comment was a real question. $38B is a drop in the bucket, but the sarcastic tone it was delivered in suggests that meh, who cares. We have to start somewhere.
t1_dt7tcst	1	*	that's just not true.
t1_dt7tbs5	1	*	that is such a simplistic and wrong statement, it hurts my brain.  i'm sorry you can't see the difference.
t1_dtzfua8	0	*	The only thing Israel did to create Hamas is probably by not killing itself.  Hamas' goal is the destruction of Israel, you do know that right?
t1_dsmeqcb	1	*	you aren't worth the time.
t1_dsi1axi	0	*	Here take a downvote bud
t1_dsib3hl	0	*	/r/credibledefense perhaps
t1_dsl6n8u	1	*	I am adding you as a reference on my resume, and this incident goes on my resume too. Need something important on that blank sheet!
t1_dsi9pop	1	*	Right, he just flashed the outline of his boner to a bunch of women on a plane. The guy is a perv like Anthony Weiner and the rest of the Democratic party
t1_dsi6qyh	1	*	i like this reference 
t1_dsi5510	1	*	Its ok, we still love you
t1_dsi4bh1	0	*	The absolute irony. Difference too is that Trump makes these kind of slip ups regularly. The fact that this is still brought up for Obama shows how rare it was.
t1_dsi9l3t	1	*	Nah he just accidentally said fifty instead of fourty. It's pretty obvious what he meant if you watch the video.
t1_dsie6jl	1	*	I always wondered why we sold so much stuff. I figured what ever we did sell was borderline obsolete
t1_dsic4q3	1	*	I don't know, and yet here we are
t1_dsi6wm2	0	*	It always goes both ways but he is the one in office right now.
t1_dsioivp	1	*	I didn't comment on whether it's funny, I just said it's lazy because it's too easy. 
t1_dsid60o	1	*	Also incredibly redundant.
t1_dsi44dp	0	*	Yeah. Which is what makes it creepy. I mean, imagine if we updated Wikipedia with everything Trump states as being a fact. lol
t1_dsicdv9	0	*	Bonus insinuates that he does his primary duties beforehand, which he doesn't. This *is* what he does.
t1_dsi9diw	1	*	I hope to one day live in a world where Canada has taken over the US, I'm already sorry I don't
t1_dv4j2rc	1	*	Apprently you do since you're screaming to defend him 
t1_dsi6xgq	0	*	So wait, Canada and Scandinavia are going to take over the world?  Sign me the fuck up.
t1_dsi7q25	0	*	>They aren't pillaging or anything bad, mostly just introducing Africans to the word cunt and talking shit about Britain.  This man knows da way. He is our new commander.
t1_dsibwtf	0	*	maybe fuck you
t1_dsj3dh1	0	*	Dc doesn't count and you count North and South Dakota as 1 but not north and south carolina
t1_dsj614o	1	*	He's spends 1/4 of his life golfing, starts works at 11AM, and watches 8 hours of TV everyday. I don't think it's too much to expect him to remember 1 little fact.
t1_dshpmvt	0	*	Know not, I now believe well. 
t1_dsl6o52	1	*	Now delivered via ICBMs
t1_dsjdbaj	1	*	> Some perspective please  Okay. I already provided that. This one mistake = fine. Perspective = he is constantly making mistakes like this and it's getting embarrassing at this point.
t1_dsikd07	1	*	Typos happen when I use talk to text. 
t1_dsin4ox	1	*	Any component going through cyclic stress above the endurance limit will have fatigue issues given enough time in service.
t1_dsinr4b	0	*	It's a tactic to use when you don't need a defense for the current president, right?
t1_dsibc0k	1	*	Take a chance on me.
t1_dsifonz	0	*	Obama started those wars? That's news to me. How convenient to forget Bush and his Halliburton buddies. 
t1_dsj56p1	1	*	Of course not. Trump is too well liked all around the world. Trust me he is popular. Bigly
t1_dsi8qjp	0	*	He did Men instead 
t1_dsiba57	0	*	Generate outrage wherever and however you can.
t1_dsii1p5	1	*	Three tits? That's awesome.  https://i.imgur.com/IYhZA2F.jpg

t1_du0i9ss	1	*	Reminds me of erdogan.
t1_du00ada	0	*	/r/gatekeeping   We are allowed to criticize and condemn war crimes, regardless of whatever a completely different country is doing.

t1_dsrqdus	0	*	So nato is the reason that Kosovo has a political environment similar to Moscow?
t1_dtzms2l	0	*	because it would still be significantly better than how it is now and what happens at the one place where there is joint industry, at Kaesong
t1_du08w2q	1	*	The most nutritious food in all of the north, re-shat shit. 
t1_dtzj7av	0	*	as long as she can wear some leather clothing
t1_dszrf9o	1	*	Well that was a depressing thing to read first thing in the morning. Cheers!
t1_dszbdqg	1	*	You had to be there...
t1_dszbejq	1	*	Pretty sure anyone could keep up if they had coke though. That's kinda the point of coke, innit? One little sniff and you're sober again
t1_dszxaw8	1	*	Stuff tastes a little like spoiled milk, but will def get you there.
t1_dsz5oxp	1	*	Right next to you, just need some binoculars to see it
t1_dszts35	1	*	Think sarcasm 
t1_dt9177d	1	*	I wonder what those at T_D are saying right now?
t1_dt8vn46	1	*	No dog deserves to be stuck with him.
t1_dt8ty6y	0	*	No, we don't want her soiling up our fields of wheat.
t1_dt8tkur	1	*	I'm assuming he's talking about Charles I, though they didn't exactly drag him out of parliament. 
t1_dt8uk9i	1	*	You mean the one we just built? I kind of doubt it
t1_dt8x5gf	1	*	I agree, I meant that there is a big difference between a college group creating a safe space and the President doing it
t1_dt8tia6	0	*	No, it's memey. 
t1_dt98l6d	0	*	Not assuming. I'm taking his words seriously. He's said all he needs to to align himself with Erdogan. 
t1_dt907vo	0	*	The point is if you want to be a politician, *expect protests*. Part of the job.
t1_dt92h7s	1	*	I don't think so. It would be immensely tasteless.   Look if you are dying of COPD when in hospital... Now's NOT the best time to say maybe you shouldn't have had that pack a day cigarette habit. 
t1_dt8tub8	0	*	Woah, I hope you aren't denigrating man's best friend with a comparison to Trumps?
t1_dt9o46s	1	*	Twinning's or bust i say.
t1_dt9250l	1	*	Trump isn't a fan of legalities. Unless it's laws that benefit him. Or individuals.  Pretty much: If it benefits Trump it's legal & good.  If it doesn't, if it isn't illegal it should be.
t1_dt90a5s	1	*	They implied it was still on the books, which... considering how many monarchy related memes there are, sounded unlikely.
t1_dt8rjb9	0	*	Without a /s it appears to be the exact kind of comment magapede would make. Sucks that we need clarification but they make some stupid comments just like this. If it was a a joke, my apologies.
t1_dt9nayr	1	*	It *did* work out quite well for Japan, historically speaking.
t1_dt8vkos	1	*	Why, I do declare you've given me the vapors!
t1_dt8yaov	1	*	And if they do source it would it be indefensible or would the goal posts just move?
t1_dt8yilz	1	*	Sounds like a great trade!!
t1_dt9uouw	1	*	Technically the queen is some random person.
t1_dt8tj8b	1	*	It's the Xian Fundamentalist Israel he loves. 
t1_dt92tac	0	*	His point is entirely on point.
t1_dt96xh0	1	*	He has Mike Pence so close enough.
t1_dt8wjrq	1	*	I didn't dispute that, just calling out the rationale of not wanting to be met with protests.
t1_dt8wgj9	1	*	Get out and vote against Trump via republican Congress members
t1_dt8vim9	0	*	I think that mostly comes down to the lack of guns, rather than the Big Brother-level surveillance.
t1_dt8szph	1	*	I doubt Trump is raw.  Hes seen so many sunbeds itd be like chewing an old shoe.
t1_dt8vnyf	1	*	Bring on the nukes.  Right on my face Long Jong Un
t1_dt8zi93	1	*	Unfortunately the ones that go on about it are the ones that elected him
t1_dt91p7w	1	*	Careful, don't go to /r/politics and say anything about nuking North Korea. I got banned for making a joke about feeding Christians to lions, no telling what they'll do to you.
t1_dt952zo	1	*	Must not have had their covfefevefeedfeee yet
t1_dt9oo5b	1	*	Obligatory link to Newcastle Utd Football fan punching a police horse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTsxZPJDcUY   It didn't end well for him, but not as a result of the horse.

t1_dt8ufjw	0	*	Michael?!

t1_dt92b3w	1	*	You Mr. Pot farmer... You sir, are an enigma.

t1_dt942l0	1	*	I think we (English) were the first to behead a monarch. Happy to be corrected though.
t1_dt8wqus	1	*	Not if we still want to remain friends with our UK cousins.
t1_dt93gcv	1	*	We nuked Japan, and they started pumping out Toyotas, Nintendos,  and animated tentacle porn.  A nuking might be exactly what America needs.  
t1_dt8tc4x	1	*	To be entirely accurate, most of us didn't.
t1_dt8u02a	0	*	3/10 is the best I can do

t1_dt8u9rq	0	*	Some of us yeah. 
t1_dt8vrny	0	*	ignore
t1_dt8z6md	0	*	And so you shouldn't be. These are representative democracies, not direct ones.  Congress, however? Yeah they really should be smart enough, but the two party system fucked that up.
t1_dt8wdfj	0	*	This is like 90% true... You cant count on all dogs... my friend had a rescue dog that hated any man in a baseball hat. 
t1_dt8x5he	1	*	I don't think you're quite catching his drift here.
t1_dt8zewk	0	*	Dude, I'm Canadian, living in Vancouver, where we have the good weed, and me and like 50 people are already on board with beheading the fuck in public if he decides to visit ever.
t1_dt8y81x	0	*	You don't have a constitutional right to access the Internet.  Removing Net Neutrality isn't giving the government more power to regulate and censor the Internet.  
t1_dt8zb1m	1	*	Nobody has a fucking right to not be insulted
t1_dt9g4lx	1	*	Dementia?
t1_dt8wfhq	1	*	Google it
t1_dt8uhu6	0	*	Of course. Because those are *our* women.
t1_dt9cl0h	0	*	I mean he did dump the whole box of food into the tank. That really happened. It was the editorializing that was wrong, which I addressed.
t1_dt9cuyl	0	*	The Queen: OI YOU TANGERINE GIT YE CAN FECK RIGHT OFF.

t1_dt97nzz	1	*	My arse is quite cheery looking to be fair.
t1_dt92j1g	1	*	Not sure if you saw this website but it seems to cover it all pretty well. http://www.presidentialpetmuseum.com/
t1_dt8yjnu	0	*	That's sounds like a very interesting day! How'd you get involved with that?
t1_dt9oogo	1	*	They knew what they were signing up for
t1_dt8veeu	0	*	Honestly, I think he has a very small mind view of the world. He saw some film about england in 17th centruy and decides that's what it's still like ..cause genuis.
t1_dt8u69p	1	*	He's, like, a very not fascist stable genius
t1_dt8usco	1	*	My argument is that the meaning is on a slippery slope to being all encompassing of anything that anyone finds offensive, which is not good for a healthy society. 
t1_dt9nd17	0	*	Don't do that to yourself.
t1_dt8uspc	1	*	LOL o Man I feel, I feel you.... :'(

t1_dt92eii	1	*	Count Dankula.
t1_dt8ubhl	1	*	Dank trump trumps 
t1_dt9zbl3	0	*	I don't. I'd give them all the Romanov Treatment. But I'm in a minority (at least nationwide, wouldn't be so sure about Merseyside).
t1_dt91p37	1	*	Even if thats the case its still the american system and america elects whoever the electoral college elects so ipso facto america elected him
t1_dt8uqe1	0	*	Oh definitely, was going through the channels before work the other morning and seen him on there. Way too early in the morning to be listening to a grown man try and start arguments live on TV.
t1_dtapf90	1	*	I think at this point, the entire world is poised to pay for it. Or at least the interest, the American people get to cover the principle. 
t1_dt99bl6	1	*	Nobody wants Trump.    North Korea must LOVE seeing Trump in power. It makes them LOOK GOOD in comparison! 
t1_dt8xagw	1	*	Now kiss. 
t1_dt9axjz	1	*	Already talked about this to another user. Look it up above or below or whatever 
t1_dtahwb2	1	*	Because enough people in the US have become divorced from reality. 
t1_dta4gwf	1	*	Again. The transcript shows he never mentions protests, nor does he mention banning them.  Please read it.   Newsweek isn't the most reliable source as we have seen recently. 
t1_dt924n0	1	*	THERE'S BEEN A MURDER
t1_dt8tupl	1	*	The south shall rise again!
t1_dt8vj7r	1	*	Well yeah, he was murdered. Not assassinated. It was a botched robbery gone fatal, that's it. That neighborhood was known for stick ups.
t1_dt8vlp5	1	*	It's a great trade if the UK gets rid of May and keeps Trump, but puts him in prison!! I'd call it s Win-Win!!
t1_dt8u2wr	0	*	I'd go so far as to say that Reagan Republicans were the start of the Trump base. People begging to be lied to, reality be damned.

t1_dt8ve05	0	*	You sure you came to the right Barry? I'd sooner be in Chepstow.
t1_dt8z1r2	1	*	All wounds heal with time brother.

t1_dtwuv3l	1	*	You tell me, Doctor. 
t1_dtwujup	1	*	Good point. The bigger point is that all media is controlled by a specific social class that shouldn't exist, and their only goal is self-preservation.

t1_ducs4tl	0	*	Then why is he refusing to enforce the near unanimously passed ones?  It's not his job to choose what gets to be law or not after he's signed it.  It's his job to enforce them.

t1_dsra4t4	1	*	Not banned, but are definitely stifling development with tax breaks. By putting on severe penalties to Chinese manufacturers of solar panels, its crippling the ability to move forward with installs. 
t1_dtodk53	1	*	You're also correct, I think people are misunderstanding you.
t1_dtog5k4	1	*	Precisely. Sirens would go off for a watch not just warnings. Many false alarms. Where Im from, the reaction to the siren became all of us running outside to look at the sky.

t1_dtsjieh	0	*	I didn't say they do the same amount of killing I said there is no difference in their ideology. Both are terrorist organization that want to see the fall of western civilization.

t1_dtsjvyq	0	*	Thanks, but I didn't, you get one of those little red envelopes whenever someone mentions your username in a post. 
t1_dti8b4n	1	*	Me too. I wasn't referring to anything specific being wrong with it, just that I like to take any single source with a grain of salt (Who watches the Watchmen, etc)

t1_dsk8poy	1	*	Thanks for the clarification on the quotas, now I remember how it works.
t1_dskgx6c	0	*	Actually, they invested their oil money wisely because they didn't want to be dependent on it. Norway has the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, over 1 trillion dollars in assets.
t1_dsjydwi	1	*	Any centrist politician in Norway would be called a Far-Left communist sympathizer by The Republican Party.

t1_dsjwj8c	1	*	I think it's really weird to imply that your race/heritage/ethcetera bond you to a regions culture. 
t1_dskes4i	1	*	Do you think he's aware of Norway's economic system?
t1_dsjvnbw	1	*	That sounded deep
t1_dsjxhd6	1	*	It's one thing to say times change, another to decide to undo your country's entire political philosophy.
t1_dska6sq	0	*	 >Pretty sure Haitian could easily be categorized as a race.   You clearly don't know what definition of race, nor racism. I suggest taking to google before you continue to embarrass yourself.

t1_dsjvujj	0	*	NY Post is only good if you like funny headlines. New York Times and Wash Post are quality.
t1_dsk04k0	0	*	Trump was talking about the immigrants, though. He implied that because they come from a developing nation, they can't possibly be as valuable to the country as someone from a developed nation.
t1_dskixu8	1	*	>Freedom-hating  Freedom doesn't mean that you have to accept everyone who wants to come here.  There's a reason that countries have borders, to protect their native citizens.

t1_dty9ztf	1	*	Just keep it on Summer hours all the time. That way all the plant people get their extra evening light, and you... you just don't get sunlight at 8pm in the winter. Sorry.

t1_dty0br3	0	*	Where I am in NY, its still light out just shy of 9:00pm in the summer. Then during the winter its dark before 5:00pm.  It does a number on me every year.
t1_dtz49g8	1	*	Here in the Netherlands the sun rises at 5:30 am during summer. Taking out the daylight saving time would mean it would rise at 4:30 am, which would be annoying if you dont have the right curtains.

t1_dty2s5l	0	*	You realize that you don't actually get any more sunlight with DST, right? 
t1_dty8lof	1	*	I'd be OK with switching to DST year round... but I still think people haven't fully thought through the prospect of the sun not rising until 9:30 or 10:00am. 
t1_dtyrmk3	1	*	Its not impossible. The entire air travel industry does it. Get those programmers to put a sticky note with their local offset or something.
t1_dtxyit2	0	*	Yes, and they worked, but also aggravated my anxiety. You win some, you lose some

t1_duedsra	1	*	Dude, half the menus in that town had Russian translations but no English.
t1_duedzw5	0	*	It would be fucking hilarious if that happened. Trump gets pardoned and then immediately returned to his previous post as president. It all could happen in less than a minute and nothing would change.

t1_duegyi8	1	*	Would you care to elaborate?
t1_due8gk3	1	*	He did it because the Sheriff, Joe Arpio, was loyal. This guy's demands for loyalty are that of a third world dictator. No wonder his adult children are so brainwashed and submissive to him.
t1_duedh8r	1	*	No, they're not. You can still get arrested by the authorities of the country you're transiting through, even if stay airside and never go through passport control.

t1_dti5ipm	1	*	Seems like a good way to get more treason 
t1_dtidek7	0	*	Plus he was born in Leningrad/Saint Petersburg - it's nearly impossible to *get* any further west and still be in Russia.
t1_dti9g5r	0	*	He dropped some acid, I hope.
t1_dtip2u9	1	*	Slovenians do not need to. We got First Lady in the White House. 
t1_dtid6vl	1	*	Czechoslovakia didn't need to. They used an electric fence instead.
t1_dti9g1v	0	*	Honestly, there is something hilarious about the fact that Trump's defense is he can't impartially investigate me because I have already stollen from him personally and he knows about it. 
t1_dtisc7b	0	*	u/skordge is entirely correct.
t1_dti6mzo	0	*	Btw, if you honestly believe this Russian collusion thing, then you'd take a long hard look at why the Obama admin was selling nuclear material to the boogeyman Russia. But you won't.
t1_dwh8yje	0	*	It is, but they've been under sanctions for so long I don't think it'll hurt their ability to project millitary power.   Economic on the other hand, you do have a point. 
t1_dtic6en	0	*	The left says Trump brainwashed his supporters, the right says government/media has brainwashed liberals.
t1_dursxcg	0	*	Not sure where the hate coming from. It is just ex military professionals earning money the way they can.

t1_dusm7wp	0	*	And the church. Remember, you are **NOT** clear to fire on the church!
t1_dtkuo8t	1	*	It's exactly what it is. Every single time an individual or country takes a stance that Israel does not like, it cries antisemitism. 
t1_dtktjqm	1	*	> I mean it wasn't industrial levels of persecution and genocide so sure.  No, it was centuries of people living in peace with *some* but not that many cases of persecution. 
t1_dtlcatt	0	*	Then why make up stories about opening up dams to flood Gaza, or Israeli doctors practicing eugenics on immigrants, or poisoning Palestinian water supplies?
t1_dtkqlsh	0	*	These are essentially hate crimes. The UK police doesn't care about hate crimes?
t1_dtl8mzd	0	*	holding an opinion does not necessarily  mean someone would act on that opinion and commit a hate crime
t1_dtl1umy	0	*	Which terror attacks specifically are you talking about, could you like an article mentioning that?   Asian in the UK means South Asian, i.e. Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi.

t1_dtkz4o2	1	*	Thanks. Though some of the statistics are slightly dated, they do support your argument. 
t1_dtmbgf8	1	*	Yeah because the left is largly opposed to that sort of thing.
t1_dtlv686	1	*	I'm not the one who said, and I quote, they pose no threat to anybody.  It would be a ridiculous thing to say about any group.
t1_dtmcmva	1	*	You must not be very good at citing sources. I'd be very interested in seeing the evidence for your wildly fictitious claim.

t1_dtlzju4	1	*	im really upset about this.
t1_dtlz92z	0	*	Not true. It was way before Kellog that it was mostly sanitary. Kellogg brought the custom back for reasons.  Not sure but I think he also spreaded the masturbation causes blindness myth

t1_dtvtsm5	0	*	Wrong poster, I think
t1_dtwf9kj	0	*	How is he wrong? 
t1_dtw7c99	1	*	Not always. People can be sneaky and manipulative. Use emotions to make a crowd do terrible things like rape, murder etc. That's how race and religious riots happen.

t1_duddb0j	0	*	You don't think that helped Trump?
t1_ducqope	1	*	That's right. Only Trump is credible. Even though he gets caught in lies over. and. over. and. over. again.
t1_dud6a08	0	*	Wtf kind of strawman is that
t1_dud3bu7	1	*	Rock on.
t1_dudjj36	1	*	> If you don't agree with my comically biased opinion on this one issue, you must be stupid because people who disagree with me are stupid because mommy said I'm special.  Fixed it for you. 
t1_dudejse	0	*	Im not joking 
t1_ducsd5l	0	*	Exactly. So why are people in this thread acting like this proves something that we didnt already know?  We meddle in their elections and they meddle in ours. Not exactly breaking news.
t1_dudgu9u	0	*	They really did not care whether they helped Trump or not. Putin does not like Hillary Clinton and made it a mission to squash her!!

t1_dudfze2	0	*	What about people, like in the DNC stepping down right before, say a memo is released?   
t1_duedsuw	0	*	It could have cost him the presidency during the election, but something more substantial is needed to end a presidency once it starts. I don't think Trump is a special case. 
t1_dud8vy3	1	*	Tell that to the kids in Florida
t1_dud5ys2	1	*	they are part of *a larger case*... If you look at the whole picture, Americans become involved and hacking's influence on the outcome comes into question. 
t1_dukz5zv	0	*	The reason u/nanonan hasnt responded is because he cant back up his claims, but lets page him just in case.
t1_dud1w8m	1	*	People quoting him and him posting it are 2 different things.  You realize this right?
t1_dud22a7	1	*	They were going to have Flynn sign a deal then all of a sudden they stopped it. Flynn has not signed a deal yet. 
t1_dueaxyu	1	*	True. We've seen a glimpse of it by how Bush has given the U.S. a really bad name internationally... Making people associate Dubya with everything else American.
t1_duenynm	0	*	It literally says on your profile that you're active in that community. 
t1_duddcuh	0	*	How so? It's the liberals who seem to believe that voters shouldn't have a voice because they literally little children that got swayed by big bad russia.
t1_dud96u2	0	*	Its almost like she was running merely to siphon votes from the left in order to increase the odds of a certain (shitty) candidate winning ...

t1_dud6tcx	0	*	Do you also think if Hillary was elected she wouldn't enforce Russian sanctions? You think every time she was asked about Russia she would fellate Putin and put him before Americans?
t1_due1r1o	1	*	ok?
t1_dud03my	1	*	Ah, thanks. 
t1_ducvyaw	1	*	Its not, but if you want to classify it as such go right ahead. Your definition of spam is pretty sensitive. I personally appreciate the updates to this list.

t1_ds71h6l	1	*	Are you sure?
t1_ds5gb4f	0	*	Also permanent member of the national security council. But outside of that, just a coffee boy. 
t1_ds5beeo	1	*	Fair enough. I retract my barbed comment.

t1_ds4qyot	0	*	Hmmmm.   Well, Trump and Bannon and others have said they leak fake info to the mainstream news to embarrass them, so maybe?  But talking shit like this is Bannon playing with fire.
t1_ds5cn5f	0	*	Fox is on every screen in every military base I've been too, sadly they're not going anywhere. 
t1_ds5acgr	1	*	trump probably thinks whom'st'dve is a real word

t1_ds4tk25	0	*	I've heard him speak on a number of subjects within the last few months- these comments don't match his recent statements.
t1_ds54a8l	1	*	Whataboutism.
t1_ds6krlm	0	*	Interesting you're so devoted to calling out others for 'shit grammar' when you yourself don't bother with capitalisation or proper punctuation.  
t1_ds5t3mr	1	*	Ah, gotcha. I generally read the NYT which I find covers the details quite well - the issue for the reader at this point is just staying on top of everything.
t1_ds5fvdt	1	*	Roll Tide!
t1_ds5ihem	1	*	If there's a pool, I get 4 years old!
t1_ds5l57h	1	*	The fucking emails that he was forced to release. Where have you been? The emails emphasized this fact quite a bit. 
t1_ds5nyuc	1	*	Where did the Pakistan thing come from the day before? Was it a Fox and Friends segment as well?
t1_ds5c7ch	1	*	Yep! And my grandpa stole some bubble gum back in his youth so that absolves anyone of any wrongdoing for the last 80 years!
t1_ds5kj7g	1	*	How do you know that theyre not writing a book? Itd be premature to write a book before the storys over. 
t1_ds5p2z9	1	*	No, as in The Wire is literally based on a book that is a journalist writing fiction.
t1_ds58s9s	1	*	We just need to convince 3 or 4 of those republican pundits to fall on their words like they're live grenades. It can be done. Maybe.
t1_ds5fj44	0	*	The problem is that with most presidents, you cant tell that its written by someone else.

t1_ds5adh6	1	*	I used to love reading /r/conspiracy.  What a sad thing it has become.  On the other hand though, making fun of it did give us /r/topmindsofreddit, so there is that.
t1_ds5h0jg	0	*	Typical Trump supporter.   Can't support his cult leader without pointing the finger at Hillary or Obama.   Pure whataboutism.

t1_dtwdnl7	1	*	Fyrom is not really located where the ancient Macedonian region was. That region was called Paeonia and it bordered Macedonia.
t1_dtwliku	1	*	This one pisses me off the most.  Constantinople is probably the coolest name for a city ever.

t1_dt9b064	0	*	Quebec is to Canada as a brain tumor to a brain. Or a pimple on a nose.
t1_dt99n58	1	*	Hypocrisy is universal. The system must be designed to take this into account. Sort of like separation of power to protect against absolute power.
t1_dt96f3t	1	*	As someone who grew up in the US and moved to Canada, and just moved back to the US...I already want to move back to Canada.  I don't like my home country anymore.  
t1_dt9hyss	1	*	no, he actually said that!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGbZ84PqHgI
t1_dt8xgos	1	*	Ugh. I wish people would stop calling it socialized healthcare. It's Single Payer healthcare, and with 325,000,000+ people, man, the US could dictate some pretty sweet terms...
t1_dutzu5v	0	*	The difference here is people have talk touched and seen possessed people and its on film, Bigfoot is a blurry spot in forest pictures.
t1_dv2bz3d	0	*	Well if we're going to play that game, we should also count the Holocaust.
t1_dv372b8	1	*	They're both in Europe, which is the comparison that is0ph was trying to make.
t1_dupigpr	0	*	How is he a liberal?
t1_dt0o3lw	0	*	Helis does not require runaway and can use different fly path. Yes, it get reduced, but it still more than possible
t1_du44rlo	1	*	The arbitrariness is just in whoever edited Wikipedia, though. The actual survey has 140 cities.
t1_du4dk4q	1	*	Because it's obviously a great place to live?
t1_durx45y	0	*	It's Linux and an Open Source project. You can probably just sync some boxes over the internet and there are probably some guides online on how to do it.
t1_dv00lt6	1	*	It's not too hard to use the right program. But why bother with the cloud if you already have a standard version for work?  It will definitely help people get into it, and that's a good thing.
t1_du0slj3	1	*	What they're doing is disgusting. I never disagreed with that.
t1_du11y1e	1	*	Its a beautiful country with compassion Im sure. 
t1_ds4w0mc	0	*	>Where did I say that?  >Because it's your decision to have sex so you should be responsible enough to pay for your own mistakes
t1_duj5d64	1	*	does it actually improve performance, or is it more oh everyone is using it, better ban it scenario
t1_duhu93s	0	*	HuffPo probably got the idea from NBC, which aired a segment on the Olympic stones all coming from one island.
t1_duiwf73	1	*	But if you make a good decision on where to place the stone, AND can place it with more accuracy, that would be a difference maker.
t1_dun9sbx	1	*	Oh, You like that? Huh I...I.. I bet that really blows your mind, Want me to erase it?   
t1_dt5uoyv	1	*	It isn't meant as an objective view, it's meant as the Turkish view and reasoning behind the operation.
t1_dt378r7	1	*	Lol. You sound like my 4 year old niece. Have a gnite
t1_dslhz3p	0	*	To mutilate something means you are destroying something. Signing initials on an organ he transplanted is in bad taste, but it's not mutilating the organ. It works perfectly fine before and after. 
t1_dslss97	0	*	That may have another spot where he took another dump. 
t1_dsvxt2z	1	*	Yea, great movie but could never be made today.

t1_dv3i220	0	*	Excluding the gingers though, right?
t1_dv4ybsa	1	*	You should campaign to get 4chan shut down 
t1_dv367vg	1	*	Damn, really? It doesn't seem like it was that long ago. And hey I'm not justifying it, just trying to offer up reasons for it still being up other than blatant incompetency.
t1_dv4aj70	0	*	Hillary's campaign helped Trump too with their media connections, should we arrest her?
t1_dv38l5z	1	*	The smartest criminals are the ones who understand they're going up against people much smarter than they are.  The dumbest criminals are otherwise smart people who overestimate their own abilities.
t1_dv3snrw	0	*	Can You say overly sensitive cunt? I bet you cant. I bet you get triggered by the phrase overly sensitive cunt. You poor thing you. 
t1_dv36pcz	0	*	I remember the good old days when Mitt Romney was savagely mocked for pointing out that Russia was our biggest global threat.

t1_dv3m947	0	*	/r/wayofthebern was so obvious
t1_dv3djz4	1	*	3 syllables is a punchline. It's you or tennessee.
t1_dv3f523	1	*	TD is a strong source of user engagement. Online tech companies really like user engagement.
t1_dv3a079	1	*	You see all these people here responding? They got here by sorting by controversial. Downvoted comments can still be part of a discussion on this sub, but not on t-d. 
t1_dv36ob4	0	*	That's one of those situations where, as a mod, you're pretty much fucked either way. At that time reddit hadn't collectively thrown up in its mouth like now.
t1_dv3kn7q	0	*	Could this mean most of the talk about troll bots is then just bunk to dismiss other views?
t1_dv3bo0t	0	*	I dont think I can personally stop you from being downvoted, but for what its worth, I upvoted you.
t1_dv35yxc	1	*	I agree with everyone else, lets see that rebuttal.
t1_dv35yxb	1	*	Can you maybe post some examples if this so called calls for murder
t1_dv3ko6k	1	*	Why would that be something to be ashamed of?
t1_dv39o6r	1	*	They'd rather have an echo chamber than a discussion.   Subs that do this are the embodiment of the all or nothing us vs them mentality that's poisoning the current political and social discourse.
t1_dv3hm4c	0	*	It seems like we have alot of fascists lately, some of them like to call themselves liberals and some like to call themselves conservatives. Pretty interesting to watch.
t1_dv35upd	1	*	Really? Let's see some links, then.
t1_dv38pci	1	*	Source that a gag order can compel speech?
t1_dv3gzks	0	*	You do realize there are more than just the presidential candidates on the ballot? 
t1_dv3hj4s	0	*	I joined well after that and had many default subs that I was automatically subscribed to.  2x, news, world news, get motivated, politics, I didn't subscribe to any of these.
t1_dvexbn4	1	*	Evil? Really.  We clearly define that word very differently.
t1_dv3csjo	1	*	I don't think deleting anything that's brought to their attention is good policy. It's what ad customers want, keeping out of controversy
t1_dv3f3qv	1	*	> What happens when Germans say squirrel?  Skwerrel happens.
t1_dv364zv	0	*	Is that really the place for a wish list though? 
t1_dv45mly	1	*	It's a Europe thing really. It's existence in America is mostly made up. 
t1_dv3nhbw	1	*	Not what I was saying.      I was speaking regarding the whole collusion fiasco.
t1_dv3e1p3	1	*	From my understanding, they were somewhat more sophisticated in that they dedicated each account to a specific persona. 
t1_dv3aj5i	1	*	Look, when you support trump, you are supporting one the most hated human beings on this planet. You shouldn't be surprised ~~is~~if you get downvoted off the page.
t1_dv3cg9i	0	*	How many?
t1_dv3ksmq	1	*	*superscript
t1_dv39dlw	0	*	Kos is decidedly centrist and liberal. A real left-wing publication would be something like Jacobin. 
t1_dv45ai3	1	*	You could try by not posting its unintended use on a popular comment chain. 
t1_dv39oer	1	*	Reddit is only 60% European... 
t1_dv4fpuk	1	*	Whoops, you're absolutely right; thanks!
t1_dv39wtp	1	*	You're just like the president, publicizing fiction over fact then getting offended when someone calls you out on your bullshit. 
t1_dv3az6w	1	*	well it should or the top 3 states control 1/3 of the vote the next 12 control another 1/3 and the last 35 states get the last 1/3.   
t1_dv3fn0c	1	*	Touchxe9

t1_dv37a3d	0	*	We were talking about Russian bots, not journalists.
t1_dv38hvp	1	*	one way would be to add a report user button to profiles.

t1_dv3g4vb	1	*	..because people that follow Donald 'grab em by the pussy' Trump aren't idiots, right?..
t1_dv3r0ya	0	*	Yeah. They posted it March 31 2017. Today is March 2 2018. So they posted it last March.
t1_dv3ohck	1	*	Exactly. It's not like reddit uses Captcha for individual comments.
t1_dv39mw2	0	*	It could be that they wanted to quarantine these people to the sub?  Deleting the main area they congregate would just force them to spread.  I don't know if that's the case, but it's a perspective. 
t1_dv3hztg	1	*	Doxing and harassment has nothing to do with hating their opinions.  There's a point when you go from someone having an opinion to someone who's just being an asshole.
t1_dv35kxh	1	*	It very well good be. It's just a rumor I heard a while back that does make a little bit of sense. 
t1_dv3eg0d	0	*	Lmao republicans got you that upset? I see more left wingers wigging out at conservatives than vice versa
t1_dv3cprt	0	*	Well, from my understanding you generally aren't allowed to prove if you are the subject of/participating in a federal investigation. I'm fairly certain people have gone to jail for that in the past.
t1_dv4h6hk	1	*	I worked in tech for 30 years as a consultant in numerous organizations. If I met 2 Republicans in the industry Id be surprised.

t1_dv372on	1	*	I got banned for saying McDonald's would apologize for their tweet as soon as Trump apologized to Obama for the things he said.   Worth it. 
t1_dv3vak1	1	*	That's like a $5 bit. It's not even funny. 
t1_dv3fta2	0	*	That's actually fucking retarded  EDIT: CP is an instant permaban on 4chan. You'd have to be dumb to think 4chan would able to legally stay up as a site if it allowed CP.
t1_dv4aqbr	0	*	A Trump supportee...from Sweden? What the hell? Why would a Swedish kid give a damn about American politics? 
t1_dv39v95	1	*	Oddly enough r/unpopularopinion is pretty rational within the discussions though topics lean to the right

t1_dv3bq6o	1	*	There already is a bot that detects other bots on Reddit though it only runs when summoned

t1_dv33wh9	1	*	I think you've got a tough year ahead of you, friend.
t1_dv37nxk	1	*	I mean, it's part of how they operate. Yeah, Facebook and Twitter promote sharing too, but they've always been more willing to shut down content as part of their operation. Reddit hasn't.
t1_dv3as0o	1	*	What he's saying is that it's possible that Reddit is collaborating with investigative agencies and leaving those posts up as honeypots.
t1_dv3m48x	0	*	Youre a regular in /r/politics. Your opinion has just as much worth as you say his does. None.
t1_dv35fja	0	*	You should probably get your memory checked out if you're having troubling recalling events from only 15 months ago.

t1_dv3f0ex	1	*	Really makes you think about how much of an insufferable Puritan lolcow the left became
t1_dv365m2	1	*	Eh, at this point they are there own little bubble filled with bots. I'd wager most people on reddit what that sub is and what they stand for. Their out reach would rarely go past reddit.

t1_duzl62a	1	*	it would be ideal if things always go that way
t1_dt08w1q	0	*	Google sachsen (or niedersachsen) nazis and see what's coming up. 
t1_dtu4hya	1	*	This works both ways
t1_dtui9dj	1	*	Actually, you are right. It just doesn't give a fuck.
t1_dtuficq	0	*	All execution is wrong, though.
t1_dtulvvc	0	*	He is saying that it is either the people doing the testing at fault, or the people doing the manipulation, or both. The algorithm itself is neutral.
t1_dtvnwy5	0	*	You: Facts are the worst! They upset me.
t1_dtvnann	1	*	So no, you cant read. 
t1_dv4z6n1	1	*	exactly, arrests require charges. Indefinite detentions have no accountability. 
t1_dujjirf	0	*	What is INSA?
t1_dtj4j1y	1	*	Do you not think there are valid reasons for certain information to be confidential? 
t1_dv2k1qv	0	*	A girl in theory ;D
t1_dv4rje8	1	*	The layman's definition of theory is almost identical to mathematical theory.
t1_dv2fp01	1	*	The point is that there is a lot of them, so random chance won't screw them all up.
t1_dtdjl45	0	*	WTF is your point? Vetting is hard. This is what I said. Nobody is particularly good at it. Your god Mueller let a hillary shill be his second  in command.
t1_duc88s0	0	*	This guy crimes.
t1_duc8q9b	1	*	Thanks NRA!
t1_duc9yyd	0	*	You're a hero u/sLAUGHTER
t1_ducapzh	1	*	Fair. 
t1_duck8pe	1	*	Then they shouldn't have committed crimes against society if they wanted to use the benefits of society.
t1_dt9cb1c	0	*	What the hell made you presume I felt otherwise? Also, if I didnt believe in human-caused climate change, you could perhaps use softer methods of persuasion. 
t1_dsem0wg	0	*	What part of the link is going to change the consequence of this action? 
t1_dszztqi	1	*	No, its 8 hours from your last drink. You also cant be feeling the effects of the alcohol i.e. a hangover 
t1_dtaqs57	1	*	Yeah we should definitely do that too. Holding politicians accountable and getting rid of daylight savings are not mutually exclusive.
t1_dtafbac	1	*	Get up earlier
t1_dtqriah	1	*	i  agree with you, I just don't want to see nuclear arms normalized, or even be around 
t1_dskbd8o	1	*	To be honest, it was pretty much illegal at the beginning. 
t1_dsm4bkj	0	*	I'd say the DNC is actually more guilty. They had the election in the bag until they turned it into a completely corrupt scandalous shitshow and gave people a reason not to vote.
t1_dsk5cuh	1	*	Go for it? lol
t1_dsk58o5	0	*	I am still waiting for you to share your thought that are critical of this administration.
t1_dslca73	1	*	I'm pointing out that your comment's argument is literally and you are lynching Negroes.
t1_dsk9cnv	0	*	Oh no, random Redditor that has never lived in Canada or North America thinks Canada is better! Maybe us Americans need to go back to the drawing board, LOL.
t1_dsf13eh	0	*	You do realize that is an opinion piece, right?
t1_dsfe182	0	*	hehe, ok :) maybe I make too many of them too, also possible.
t1_dsf3v89	1	*	false. but just cuz you said the word nothing
t1_dsf8u37	1	*	>i just don't think it's my job to have to smell the shit i pulled out of my ass for you. you should want to smell it yourself fully by yourself.
t1_dsf3vgc	1	*	Depends on the context but yeah, it actually could be.
t1_dsf0l5m	0	*	How about we just agree sarcasm has no place in the news subs? Saying the opposite of what you mean isn't clever and doesn't add anything to the discussion. 
t1_dsf6lnp	1	*	Google are far more relevant to international affairs unless Trump has actually done something (tweeting even more garbage doesn't count).
t1_dtxvs80	1	*	Pretty sure this is from Firefly/Serenity.
t1_dv3b34v	0	*	isis born in iraqi schools. Terrorist teaching how to be bomb... 
t1_dt22l7k	1	*	use google translate, works well enough
t1_dspojfx	0	*	Why would I do that when the same courtesy isn't extended to communism?
t1_dspzcj8	0	*	Not to mention I find the idea that humans are enslaved to evolutionary programming an incredibly asinine argument. 
t1_dsx6tdg	0	*	Tartar. You mean Tartar.
t1_dsxtbmq	0	*	oh my, you really believe that dont you? seriously? I would start arguing but you are just trolling. Fighting fire with fire eh, the best way to combat trolls is to troll yourself.
t1_dsy7q96	0	*	http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/11/100000-flee-crimea-as-russia-tightens-grip/ https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/18/ukraine-fear-repression-crimea
t1_dsya9rb	1	*	So the US occupying Iraq is like Russia occupying Crimea? I agree wholeheartedly. 
t1_dsxh1fz	0	*	What do you call the little green men then?
t1_dtrauvn	0	*	Very few and theyre pretty much all in downtown salt lake. 
t1_dtrhafa	1	*	You can't have a deflationary currency because it's always better to hold onto it instead of spending so it's not a currency because you don't want to spend it.
t1_dtrilra	1	*	Everything in moderation. 
t1_dtrfcv9	1	*	Sadly, they applied that algorithm to instagram as well.
t1_dtrdki5	1	*	I believe they have clubs that you have to have membership to, not your average bar. 
t1_dtrnx6u	1	*	Better safe than sorry
t1_dtrc3qz	0	*	Been to Sonora many times... sad that it was actually a destination at one point.
t1_dtroqgu	1	*	added a childhood friend years ago after finding him again. First message he sends  can you like my car pic? got into an argument, blocked him then last year i deleted my account. Its total garbage.
t1_dtsrazk	1	*	You can delete stuff from your search history, which reduces stupid recommendations. Not sure if there is anything to do after you buy it though...
t1_dtredz7	0	*	I'm not 100% sure it's what you're talking about but could you mean Pocket God? I think that was on Facebook at some point
t1_dtrgai0	1	*	Getting all of your news from reddit is going to give you a biased view. Redditors overall very much lean to the left.   Not saying being left is a bad thing, of course.
t1_dts0rvq	1	*	Nailed it.  America.
t1_dtrd7nd	1	*	IG is still good if you only use it for gokd pictures. Don't get too into it, just kind of browse and post the you feel like it. Don't get attached. 
t1_dtrett4	1	*	[Indeed](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9V9iIY3uRvc)
t1_dtrjl3s	0	*	I really, REALLY hope to God thats not true...
t1_dtrf5b6	0	*	Even more so because you can specifically unfollow people you want to keep as friends but exclude from your timeline. 
t1_dtrmlol	1	*	I think you can go into your book buying history and delete the purchase. You can definitely do this for kindle book purchases, I've done it a few times to get rid of some stinkers.
t1_dtrplqx	1	*	Damn, your only real job seems to be being an asshole 24/7, you sure do know how to make friends here.
t1_dtrifu0	1	*	Some of us are Muslim. 
t1_dtri7cz	1	*	You can't see the cover photo of a person who's blocked you.
t1_dtra0th	1	*	Twitter probs. 
t1_dtrnu8o	1	*	Unless you go against the status quo on reddit. Then you get insulted, downvoted, and harassed. Or you're forced into an unhealthy echo chamber. 
t1_dtrbyqg	1	*	Because then you can look at all the cool DVDs and shirts and stuff.
t1_dtripmd	0	*	Thank you :)
t1_dtra13d	1	*	Twitter
t1_dtr8tvk	0	*	They made that share button big enough for them to smash every time a half inspired quote about grandchildren is slapped on a dodgy background of trees.
t1_dtrq988	1	*	You used to be able to swap between new posts and 'suggested' posts. Now it's just the latter, and it's fucking shitty.
t1_dtrq7ui	1	*	Absolutely excuse you.
t1_dts9cdg	1	*	I never thought my mind would change like it did. So much more positive
t1_dtrs024	1	*	5 tabs?   U r lyk a baby. Try *35*  S U C C 
t1_dtrotdg	1	*	> once when they are born and again [...]  I was expecting something else here.  
t1_dtrqjlf	0	*	Couldnt you have ads even if it was chronological 
t1_dtri42z	1	*	Yep 3 posts from scumbags then an ad.
t1_dts9tr1	1	*	'we need your phone number to protect your account!'  I've been Xing that for years.  What pisses me off is they probably already know it anyway. lol
t1_dtrfqos	0	*	Yes removing the chronological news feed ruined it and making businesses and pages pay to have their posts seen. Instagram is much the same now too. 
t1_dtrhk1i	1	*	Thats when I stopped scrolling through the news feed once I realized its manufactured 
t1_dtre0db	1	*	Yes, we have bars. I moved to SLC from out-of-state, and everyone made it sound like prohibition is still active here. SLC has bars, and good ones too.
t1_dtrkb02	0	*	Instagram is worse then Facebook to be honest. If you don't like Facebook you certainly won't enjoy Instagram. 
t1_dtrf3o9	1	*	i wonder what the 900+ are doing?
t1_dtrd3rq	0	*	I just move to IG. Kept the friends I want to keep and do what you just said. 
t1_dtrq93n	1	*	Shake, bake, shake, Sonora. Make it all the time. 
t1_dtrapex	1	*	Just being polite, eh.
t1_dtrf1we	1	*	It's horrible when you live there. I lived in the south until I was 24. I felt smothered and stuck in quicksand.
t1_dtrdxoo	1	*	You beat me to it. I had no idea that was a thing.
t1_dtsgfa0	1	*	> because they probably had it five tabs deep and didnt notice  ( xb0  xb0)  Tell me more about going deep.
t1_dtrl91i	0	*	Now they're one of the few retailers that are holding down the fort against Amazon while it drives every other big box store out of business.
t1_dtre0nu	1	*	It's because he's 17 or something and Mormon. They aren't allowed to be alone together, don't have sex, and are just waiting to go on their missions or start getting married.
t1_dtra1cb	0	*	No one really has 600 friends.  
t1_dtrcq0c	1	*	I don't really care about karma here other than as a tool to see if I conveyed my thought well to others. With FB, though, likes are personal and I think it affects people on a much different level. 
t1_dtrcgtm	1	*	Ive had to block my mom because she shares EVERYTHING she sees on Facebook. My feed would have be animal videos and missing people posts if I still allowed Facebook to show me her content. 
t1_dtrc9vv	1	*	iirc facebook has made it so that you can have a messenger account separate from an actual facebook account, so you can purely stick with the messaging component and ignore everything else
t1_dtre5wv	1	*	We used to do drugs and then hang out in parking lots.
t1_dtrf3mf	1	*	You might end up missing the barrage of videos though and you won't be able to look through your history..  Use an alt account.
t1_dtrh32e	1	*	To get around that, my mother now sends me every single item she posts on her wall directly to me through messenger as well... (sigh).
t1_dtruq0a	0	*	I don't think you can; it does, in fact, depend on the privacy settings *of that post* (and whether it's a public group/page and such).  This is, actually, kind of an issue.
t1_dtrju7y	1	*	South park has an episode on This and as always they fucking nailed it. 
t1_dtrqfnk	1	*	And ya know what's next... Reddit. Have you seen their redesign? Pretty much how can we add ad space redesign.
t1_dtrqvvo	0	*	> A lot of these newcomers dont get that  You really mean there are a lot of newcomers to facebook? I felt like the vast majority of people have been on facebook for the last several years
t1_dtrxd3u	0	*	Is it an attack helicopter?
t1_dtrsn2m	1	*	No, he's in a movie. They must avoid direct communication for years and it won't be until he makes a big dramatic scene on his father's death bed will he be able to communicate directly. 
t1_dtraglv	1	*	Why did you say the same thing twice?
t1_dtrfjz9	1	*	You should read The Shallows. It does a great job of explaining the phycological consequences of the internet.
t1_dtrclbl	1	*	Put a quarter in your ass
t1_dsj02xo	0	*	Just trying to make a point that there are pretty dangerous places in the USA too and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. I like these cities and it is sad to see them decline. 
t1_dskcox6	1	*	No different from the U.S. then
t1_dsjak3a	1	*	Yeah I mean it's not like people are *addicted* to drugs or anything. The fear of death would cure them right away! /s
t1_dsj6wqw	1	*	It should be 43.89/100,000. I just screwed up my copy/paste. Fixed now.
t1_dt3irpn	0	*	No because I don't import solar lol.
t1_duhuezm	1	*	Oh ok! TIL what a venom was I guess ;-)
t1_dui51rx	1	*	Titanium = heavy.... so your just a troll, ok, good job, bye bye.
t1_duif32m	1	*	It would make them stop wasting them which is the point
t1_duiqqv2	1	*	Might not be their first account. I've been using Reddit for about 7 years, and I had another account for a few years prior to this one though.
t1_duphww5	0	*	Yep unfortunately you are.  World relations are hard to grow and prosper but they sure all easy to ruin.   Years and years of work can be ruined in 6 months. 
t1_duq00d4	1	*	Thats not how tarrifs, trade deals, NAFTA, farm subsidys or swamps work in any way
t1_dup4bsr	1	*	Yep, I remember the stories my grandfather used to tell about the great Midwestern forest, teeming with buffalo.
t1_durbwxg	0	*	I am wrong?  You mean census.gov is wrong?
t1_dtf7sre	1	*	Coop DNR?
t1_dt0bmyk	1	*	i'm sorry and i fixed it, twitter bamboozled me.
t1_dsrrhhu	0	*	You've never been but that desert hole was closed because the state of Nevada found out there is water in the area that ~~if~~ when it gets contaminated will get into the states drinking water.
t1_dut7mgg	1	*	Exactly. Hence, social democracy. 
t1_du6elcr	1	*	Source for both figures?
t1_dubo7f4	1	*	It's okay when they have more stuff than you
t1_dubnfxw	0	*	Tell me more...
t1_dubmw7x	0	*	Not arguing, but I'm curious what actions Hillary could have taken to prevent or mitigatete this.  What are your thoughts?
t1_dubo65s	0	*	All this person did was imply that anti hillary bots existed.  Why would you take that as them claiming Hillary didn't employ bots?
t1_dubu32d	1	*	No more than I 'know about it'. There are lots or more interesting and practical things to read out there.
t1_dubvyco	0	*	He might as well have google'd it and pasted in the first 13 results for all the good that that does.  Quantity is not an adequate substitute for quality.
t1_dubrvqx	1	*	I don't get this people are paid to protest thing that's gotten into peoples heads. That just doesn't happen as far as I'm aware. Maybe they are given food or something at the meeting.
t1_dubovyu	0	*	well, most of their names are totally spanish name to start with
t1_dubmf51	1	*	Perhaps the termites are local, since they are at your building. and not on the other side of the planet?
t1_dubv9ob	0	*	If y'all gun owners would stop supplying all the bodies, then that would be a start...
t1_ducai06	0	*	Holy shit, he has excellent footnotes.
t1_dubq9k6	0	*	Unlike all the *others* I was not programmed to have an opinion.
t1_dubttph	1	*	Damn that's pretty cheap. New plan- I'm gonna by my own army of shill accounts.
t1_dubnhh1	1	*	Nah, it was a good statement on its own. Crassness sullies it.
t1_dubpqkb	0	*	Pretty sure our military would handle invaders. Not Greg from down the street.
t1_dubpsp8	1	*	> The Russians simply want to muddy the waters.  Whoosh 
t1_dubbqxn	0	*	I'm confident in the numerous independent sources not to mention my own observation during the election of how fake news was weaponized by the Trump campaign
t1_dubky3v	1	*	They also supported BLM and other leftest views. 
t1_dubis4d	1	*	Yeah, as a liberal? Many people are falling for that shit.  We dont fall for fake news, but we do fall for other shit. In hindsight it is so obvious how the russians played us. 
t1_dubrcpv	0	*	1 is still Russia related. 10 click view full document... 3 google it. 
t1_dubxos7	1	*	You in a well regulated militia?
t1_dubm8ww	1	*	Spasibo
t1_dubs66k	1	*	It's a Serbian model...but da. I've been found out 
t1_dubrsr9	0	*	March through a college with a torch chanting Jews will not replace us *one night* and all of a sudden you're antisemitic 
t1_dubzoyl	0	*	I'm gonna go ahead an say you don't know anything about film styles or marketing. Also the way you try to be condescending makes you come off as an edgy 14 year old.
t1_ducgv32	0	*	Oh look, a pig from the Donald.
t1_dubulau	0	*	Yeah kinda a guess but trump commands the military right now, so Im not to worried about them.  But anyone else, like China or Russia, bring it. 
t1_dubnxhn	1	*	If they were really casting that broad of a net, it would be much more than ~600 accounts.
t1_dubrcwy	1	*	600 people on Twitter is not that wide of a net. 
t1_ducawm2	1	*	Tell me your secret
t1_dubp5u6	1	*	You're not.  I get a kick out of the fact that the discussion is only ever about Russian bots.  If you have a brain then you know the US does too.
t1_dubm4tu	0	*	They back both, it's not hard to understand. 
t1_dubqprq	1	*	This comment is ironic in itself
t1_ducotol	1	*	I think the shills that guy mentioned showed up on the thread a couple hours after you guys.
t1_dubl9i5	0	*	Yikes
t1_dubncdp	1	*	I don't think she was that technically literate. 
t1_dubf0o6	1	*	Impossible, there's literally no systems in place that allow us to identify people. It would be impossible to make cards or booklets that tell us a person's identity, so there's no use trying.
t1_dubnkt9	1	*	I dunno, I like making jokes and I don't think I'm a shill. I guess I'll stop making jokes on serious discussion, and encourage others to do the same.
t1_dswnyd3	0	*	Good point. I was pinning the racism on the word when in reality it was the context and not the word itself that was to blame.   Euro might even end up being the nationality of a more united Europe.
t1_dsnp08c	0	*	Im curious: what would the worst day of the week to visit be?
t1_dsmkjg8	1	*	That's fine, they'll be hitting each other by then
t1_dsn4z29	0	*	Sure, but the government could definitely cover more than 1% if they are going to claim any credit. 
t1_dtkzxyi	0	*	You would think with the recklessness it would be a huge health crisis already. Drug resistant bugs are no joke.
t1_dtl9uen	1	*	Yeah, along with various government fuckery, sprinkle in a bit of corruption and greed, and you've got yourself a nice little apocalypse brewin 
t1_dtlyjdd	1	*	That's not going to stop all the 3 billion people in China/South East Asia from fucking the rest of us. 
t1_dtkwejk	0	*	You probably felt super badass writing that, but you make it hard for the adults to build a coalition of people with common interests when your first instinct is to antagonize people.
t1_dtl3abl	0	*	??? Did you read my comment? 
t1_dtl91gl	0	*	How is that quiet?  That was literally one of his campaign pledges.   Also, the order itself doesn't remove any regulations at all.    Do you have an example of regulations that have been repealed?
t1_dtlsgjy	1	*	> He was SHOCKED to see surgeons taking their textbooks to surgery with them... on real patients.  Surgeons in the USA use google too.
t1_dtkzkf1	1	*	Consumes was the word I was looking for thanks.
t1_dtl61nn	0	*	And have the corpses have a chance to get ashore? No, you have to burn it all away. Flamethrowers and nukes.
t1_dtkxwbe	0	*	> Maintaining antibiotic resistance has to be somewhat costly for an organism  Can you elaborate on that concept? Or link an article. It's interesting 
t1_dtkyhbg	1	*	uhhhh that's not true at all. if people complain it's because they think it tastes funky (usually trace mineral content, which is harmless) 
t1_dtkufgr	0	*	It is truly sad that people remain *that* ignorant on what theyre fueling their bodies with. Educate yourself people! 
t1_dtl1glt	1	*	It's still mostly due to farming. 
t1_dtl4j1t	0	*	At least you know who to blame! The Chinese and the Indians.
t1_dtl638e	1	*	Also rooting for the zombies 
t1_dtl4bcl	0	*	Counterfit can still mean made in the same factory with the same ingredients, just not branded  Bootleg on the otherhand, that shit would probably kill you 
t1_dtkyf57	1	*	Yellow fever is viral anyhow.
t1_dtl8wc0	1	*	Yes, but we still managed to out-breed all other mammals.
t1_dtkxypg	0	*	If you contribute to the animal agricultural industry than you're part of the problem too mate. 
t1_dtl39f3	1	*	Tyson ceos
t1_dtkzlji	0	*	nice deflection from the post talking about India and it's farming practices
t1_dtl897f	1	*	I couldn't remember the exact wording, but that is exactly what came to mind when I commented.
t1_dtl8ccu	0	*	Isnt that shit they are spraying on fields most likely killing the bees? Or least part of the bee dieoff problem? We are royally fucked if the bees go.
t1_dtky6zr	1	*	It's probably the influence of western culture that's been taking place over there for awhile. Combine that with the lack of regulations and it makes sense to me.
t1_dtldq68	1	*	We still have phage, Russia uses them quite a lot. 
t1_dtl0jda	0	*	So you want a rabies outbreak then
t1_dtks88p	1	*	True.
t1_dtleh7p	0	*	It's also tasty and highly nutritious. Good luck.
t1_dtl67n9	0	*	He's not ragging on GMOs, he's ragging on Monsanto's distribution model, or w/e you'd call it
t1_dtkxhsn	0	*	Then they blame the West upon immigrating to these countries as to why the latter is so strict in awarding the equivalency to the Medical Degrees.
t1_dtlhmu5	1	*	I mean, they can buy beans. They don't *have* to eat cheap meat. Although I see what you are saying, and that is a major issue that needs to be dealt with. 
t1_dtlb674	0	*	I mean thats better than not taking them...
t1_dtm9qec	1	*	> Capitalism has nothing to do with that fact that I can't pay the same price as Americans for certain beers in Ontario.  the fact that you are buying beers is Capitalism, my friend...   
t1_dtla3rv	0	*	Do you want the r&d costs of an antibiotic covered in three years? India can help...  Edit: India will help by selling tons of it to chicken farmers
t1_dtlabg6	1	*	Yeah. The whole article is pretty damning and should make a lot more people concerned than it does.
t1_dtkytuk	1	*	Why is this ignorance tolerated in any country!? 
t1_dtkwmjn	0	*	Well you do. Did that make you stop buying meat?
t1_dtl4ngj	1	*	Yeah, but money. And shareholders. Never forget the shareholders. This is all for them.
t1_dtl6nf0	1	*	Ah, the good old nuclear option. 
t1_dtljp50	1	*	That's idiotic. Those should absolutely be mandatory.
t1_dv7g70b	1	*	At this point I would just let them leave, I don't see what they contribute except for Montreal, and even then I'm take it or leave it 
t1_dthkd02	0	*	Are the sheeple the ones who are paying attention or the ones going about their business as usual
t1_dthbnyy	0	*	Hmm weird how the people who hated her and investigated her repeatedly found that she was utterly innocent....
t1_dtheadd	1	*	Yes he did. The Nunes memo was available for both sides to read for a week.
t1_dthhjbj	1	*	Thats called proving a negative.   Thats not the same as proving that something IS propaganda. Thats proving a positive which is possible.   Ummm... nice try? Not sure what to say honestly. 
t1_dthz480	1	*	Is this satire? 
t1_dth4907	1	*	O look, a car chase
t1_dthcmo7	0	*	Doesn't matter if your name is supposed to sound the opposite, if your goal is to silence opposing views, you are a fascists. 
t1_dthh4vu	0	*	Which ones?
t1_dthius3	0	*	That may be true in a sense, but news networks also give information. One of these networks spews out the blacks are dangerous, and you should have the right to discriminate against gay people. 
t1_dthbyc5	1	*	Dossier is a crazy distraction for pizzagate.  Birth Certificate actually belonged to... *Seth Rich.*  Gravity is just a theory and a spherical Earth has never been proven!  Wanna be friends?
t1_dtiwqjv	1	*	Monitoring the phones of the AP and not only obtaining records of fox news journalist but his parents too.
t1_dthiq7a	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dthn5zz	1	*	Thats fine but I dont understand what your point is. Someone said its fake and I asked for evidence that its fake. All youre saying is that it sounds fake. 
t1_dthdrcp	1	*	The 25th Amendment can potentially be used to oust Trump, if the right people decide that hes too mentally unstable to lead. 
t1_dti6mys	0	*	Thanks a lot.
t1_dtifhyc	1	*	that's not how polled percentages work, they're given more options than just yes or no 
t1_dthdl4f	0	*	Are you saying Lake Placid wasn't a documentary?
t1_dthgh1w	0	*	If an insane racist hate-cult sends a messenger, their message should automatically not be believed.  P.S. /r/conspiracy is an insane racist hate-cult.  
t1_dthf72w	1	*	Great post. And I would follow up by noting, if any of this laundered money comes from Russian sources, then it is *well* within the purview of Mueller's investigation.
t1_dthwcfn	0	*	Thank you for the /s. You don't know how many of us were ready to jump all over you, lol. I bet I could find a similar, but totally sincere, quote in very little time on the intertubes.
t1_dthi07h	1	*	Good Ol' PoppinKream, providing enough reading material to make me have trouble sleeping at night =\.  Thanks for all your links though :)
t1_dtksa8t	0	*	Wouldn't that mean studying climate patterns? That's a specific area. Saying study physics makes it sound like you are just throwing out a broad term because you don't know what you're talking about. 
t1_dthonnr	1	*	Exactly, go back to your shithole subreddit.
t1_dthckz8	1	*	Yeah mostly thanks to immigrants. For example, 1/3 of American Nobel prize winners.

t1_dthdm25	1	*	It never says they did...
t1_dthfrp2	0	*	Do you physically hold the evidence, or does someone tell your news source that they have evidence and then you believe the news source when they relay the information to you?
t1_dthwi6w	1	*	After a one party system the number of parties loops around to potentially infinite parties, like a stack overflow, depending on the population. One man, one vote, one political party. Anarchy! 
t1_dthcd4z	1	*	Are you saying she obstructed justice? Surely there would have been a slam dunk case in one of those 13 investigations. 
t1_dthfyza	1	*	How do you not understand you pay for it one way or another? It's just more expensive the way we're paying for it now.

t1_dthil9v	0	*	That has nothing to do with cargo cults that I can tell. Maybe I am thinking of something totally different. Explain a reverse cargo cult. 
t1_dthaeoz	0	*	Thats not how you do investigations. You find ALL the evidence then present 
t1_dth7obc	0	*	I keep hearing this pleaded guilty talking point as if it has anything to do with Trump or Russian influence over the election. Is it the only thing you have to substantiate the dossier?

t1_dv0tl0k	1	*	Or the United State during the civil right era. Democracy doesn't necessarily include the whole population. If a large portion of the populous is disenfranchised prepare for civil unrest.
t1_dv088r5	1	*	No shit. The government controls the media and silences all critics. Meanwhile they do actually have a very good economic record.

t1_ds37fy7	0	*	Not just military expansion, but they're also investing heavily in alternative routes with projects such as OBOR and CPEC.
t1_ds2nk1u	0	*	the US isn't declining. The US is simply growing slower, because guess what, China has like 4x the number of people.  Why should the US rule the world? There is no good reason for it.

t1_dtg9dwe	0	*	Well you certainly found something imperfect to support. I'll give you that.

t1_dtgiext	0	*	Oh you're doing that bot thing where you just spout things no matter what people reply to you huh

t1_dth5oe2	1	*	I don't think he's quite as dumb as you think. Most dumb things he says/does serve a purpose of cementing his base or undermining an opponent. 
t1_dtgl2np	0	*	Sec. 230 (and a few other sections of the law) have guidelines of what needs to occur for the US to lift these sanctions. So the WH saying Oh, we don't need them anymore is ridiculous.

t1_dtgirlw	0	*	Does that matter? Issues are no less pressing just because people have done similar acts in the past. 
t1_dtgqesl	1	*	I hope he does. Because if Trump goes into the 2020 RNC unopposed as republican nomination for president, this country will burn. 
t1_dtiau6c	1	*	I'm not. I was just against that bullshit when Obama pushed it and allowed it to occur. 
t1_dtgjs55	1	*	Hey I'm sure the incumbent has had great reasons every time he's arrested his challengers. 
t1_dthsj4k	1	*	And yet it still more than ecstatic to keep collecting that pay check.      I wish I could get paid to argue that I should have to do as little as possible.

t1_dtgn3ni	1	*	Create some good and use it to entice Pence and Trump to change their ways!
t1_dtgmp3r	0	*	That would require Dems to have a spine left to find.  What we'll probably get instead is more talk of healing the nation or closing the divide.
t1_dtgv7rt	0	*	It's a false choice. 
t1_dtgtvwc	1	*	Trump won't be convicted either though.
t1_dtgq1vs	1	*	Lol the overlord class will never instruct their political employees to fix Citizens United. Thats just never going to happen.

t1_dtyraby	1	*	This is such a weird comment. Are you Charlie Sheen?

t1_dt4u1kw	1	*	I thought Corbyn made it clear that he would legalise cannabis, at least medicinally and decriminalise drugs as a whole?
t1_dt50gro	1	*	That's because the UK is general quite a left-leaning country - But the Tories under May are prudish.  This is a government that banned face sitting in porn.

t1_duwoe4f	0	*	I was talking about residency which seemed to me to be after the third year. Maybe after the fourth. In any case thats the average salary of engineers out of school, so that's pretty good.
t1_duwogja	1	*	And before that it was Obamas and before that ... after working in management for a decade one thing Ive learned is that everyone likes to bitch about everything.
t1_duwrjam	0	*	Is it that they don't want the responsibility? Or that doctors/administration simply don't allow them to sign off on those things?
t1_duwlud8	0	*	I think they were implying during residency, when he is correct, there is minimal pay at that time which barely covers books, regulatory requirements etc.  
t1_duwzt4z	0	*	They're usually the best part, Steve......here have a beer and go sit at the bar
t1_duxwaao	1	*	I just came up with a brilliant idea. Instead of giving one person so many hours that they want to quit...just hire a full and a part time to fill that same shift.
t1_duwrjsk	0	*	But the majority dont. Its disingenuous to compare the median salary for nurses to anecdotal evidence points.   In 2014 the average person who graduated with a bachelors degree made $48k.
t1_duwrksj	0	*	Fuck, I can't believe a first world country has an actual supply problem for qualified doctors. The trouble finding access seems like a huge issue.

t1_duwulcj	0	*	Ironic does not mean what you think it does.
t1_duwltwe	1	*	The personal responsibility of being a nurse and just somehow getting more money? Go beat yourself off somewhere else.
t1_dux3bal	1	*	Exactly! An extra 4-6 years of school + residency is a lot harder to replace than a BRN.

t1_duvu0m8	0	*	My reasoning for what? It is very straightforward as to why you would increase punishment as a deterrent in a location where crime is prevalent.
t1_dsa7fdn	0	*	It was - I do not deny it, but there were also territories where Poles were more than 50% of population and those areas were also given to  USRR and population from them were forced to resettlement.
t1_ds8lvol	0	*	Czech Rebublic is the official name, Czechia is officially recognised shorter version - kind of like United State of America and USA.

t1_du6x51m	1	*	Yeah no lol
t1_du6wva0	1	*	Fun fact, the US has lobbying disclosure laws, and the EU does not.  Its assumed that lobbying is a bigger industry in Europe than in the US.
t1_du6n3sf	1	*	The rules set out to define what is fair. Now explain if it is fair that China can do this but prevent other foreign entities from doing the same in China. I'm right so deal with it. 
t1_dud3hb5	0	*	My worry is more that they're not looking into it very deeply right now for fear of getting their head cut off. Could just be a leak free ship with that regards though. 
t1_dtaui3r	1	*	My pleasure, have a great day!
t1_du8t6h7	0	*	Orwell, he did 1984 as well.   Huxley was a Brave new world. 
t1_dub9i88	1	*	An American propaganda outlet tries to shit on Chinese leaders? OH NO!  In the meantime, your article doesn't support the claim that Xi is corrupt.
t1_dua23yw	0	*	Xi Jinping has more integrity in a single hair than the entirety of the American Senate, Congress, and White House combined.

t1_du6z8c7	0	*	If you're really talking hypotheticals, it's a lot more likely the US would nuke someone again than it is another nation could set a meaningful military force on American soil.
t1_du7cvhl	1	*	Well Nazi Germany was also destroyed, the US was not
t1_du778u7	0	*	This practice is older than the Ukraine conflict. The U.S. killed many Soviet advisers in Grenada, Vietnam, and Korea.  
t1_du6vw58	0	*	What's what they said before WW1
t1_du6jdgs	0	*	Yes they are ethnic Russians, but also Ukrainians. 
t1_du6ppij	1	*	The F-22 could have been used as a FAC-A to take some of the pressure off the JTACs on the ground. Controlling that much air is extremely difficult. 
t1_du7erv5	1	*	They do.. Very deep ties. The owner of Walton group is putin's good friend. 
t1_du6jc65	0	*	If they wanted to fight ISIS, they'd probably be focusing on US-supported rebels. Daily reminder that Russia is backing the Syrian government and the US... is backing anyone who isn't, including ISIS.

t1_dt8gohr	1	*	Wartime incumbents even....
t1_dt7w2na	1	*	And is now a private citizen

t1_dtvk09o	1	*	Absolutely but it gets more varied at salaried management level. There is also a new start rate which is slightly lower for a few months but then goes up. 
t1_dtu3l8r	0	*	Depends on what they are used for!  
t1_dv3ocjq	0	*	What does that even mean?
t1_dt655xt	1	*	Its funny because almost all of the US bases in proximity to the Russian Federation are older than 1990...Its a funny joke.

t1_dtgmam2	0	*	Dude, one can say the same thing about how urban people, especially youth, being massively disrespectful towards people living in rural areas.
t1_dthqmhn	1	*	This is why I also have trouble attributing the blame entirely on Russia. We created this situation for ourselves by valuing the dollar over education and a healthy mind.
t1_dthf6ho	0	*	Try harder, you sound desperate. 
t1_dtgd1r2	1	*	Yeah but she would've pulled us into war with Russia...except Trump is doing the same thing so there's no advantage to voting for him.

t1_duw3xdc	0	*	Oh, well if Monsanto says it's all cool, then who am I to argue with them?
t1_dtqd4ou	1	*	This. Many people don't understand that Hamas (not every one in Gaza though) want everything and no jews in Israel. This fact always seems to be overlooked in debates.
t1_ds5qeqj	1	*	Well, it *is* a female team
t1_dt4qfle	1	*	They're not judging you for having compassion. Don't judge them for hating an attempted mass murderer. Compassion is great but socially enforced compassion? No thanks. 
t1_dtx9x9u	1	*	what a fantastic comeback.
t1_dtxi21m	1	*	That's not how the EU works
t1_dtwve74	1	*	Didnt know that, thanks for the info. I guess in Portugal it would be similar which is why there were so many protests about the nato base that was eventually closed.

t1_ds58lr1	1	*	Oh please.

t1_dsd514z	1	*	Ok so, Gibraltar should be spaniard then.

t1_dt23xxv	0	*	Yeah, fuck billionaires for pocketing the profit of the business that they've started. They should just hand over the profit to their employees, who has already been paid for their work once. 
t1_dt2033k	0	*	It *clearly* says top 1% earn. It even specifies that it's just for wealth generated in 2017 (read: one year income).
t1_dt2qwvc	1	*	I assumed you meant competitive edge as in rigging the system somehow, having reread it tho puts it more in perspective

t1_dt1u1hp	1	*	Ah yes that's the one, TY. Didn't have the link so I had to regurgitate whatever I remember. Certainly one of the most memorable comments I've seen on this site.
t1_dt2glyv	1	*	And most poor people think of everything in terms of consumption (spending) instead of equity and saving.

t1_dt617fl	0	*	Pssst.  They dont correlate as well as they should. As productivity has gone up over the last 30 years compensation has not. 
t1_dt4qybj	0	*	So he could have 100trillion dollars and 30grand would still be 1%. What a useful measure of wealth.
t1_dt27pml	0	*	A system requiring constant growth and consumption on a planet with limited resources is totally sustainable? That's some industrial strength kool-aid

t1_ds6ypy5	0	*	I don't follow. How is there suffering if no pain is felt?
t1_ds6mww0	0	*	You're sure, huh? Also, that would not be the same as people actually protesting it, your original claim.

t1_dswimej	0	*	I like how the right wing likes to set made up specific rules on what exactly true socialism is. And any slight deviation is no longer socialism therefore any socialist model doesn't work in any form.
t1_dsw156l	0	*	actually I'm in favor of a border less world where anyone can go anywhere anytime they want to for any reason they want.

t1_dsvisiu	1	*	You're technically right, the best kind of right.
t1_dsuu4fl	0	*	Still not charity. Charity is giving to United Way or something. This is a mutual benefit, a win-win as it were.

t1_dsv39lu	1	*	Hey, butt face, it's not just Haitian's over staying their Visa's.
t1_dsvtohf	1	*	We dont need unskilled labor from anyone. We have enough. All unskilled immigration does is hurt Americas working class. Its basic supply and demand

t1_dsuvnrs	0	*	The entire premise for your argument is that there is no way to stop overstays other than outright banning work visas, which is untrue, meaning yes, numbers are what we should be focused on.
t1_dsuuhu7	0	*	Allow me to amend my original statement. Give me a source of Trump saying it BEFORE he suddenly used it to cover his ass after the racist remarks. You can't all pretend this was his plan all along. 
t1_dsv42ch	0	*	I'm not assuming anything. Also, every immigrant isn't working for lower wages.

t1_dsurnqw	1	*	so what?

t1_dsutjxz	1	*	We're setting our bar for comparison to Germany's refugee crisis?
t1_dswjyzm	1	*	tell that to the e-coli that gets spread to the produce section.  It's an ass-backward culture that thinks shitting outside is OK.  A real shithole culture.
t1_dsuy282	1	*	It's called American exceptionalism, exceptional in the sense of being different not necessarily better, and it's a double edged sword

t1_dsvazuo	0	*	You asked why they want to come to the U.S. I explained why. Not sure what you're ranting about now.

t1_dujdfzj	1	*	Anal sex and IV drug use are the two most common means of transmission.  In the US, IV drug use is 7%, and everything else that doesn't involve anal sex combined is less than 1%.
t1_dujse3l	1	*	It's not just LGBT, there are people with disabilities or conditions that find solace in sitting behind a desk answering phone calls than having to deal with people face to face.

t1_dsxgjca	0	*	Thank you for proving me correct.  I suggest you prepare yourself, pleb.
t1_dsvjyf0	0	*	I'm not accusing. It's a fact that stupid people connect the dots. Every negative Israel comment inadvertently supports the anti Semitic crowd. Just like calling countries 'shit holes'
t1_dsvkk3o	0	*	I dislike Freidman but the only evidence I can find of dual citizenship is from globalresearch.ca citing christians in defense of Israel, neither a reliable source

t1_dskprgb	1	*	I'll put stock into the why if we actually got the full, direct context of what he said, not whatever cherry-picked nonsense was leaked by partisan agents trying to undermine Trump. 
t1_dskn2as	0	*	If you think the standard of living between America and Haiti isn't just a teensy bit wider than between Norway and America, you're an idiot.
t1_dskjb4z	1	*	Justify it any way you want. The President has verbal diarrhea and that is not a quality anyone should look for in a leader.  This guy couldn't manage a McDonald's is what I'm saying.
t1_dsk6tyc	1	*	Youre right, only adults are obligated to act like adults.   Understandably neither you nor Trump have a frame of reference for that discussion.
t1_dslv6w8	1	*	>We need all the allies and friends we can get.  Haiti has no value as an ally any friendship is a purely one sided deal where they get free shit and we get nothing. 
t1_dskme1u	0	*	Sounds like large parts of the Republican Party would like to turn the US into a shithole then. A nice corrupt state that they can use to line their pockets. Russia basically. 
t1_dsk4fyg	1	*	He does if he doesn't want to denigrate the dignity of the oval office.
t1_dskjabh	0	*	Most shithole countries had western influence at some point in their history. Western countries have done a very good job of fucking up third world countries.
t1_dsls01y	0	*	Nope. I'm saying don't cast stones at other countries when you can't even provide clean water in your own.
t1_dslik8y	0	*	But Trump supporters are Republicans, who are less likely to be unemployed. Your point doesn't make any sense and is not supported by facts.
t1_dslvdds	1	*	Heh Haiti. Yea, that was fucked up. How about a gin and tonic on us?
t1_dskox1w	1	*	Back then yeah. Especially for commoners

t1_du0z2wr	1	*	pharmacognosy is not the same as homeopathy. 
t1_du1fi5e	0	*	They're not diluting it too much, they think it is stronger the more you dilute it.  It is just 100% craziness.
t1_du1erwb	1	*	I said the exact opposite. I said a person doesn't dedicate their life to academia or sociology for the money. They do it because they have a passion for it. 
t1_du790x5	1	*	Lean, yeah, you said robotripping I just went with the cough syrup thing.   But yeah I get ya now.  
t1_du0xytf	1	*	That says absolutely nothing about the coursework.

t1_dsxd7xe	1	*	Turkey wasn't obligated to do anything and allow anything to cross over. In hindsight it would've been smarted to block everything and just watch as IS exterminates the PKK. Big mistake.

t1_dsybs4b	0	*	A lot of Turks like Turkey, American, Kurdish or Greek influence over them would radicalize a big portion of the population. Now the US would have another country to play wack o' mole in.

t1_dubfuem	0	*	It can be used for bartering. Often is.  And nah bud I bought in 2012 :). Sorry you regret not having foresight.
t1_dubhkav	0	*	Really, and how do you think people pay for shit on the darkweb - money orders?
t1_dubmuyc	1	*	If it does, that's fair, doesn't mean it isn't an accepted currency.
t1_dtj5p3u	0	*	hahahaa

t1_dt2xrd3	0	*	I dont think you have the slightest clue about the subject. Just stop talking about it rofl, make you look pretty dumb.
t1_dtf62bh	1	*	On reddit it can be any of your suggenstions depending on who posts the comment.
t1_dtbut5i	1	*	230 million people are ready to kill or die for it? Doubt it. Get medical help btw.
t1_dtca4fv	0	*	I have to wonder if the highly advertised Muslim extremist attacks triggered white extremists to new heights. After all, isnt a race war what the supremacists want?
t1_ds9zrdj	1	*	As fake as Star Trek. So... no.

t1_ds9yk3w	1	*	Both what?
t1_dsa2vnk	1	*	You didn't choke to death on stollen. A true christmas miracle.
t1_dsacpjv	0	*	And lots of things weren't native to Canada when the whole thing was under four kilometers of ice. What's your point?
t1_dsa34hk	0	*	They needed protein and some animals had to die. The only difference here is that the producers picked which animals that would be and filmed it. I don't find that evil.
t1_dsa3l80	0	*	Do you eat meat? Do you want to think the animals care why they are being killed? 
t1_ds9yhig	0	*	That's the active duty one, right? It's harder to get into than 21 and 23? Something like that.
t1_dsduckh	1	*	You're right.
t1_ds9yivq	1	*	You'd have to be cherry picking to not come to that conclusion. The only people who wouldn't fall into that group are fundamentalists. 
t1_dsa38cn	1	*	A great deal of toxins survive boiling tbh.

t1_ds9z16t	1	*	Technically invasive means humans fucked up somehow and now its goddamn everywhere.   If it gets somewhere on its own its migration.

t1_ds9y0ub	1	*	I disagree, it implies that they solely have to find it, not hunt for it. 
t1_dsa21m4	1	*	The point is that farm animals are specifically bred for numbers. We'd have to try REALLY hard to kill more of them than we breed.
t1_ds9z8ah	1	*	Weil es die Wahrheit ist!
t1_dsjo9kj	0	*	That's a fact. Saying it is irrelevant is an opinion, and saying that it isn't newsworthy is arguably a lie seeing as this story has been widely reported in the news.
t1_dttib8x	1	*	I don't think google trends is the best metric for that m8. Also they're not banning a specific phrase. 
t1_dsi53z7	1	*	Wow.  Ok, sure, Donald, you're the most successful real estate mogul businessmen, that's not really debated.  Who's Donald Bren then?   
t1_dsi1xz1	1	*	I'm pretty sure it is debated, heavily. However perhaps I'm wrong, would you care to educate me on the factuality of this claim?

t1_dtslxoo	1	*	There are many crypto companies that have incredible working products. Factom is a good example. 
t1_dts9vyc	1	*	Thank you. Bitcoin went from a few dollars a few years ago to a few thousand dollars now, which is not so bad. It going sour now, but my personal belief is that it still has a great future.

t1_duad2nz	0	*	Obama doubled the national debt to achieve what he did, and also inherited a country in a recession.
t1_duaau50	1	*	I get the feeling a lot more people would've voted if Clinton wasn't given a 99% chance to win. They won't let the idiots of America speak for them again and elect someone like him. 
t1_duaf1g5	1	*	Or worse: Trump.
t1_dua6jgk	0	*	I have no clue what you are on about, I voted remain.

t1_duadkbu	0	*	Well you go first
t1_dua5dnd	1	*	I think you misunderstand. [Newscorp](https://newscorp.com/who-we-are/) is news (I use that term loosely) company owned by rupert murdoch. Fox News ring any bells?
t1_duabhe9	0	*	It's really not a simplification. From countries included in freedom of movement, there is no upper limit on the amount of migration. Hence unlimited migration from those countries. 
t1_duabbfu	1	*	You dont think youd lose legitimacy by going through with something so harmful by choice?
t1_duahdgy	1	*	Evidence?  Most of? Such as?

t1_dua8xse	1	*	Corbyn is anti-EU. It is why he wont campaign for stay. 
t1_duaqkng	0	*	Seems to me that more people voted against Trump than for Hillary. She didn't enthuse the demographics she should have.
t1_duahwdk	0	*	When speaking to people from the area, the general feeling is that they feel left out anyway, that this part of the country has been abandoned.
t1_duaddr1	1	*	Shit, the US citizens voted against Dolt 45 last year lol. 
t1_duadh2p	0	*	No, it won't. 
t1_dua8pz5	0	*	That is just an immature opinion.  FDR put fucking citizens in concentration camps so don't give me no bullshit about being the worst. 
t1_dua8eww	0	*	not sure, i'm very ignorant about this matter tbh
t1_dua9tt8	0	*	Legally, yes it can.  The referendum was non-binding.    If the government wants to reverse Brexit, it's entirely possible.  
t1_duaacbd	1	*	Not going to happen.
t1_dua9242	1	*	Very British though. 
t1_duadwtv	0	*	And Wales. Everybody forget Wales !
t1_duabwdp	1	*	There are no positive aspects to social media. Your comment shows that things have to get a lot worse before people realize that.
t1_duaw4ut	1	*	No I think I laid out my argument for his shittiness. If you disagree, that's your prerogative. 
t1_duanmdd	1	*	Exactly. You can't expect anything with such a huge consequence. 
t1_du9xpci	1	*	Perfect, that's how most people use reddit anyway.
t1_dua870q	1	*	Oh, theres plenty of consequences. Just not for the liar. 
t1_duakn8r	0	*	You were lied to.  Whether that was why you voted the way you did, only you know.  But you were lied to.
t1_dua29mp	1	*	Haha oh wow, that's all you got?  Enjoy competing with China, I'm sure you're totally come out of it as the victor.
t1_duacb5r	0	*	Faster doesn't mean better. Look at Japan's words.
t1_dubwjwm	1	*	I bet nursing jobs will now be so much more easier to get for the real citizens. Oh wait, were there job openings before brexit and in dire need of more nurses?
t1_duakjcy	0	*	The whole of the UK should age had the vote for Scotland to leave.  You guys voted to stay by a large majority. I'd have voted you out due to the lack of contribution to the UK economy, personally. 
t1_duagcwn	0	*	Of course they wouldn't.   Which is why they haven't.  
t1_duayeeq	0	*	Honest question, do you think Japans record low crime rate would remain so if they took in their fair share of refugees?
t1_dua4tn6	0	*	fools got fooled.
t1_duags83	0	*	I know how short-handing is done.   However, this is titled to be at least talking about the government in a large sense, not a company.
t1_duc7v9u	0	*	That does not mean it is a foreign government since the british have representation. 
t1_dudzbsw	0	*	Refugees are your priority, but you cannot decide the priorities for others.

t1_dtar7d1	1	*	They're still getting days off every week, and in most cases I'd say it's two days off  The pubs are still allowed to close anyways 
t1_dts57vz	1	*	I suspect that line of reasoning may have entered the Appeal Judges' minds but for obvious reasons you won't see it expressed in such open terms in the Judgment.
t1_dsug3wg	1	*	I tried to say that but Reddit downvoted me lol, people dont like history clearly 
t1_dstt5nr	0	*	most of france in that day wasn't that homogenous so it can apply to all, but the elite spoke indeed french and culturally they were way more integrated  imo it's a bit cherry picking at this point

t1_duqutlm	0	*	Except there is a historic number of house GOP retiring and that will be enough to bring significant investigations against our criminal president.
t1_duqxxe9	1	*	i've heard they have the capability to shit just one leg of the pant. The other is allowed to remain free for other liberal related ideas at that point in time.
t1_duqwhzi	1	*	Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Ugh. Lets ignore educated individuals, instead lets elect those that lack any experience, in every field!!

t1_duqt0f2	1	*	Fingers crossed

t1_dstheb4	0	*	No, this is exactly the kind of kneejerk reaction that will ensure degradation of the human species.  Think a few hundred years ahead instead of next quarter.

t1_dtcy3i3	0	*	The US has pressured them into compliance  a total number of zero times so far. Seems like a winning strategy!
t1_dte9zvz	1	*	duh, isn't it self-evident? the sanctions exist because not a single UNSC member vetoed them. including Russia.   in fact most if not all resolutions were unanimous.

t1_dstqil9	0	*	Is that a yes?
t1_dstbku7	1	*	I think you are giving him too much credit.  Roy Moore is a huckster, not a holy man.  He likely doesn't believe in religion at all, beyond its utility to control the proles.  
t1_dssxcfb	0	*	Yeah, because Trump is too poor and above suing a random author. He just knows what the outcome would be
t1_dst0f6h	1	*	It's not.
t1_dstbom5	0	*	So the comments section of Breitbart? 
t1_dsugsrf	1	*	Zing!
t1_dsthudr	1	*	The voters aren't gonna fix shit. They're gonna show up at the polls and vote in more lizards. 
t1_dst9tvh	1	*	thanks for the great replies. Yeah and they're doing it with posts about like aziz ansari convincing dems to vote online which you can't do, and meddling with our net neutrality too 
t1_dstapl9	1	*	Thankfully they're dumb.
t1_dspvpcm	1	*	You fail to understand the difference between a moral and legal argument. Good bye.
t1_dspj7xj	1	*	So, Santa Cruz Maricon, I suggest you get Danish citizenship, then run for office, and change the law.  And stop posting stuff that makes you look at best an apologist for kiddy porn.

t1_dspivcq	1	*	Yes. 
t1_dspi21s	1	*	You make it sound like that's way outside the norm.  In most U.S. states age of consent is 16 or 17.
t1_dv2o0xd	0	*	I agree to a point but once again our politicians are either too stupid or make too much money the way it right now. It's sad but true
t1_dsd6upl	1	*	That makes a certain amount of sense.  If they are in talks they won't fuck around with nuke tests during the winter olympics.

t1_dt7bkeo	0	*	I got a refund because i put money into RRSPs. if i didn't, I would have had to pay. You know single and no kids no free credits because apparently single kidless folks dont deserve them.
t1_dt6tuk5	0	*	Yes they do. Some pay more. Thats the average.
t1_dt6re5m	1	*	Sorry, but no. Every one of us who is not conservative is disenfranchised by the current system. I had to vote against my conscience last election just so my vote would count at all.

t1_dt6ojud	1	*	didn't say the tax code was perfect, far from it. I'm just saying that the notion that the 35% US tax code was keeping GM from having plants in the US is untrue.
t1_dt72bfd	1	*	While that is largely true, it does not at all impinge upon Canada's sovereignty.
t1_dt6ks0p	1	*	Bahahahhhh. Wanna bet ?   He can only get by on his hair and socks for so long.

t1_dt7alw0	1	*	Yeah, it depends on the costs/benefits, but at its core it's still a race to the bottom, especially with decentralized corporations
t1_dt75ll6	1	*	Yeah but from microeconomics 101, the only relevant metric in terms of behavior and incentives is at the margin.
t1_dt71st3	1	*	Actually, marginal tax rate is up to 54% (N.S.).

t1_dtaygsl	1	*	Because they can most afford it, i.e. a p progressive tax.
t1_dubuj36	1	*	Sure. Corsica is French - but it's an island. Just south of the French Riviera (French South cost).  
t1_dt6prth	0	*	They're really not.  Politics outside of the US is not usually anywhere near as polarised. Don't assume the rest of the world is as politically crippled :)
t1_dt6vt9b	1	*	So does Germany, but that doesn't make it socialist either.
t1_dt6p8ul	1	*	Only on the internet. In the real world, people are just fed up with all the screeching hysteria and are voting overwhelmingly centralist (in the EU)
t1_dt6q2jc	0	*	That names can be misleading. The Nazis are not socialist, even though it's in their name. Please don't play dumb.
t1_dt6qhs5	1	*	how were they not nationalists? Just because one part of a name is misleading doesn't mean that all names ever created are misleading.

t1_duc9v9m	0	*	We don't have mandated gun safes. It's legal to have an unsecured gunrack in your car in some states.
t1_dui8csx	0	*	Youve been watching too much right wing entertainment. They love associating immigrants with murderers and gang members. Really appears to affect your world view. 
t1_duhnoz6	0	*	CN server you can't touch the main menu girl anymore. They won't move and your relationship status won't increase. The clothing were reworked as well, especially the former captain's.

t1_dspkv6z	0	*	> Conservative groups and news outlets are running increasingly hostile ads trying to demonize the left.  Like political ads showing white people trying to run over minorities?
t1_dspfyjx	1	*	In London maybe, that certainly is reflective of working wages for the majority of the country
t1_dspv6uo	1	*	Just to be clear you think that 46k is pathetic and 80-100k isnt much?
t1_dsq94pd	0	*	Same. I have a variety of auto-immune diseases to go along with the depression. I don't qualify for any disability, so, I just have to suffer.

t1_dtl2t3e	1	*	Haha - Nono - everyone needs to carry acid around. That way well all be safer. /s
t1_dtkxyds	1	*	I still haven't seen any mass school acid attacks that killed hundreds. So I think we're still better off.

t1_dsk3tpw	0	*	Spanish Acquisition 
t1_dtthg8s	0	*	No offense but your country seems to be going backwards like Turkey especially after your new law which makes atheism a punishable offense.  
t1_dupyhwk	1	*	> You realize part of the methodology is how they acquired the statistics, right?  This literally makes no sense and I don't think you understand what methodology means.  
t1_dur71uy	0	*	Im sure all the women you know are just dying to line up and share their most traumatic life experiences with you 
t1_duq6777	1	*	That's a rebuttal to a different study. 
t1_duq5ntu	0	*	Well, I think asking is a good first step. If I want to have sex with my girlfriend, I'm not gonna assume that she wants to too. And sometimes that means asking if she wants to. 
t1_duut9ab	1	*	one in eight.  rationals are a subset of the reals.
t1_duqawbi	0	*	That is admittedly sloppy statistics, but does it make that much of a difference if it's 22% or 24%?
t1_duqzwpb	0	*	I think its worse because of the betrayal and the confusion and sometimes the woman cant always get out of the marriage/home immediately. 
t1_duq4b8g	0	*	so don't try to imply that this statistic has anything to do with immigration then
t1_ds7p421	1	*	Pardon me?

t1_dthnwzd	1	*	Love is hate.
t1_dtgqs1d	1	*	It's only through victory are their chains broken. They must rise to conquer the challenge, and overcome it. So many people do not understand the sith code. 
t1_dtii26q	1	*	Ignorance is strength
t1_dsmpy5x	1	*	Only if you have the favours perk that lets you call for a bail whenever you get busted.  Requires the Rich Parents or Corporate Connections perk.

t1_dsn2z23	1	*	Amy Longer is always too late for anything you want, don't involve her. Basically any time you bring her up it's we're not doing that Amy Longer or they don't make those Amy Longer

t1_dsmrfn5	1	*	They are supporting their side no matter what. They believe that support is making the nation better. Whats not to get? 
t1_dtsrv8p	0	*	It was about them and their opinion of the US' new ideas about having smaller nuclear weapons which is what my comment was about so it was on topic.

t1_dtq8o32	0	*	So the previous 5 months of continues bombing of Japanese cities was just for funsies? 
t1_dtqb656	0	*	Therefore all the world's problems should be blamed on America. Anime is the root of all evil
t1_dtq9f2l	0	*	But to what extent do people know of the horrors? Its easy to read a history book and see blackened bodies and know this is horrible, its another thing to read the personal accounts.

t1_dsgtbj4	0	*	Maybe you should tell that to this girl's parents.
t1_dsguo88	0	*	Owning a gun doesn't solve all the world's problems. And there are many places where guns are not permissable such as where I work.
t1_duwmzjn	1	*	I just happen to agree with you.  What you are advocating is the middle ground.
t1_duculkm	0	*	They're not. Instead, they go on reddit to complain.
t1_duc9019	1	*	They are taking a risk lending you 250k+ for a home. Would you lend someone that kind of money for 20 years interest free?
t1_duc1dqk	0	*	They're not the benefactor, they're a benefactor. I find its a mutually beneficial relationship. 
t1_dsmda7k	1	*	How about neither then?
t1_dslf0gp	0	*	That's true, any real dirt they obtain they probably wouldn't make public until they got all their use out of the said information first. 
t1_dsbrsiv	1	*	Welcome to my hell, at least it's cool tonight
t1_du960jo	0	*	Article: North Koreans traveling abroad have government minders with them to prevent defection.  You: You're riling us up for war!!!  Give me a fucking break.

t1_dtr5tc6	0	*	Bullshit. How is this photo going to do any of that? You've just had it described to you. Just admit you want the lurid kick of seeing a mutilated corpse. 
t1_du9kta0	0	*	Which is why the 'Big Pharma' excuse is bullshit here. The government is paying for it, we wouldn't get it if we didn't need it.

t1_dv2ahcv	1	*	Regularly replacing reddit account seem like what a hacker would do tbh
t1_duk2x04	0	*	Time to use google, or maybe duck duck go,  because you will easily find resources on this. Including the cases the EU has brought against google, Microsoft and others. 
t1_duhwqsv	1	*	Not quite.  They got done for favouring their browser by preinstalling it.  Not straight up refusing to let you install other browsers.
t1_duh4g3u	1	*	who said it can't leave? It won't, b/c of moneys... 
t1_dt64dg0	1	*	Of coarse i think they knew. Multiple accusations of molestation is not exactly something one forgets about. 
t1_dv4bzov	1	*	Yes, yes, government is a great fiction, and so is the 'alpha male', and so it General Motors. But it's a reality we deal with. This type of 'philosophy' is useless and provides no new information.
t1_dtbcoq9	0	*	Nope.  The US stance on the Northwest Passage is that it is international waters.  Canada's on its own for that one.
t1_dtlg6fz	0	*	You're just being pedantic. I thought maybe with all that literary prowess you might be able to infer what I meant.
t1_dtvir1a	0	*	But can a bunch of ripped Dothraki dudes jerk each other off in gratitude and say no homo in Dothraki or does Dothraki not have no homo?
t1_dug0gd1	0	*	>glass those cunts  I have to ask, what does this phrase mean, to 'glass' someone?
t1_duffpod	0	*	Yes, since over a couple of decades ago.  One was nice, the others were all the worst people in a very rough area.   Violence is their thing.
t1_dsm415u	0	*	I wouldn't trust 1 R Senator, let alone two in a row playing telephone... which is the entirety of support for your assumptions.

t1_dt8igjw	0	*	Yes, and thus this news is relevant.
t1_dt7i2fy	0	*	No, it's mostly because the US isn't willing to fund space programs anymore. We're more focused on aircraft carriers and tax cuts 
t1_dt95ck4	1	*	>  refurbish the main fuel tank  uhh, those burned up on launch and were NEVER reusable..
t1_dt7kntk	1	*	Exactly. As much as I loathe watching hard-won mass drift back down to earth it's probably not worth the effort, given the relative value of the components.
t1_dt7kq3l	1	*	We could make a kickass tree fort out of them.
t1_dt85okw	1	*	They did the math. 
t1_dsmkswb	1	*	I was unaware there were special prosecutors investigating Weinstein.  Again: why is it important to you to believe something so improbable? 
t1_dsmb88q	0	*	Right?  Technically it wasn't against the law!  Oh no? White collar crime isn't really against the laws we've allowed white collar criminals to write? Shocking. 
t1_dsmdk0q	1	*	Hes a trump lackey who simultaneously thinks government is bad but these countries are also bad because they are some imaginary anarchy.

t1_dsmdc4l	0	*	And one final awesome piece of the picture is that you can sell a property for a certificate of ownership. So the only proof you own it is a piece of paper. Kind of like a title for a car.
t1_dsmm6q1	0	*	So how about clueing people in, instead of just being a useless anonymous voice of mockery.

t1_dts9q16	0	*	The problem with that is that private options are inherently disadvantaged when a public option is also available, as the public option has near guaranteed income.
t1_dts3hpi	0	*	It was increased to three years, but it's probably a five year waiting list lol.
t1_dtrl846	1	*	Note that although you may have to pay for an eye test in England, they are FREE in Scotland.

t1_dtk7tx3	1	*	They're working on it
t1_dtkhd0b	1	*	To be fair, you can go to a nurse for free in Sweden. It's only 200 SEK for going to a doctor, with a annual ceiling of around 1500 SEK (~200 USD).
t1_dtkavv8	1	*	The drug was for treating morning sickness for pregnant women, not they're going to die anyway. How is this in any way the same thing other than it being a a drug that wasn't thoroughly tested? 
t1_dtkhgo0	0	*	I hope in a good way. XD they cudded me and did tricks and loved me like a dog or cat would, so they deserved the same respect imo.
t1_dtk9obe	0	*	For me it would be ...
t1_dtl44k3	1	*	Because when you get bit by a rattle snake, you have hours.  You can't just get on a plane and fly to Mexico.  I live 3 hours drive from Mexico in Arizona. I probably still couldn't pull it off. 
t1_dtk8g89	1	*	the fuck?
t1_dujz2bc	1	*	Yeah, I'm sure SS happily got help from inferior races they wanted to imprison and wipe out.
t1_duqt08u	1	*	How could someone 100% support either side in the conflict without being brainwashed? Any reasonable person would realize that both sides share significant blame
t1_dunw48f	1	*	Yeah, I'd argue that _nobody_ has a need for suicide bombers.

t1_dt5b4wh	1	*	Sweet! Development Card!     .....annd its a soldier. Fml.
t1_dt55z8c	1	*	It's unfair for Canadians, their government gives companies little incentive to hire people in Canada.
t1_dt5whx0	1	*	Exactly my point. 
t1_dt59fmz	0	*	Bourbon?  I always thought it was rum and coke.  Am I going crazy?
t1_dt5bpb6	1	*	you didn'te caveat that to say spell definasjhdsfkahsdflh correctly.  without that caveat, you are quite incorrect, just as much as my letter regurgitation there.
t1_dt520oa	1	*	Thanks.  I appreciate the explanation.  
t1_dt5dfwa	1	*	I think you read that wrong, the US wanted less protection
t1_dt5caq6	1	*	>This. The GDP doesn't effect me in a meaningful way.   Stop being so selfish.
t1_dt51a6u	0	*	it's almost like a bunch of Canadians showed up in a thread about our own trade deals, instead of it being 99% American comments about tpp 
t1_dt5mx3g	0	*	Still better than before, and incremental improvements are more likely to be followed anyway. 
t1_dt56vyn	0	*	You really have to be so pedantic?
t1_dt5693b	0	*	Same thing really.
t1_dt5yhzl	1	*	And real wages writ large go up! The cost savings by far outweigh the downward pressure from extra labor capacity leaving the import competing industry.
t1_dt4v5id	0	*	Won't help it, either.
t1_dt5luap	1	*	these are long standing policies. 35% of all radio music sounds like a lot, but there are ton's of loopholes. Drake probably wouldn't be known in the US without it; judge that for what you may.
t1_dt59jv4	1	*	NZ and Australia, but more NZ, are particularly upset with Canada's dairy cartel (dairy management) setup.
t1_dtbsehc	1	*	I got some left over MtG and Vampire cards.
t1_dt5g4vl	1	*	Are you a troll?
t1_dt5o0iu	0	*	Not only that, Canada is a net exporter of energy. Canada relies heavily on hydro and nuclear. Pity about the Climate or i'm sure they'd be all in for Solar as well.
t1_dt5ijpp	0	*	This isnt the same deal, right?
t1_dt5desf	0	*	Its got nothing to do with being selfish psychopaths in my mind. Just cognitive dissonance.   Also, I don't know that the IP laws were that horrible to begin with. 
t1_dt5atie	0	*	I've got two sheep and a wood. What'll that get me?
t1_dt4uszc	1	*	Is there an article that actually states what's in it?
t1_dt5010e	1	*	I'd have done the same if I felt they had any hope at all of displacing Harper at the time. I typically vote conservative.
t1_dt5ac1h	1	*	True, but apparently Trump supports those provisions, so it's clearly morally wrong \s
t1_dt5fnxo	0	*	None of them are academic, though, which is typically the gold standard.   The guardian is notorious for bastardizing interpretations of studies
t1_dt5aw5i	0	*	Good for Canadian exporters, bad for consumers who want to buy anything that's not made in Canada...aka, everyone.
t1_dt6d08b	0	*	That is entirely a political judgement, and not one shared by the majority of Canadians in any province, if you look at Trudeau's favourables vs. Trump's.
t1_dt5lfbk	0	*	All countries can't do that.   Natural resource deposits aren't evenly distributed. 
t1_dt5g71x	1	*	Dude, slow down, and read what you write before hitting save.
t1_dsyst87	0	*	Isn't the US the one trying to save face by playing the I didn't touch you! game by hanging out just outside Chinese bases?  Funnily Americans love to accuse Russians of doing this... 
t1_dv03lh2	1	*	I frankly agree. It needs to be called out and shamed. But every post of your on reddit in Anti-China. I was simply pointing out a bias.

t1_dsrhe1n	0	*	So you mean all those scientists working there don't know what they doin? and your example doesn't make sense.
t1_ds92pm3	0	*	Hes also considered the father of Pakistans nuclear program. Hes contributions to the nation dont get diminished.   Just like how US founding fathers are still revered despite being slave owners. 
t1_ds8pv94	1	*	Because they aren't capable of protecting themselves? The only reason US is all buddies with them is because it needs military presence in the region.

t1_du4xwhs	0	*	Who disproved the steele dossier? I see this so many times by so many people claiming it's been faked but no one ever replies to me when I ask how they know it was faked
t1_du4n4p4	0	*	That information has already led to Flynn and Papadopoulos pleading guilty, and Manafort and Gates being out under house arrest. How can you be so obdurate?

t1_du5b66g	0	*	Source?
t1_du5c869	1	*	I completely agree.  But the difference is that Trump actually is that bad, but nobody on the right will listen because they're thinking that its just the usual bullshit. 
t1_du6yvap	1	*	>and shows about inbreds making homesteads!  I bet you're totally not a complete asshole. lol
t1_du4yh44	1	*	Since 70% don't support Trump that's pretty irrelevant. Also the law is the law and if the judges care about it, that's enough.

t1_du4rote	1	*	My blood pressure just tripled.

t1_dsdiopu	0	*	Its because there is no Sharia law in Bahrain and its a 45 minute drive, or a 15 minute flight. Some people would literally fly to Bahrain, get drunk in the airport, and fly back.
t1_dsrvyfs	1	*	It's called the slippery slope, the more accepting and progressive we get. The more ... abnormal the fringes of society become. 
t1_dsedy1w	1	*	These people are freedom fighters.
t1_dsdy950	1	*	Which is the tyranny.
t1_dsds8da	0	*	I guess I could Google it, but I wonder if hanging death is really instant. Or if just unconsciousness is instant and then death occurs by strangulation.

t1_dsl6axk	1	*	No, the president is still a human who makes human mistakes.

t1_dv2ptjn	0	*	Spreading terrorist propaganda to show how bad they are is still spreading terrorist propaganda.
t1_dv0juqh	1	*	This is a fantastic comment. Left wing vs right wing is an *extremely* oversimplified way of looking at the world. Ideologies don't form a neat straight line. 
t1_dv0vq42	1	*	I'm pretty sure she *did* know.  Now, if there's a large enough public outcry over this, FN can add changing France's speech laws to their platform to increase their support.
t1_dv2446h	1	*	Have they finally done it, I don't think so? Well, we all know the uk is a bit special in that regard. 
t1_dv0tg0x	1	*	If there is someone to complain? Yes.
t1_dv0qbjy	0	*	Would not be fine with that but again it doesn't apply to my country (I think you are more or less describing the US here).
t1_dv0u6t0	0	*	Free speech does not include posting traumatising graphic violence to tens of thousands of unsuspecting followers. She deserves everything shes about to get.
t1_dv1ckz6	0	*	Again. France might jail someone for tweeting. I never said that her speech is protected by french law.. IT CLEARLY ISNT!
t1_dv0ri0m	1	*	Ok, thanks. I can agree with that in absence of being able to come up with anything on the top of my head.
t1_dv0re9u	0	*	Well in fairness we were attacked which is why we got into the war.  We didnt do it to save the French. 
t1_dv145sr	1	*	her positions should be emboldened a bit tbh, they are not bad at all. i mean, is it such a surprise to anyone that ISIS is bad?

t1_dv0o7cs	0	*	No, but i'm familiar with their laws. People getting arrested for harmless tweets is super common in Europe. Anti free speech hate speech laws are rampant in Europe unfortunately.
t1_dv1pzdl	1	*	No, but go ahead and put words in my mouth.

t1_ds4ohr9	1	*	>And I am criticising reddit  You mean you're criticizing that subreddit/subreddit post and the 2 or 3 people that posted what you're criticizing?
t1_ds4x4ks	1	*	Its not a personal bias when its a fact  #MURICA NUMBER 1
t1_ds4pz1k	0	*	Not a point. The US is the country that goes around criticizing countries for doing exactly what they do. Russia doesn't. 
t1_ds4qnf5	0	*	I'm mentioning the soviets because the current tactic stemmed from that time. How is that red baiting?
t1_ds4rbgc	0	*	Sir, you illegally parked your speeder
t1_ds4uqa4	1	*	So what was the platform then?
t1_ds4uuzs	0	*	those people at least had an ideology other than self enrichment.    
t1_ds52cnn	1	*	Doesn't work when the courts are in on the game too (proven fact, for a lot of different counties across the country). 
t1_ds52x0v	1	*	Right. they learned from that one, then got much better at it.
t1_ds5e6t0	1	*	I think most western media suffers from bias, not propaganda.
t1_ds4ue6j	1	*	The idiocracy or the dictatorship state that's murdered tens of millions of its own citizens in the last hundred years?
t1_ds4yuxc	1	*	That sort of depends. There have been plenty of democratically elected leaders who turn around and start murdering the opposition. 
t1_ds6sfjd	1	*	GOAT weirdo
t1_ds56cxh	1	*	It was them promoting the occupy movement like it was some kind of rock concert that made me decide they weren't a serious news source.
t1_ds4rxh3	0	*	Sounds like you weren't there and I bet you the downvotes are from people who were.

t1_ds67jon	0	*	> We absolutely need to improve our law enforcement here in the USA  You really should. You basically live in a police-state right now.  
t1_ds4pbl3	0	*	Yeah, it's really funny how people say US is a police state. In Russia, police is completely unchecked and very violent.

t1_ds4zl7f	1	*	Like the only other president that fought in a war was Eisenhower and he legit laid the foundations to turn the US into a superpower post WWII.
t1_ds4t2b0	1	*	on that basis no country can ever criticize any other about anything
t1_ds4tzaz	0	*	They didn't try. Saying they tried to kill the occupy protesters is silly. If our government wanted to kill us it would do so. They have the tools.
t1_ds4xjdj	0	*	Yes, but youd be a hypocrite to do so. A serial killer is in no position to call out the moral failings of a speeder.
t1_ds4ogio	0	*	It's also wrong to pose the US as a singular, rational actor in foreign policy.  Our foreign policy is directed by a constellation of economic and political actors for their own particular benefit.
t1_ds4tbws	0	*	Well, if the riot took place where we determine later that the kid was at fault, then it was bogus.

t1_dt61558	1	*	I thought the FBI arent partisan 
t1_dt5xp2t	1	*	But Mueller and Comey appear to be above-board on this whole thing.  Mueller is tracking criminals and seems to care little for party lines.
t1_dt67hld	1	*	>Hurrr lets block all dissident information because our population is too retarded to think for itself  The home of the brave everybody. 
t1_dt5vz08	0	*	So when foreigners agree with you they're allowed to share their opinion on the U.S. When foreigners or U.S.citizens disagree with your opinion they're all evil foreigners?

t1_dt5yw0a	1	*	Oh I won't try to argue that the # wasn't picked up and carried by right wingers everywhere. It was, holy shit they frothed at the mouth, but still... do we ignore the continued influence?
t1_dt6cvka	0	*	There are a lot of firsts in this presidency!

t1_dt5vpxo	0	*	just because of the hashtag  yes certain accounts already flagged as trolls and bots are repeating an entirely 100% created myth used to distract from the investigation and discredit Muller.
t1_dt62xx7	0	*	Everything is a lie anyway is just one of the Russian propaganda tactics. It's meant to make people feel hopeless because nothing matters. It's a lie. Facts are facts, objective reality exists.

t1_dt5zth0	0	*	also the democrats are allowed to read the memo and see the supporting docs in a SCIF room, but none have. I wonder why?
t1_dt60yca	0	*	Anonymous sources doesn't mean the news source doesn't know who it is, it means that they're protecting the source. 
t1_dt6l7w1	1	*	The two are not mutually exclusive. As it is there is lots of evidence to suggest Russian bots are also pushing for it.
t1_dt6dqpo	1	*	> I find it absolutely crazy that people in the states must register their party affiliation   It varies from state to state.  Some require it to be able to vote in primaries.

t1_du76tt1	0	*	I'm don't understand crypto super well, but if eth switches to PoS would Tokens (ERC20) be switched too? Or would their creators have to migrate to PoS separately?
t1_dtmz3t7	0	*	Thats not how black market pot works actually. Not really buddy buddy with any of my dealers. Its a massive economy, mostly from Colorado.
t1_dt07z4q	0	*	Completely missing the point in order to ignore the problem?  Makes sense. 
t1_duxe1o4	0	*	Nah it wasn't that, I just would assume that weapons taken from citizenry wouldn't be so uniform
t1_dsxhma6	1	*	Because that's how our current society is structured. We can go back to aristocracy and monarchs if they want but they better not start winging when the peasants get out their guillotines. 
t1_dt0mog7	1	*	Are you gonna ignore the rest of the population that still forks over 30% of their income? Like college grads?

t1_dsudz73	0	*	Egalitarianism isn't a movement, it's a belief and one that a majority of feminists believe.
t1_dsuy0t4	1	*	Yeah, and how do you end up with good labor laws? Strong unions. Many of the labor laws that exist today came into being when there were strong unions. 
t1_dstn15b	1	*	Far from everyone use all the days. It's often not really possible to be off that much from work, and not everybody can afford it anyway.
t1_dstzkyu	0	*	5) Actually get hired at a real job, fuck you if you live in a depressed area.
t1_dt3skt3	1	*	The US won't do that. They obviously made a trade with Turkey - stop ISIS from getting supplies through the Turkish border and we'll let you sweep up the Kurds.

t1_dtx9l9q	1	*	The EU has had a tariff on Chinese solar panels due to dumping for some time now and haven't lost a WTO case on it. I'd say it's pretty safe to assume that China was/is actually dumping those panels.
t1_dtw9c4w	1	*	You are the one making a claim - why the fuck would *he* go ahead
t1_duwvvvf	1	*	Ah, I see the problem here - you're mistaking a comment thread on a news report for some kind of sterilized legal setting.  Or you're a pedant who desperately needs to keep the blinders on.

t1_dsb8eja	0	*	Less illegal aliens streaming in = less money spent on them.   Less illegal aliens in the US sending money back to Mexico/other central and South American countries.  It's pretty basic maths.

t1_duxz86b	0	*	Never said they did it for the *sake* of legalizing it. You might do well to actually read what I write before you reply in the future.
t1_dv22520	0	*	....I am right. Not even being arrogant. Go look at mueller's official page dude.
t1_dtc37y7	1	*	Listen. Canada can be stupid if they want, but keeping them in the western sphere of influence is way better than saying fuck em and let Russia have them.
t1_dtbk3eg	1	*	Ah right on. I've played it a lot but generally seem to lean more towards religious or cultural vic and never really a set plan. Naval power will be fun now at higher levels!

t1_dswp7if	0	*	It helps that Canada doesn't go around the world picking fights.   Also, for the most part, old style wars of conquest have become pointless. We're way too economically entangled in the West.
t1_dswr6yn	0	*	Huh interesting, I didn't know that, sorry I (obviously) don't know a lot about Canadian politics and the articke just threw me off with that
t1_dswk8hz	0	*	A kidney or bone doesn't have a functioning brain. At what point does killing a child become murder? The brain of a child doesn't magically activate when it exists the mother.
t1_dsyl57l	1	*	Our social welfare isn't that great on it's own that's my exact comment. I don't know what you want dude.. 
t1_dswpmzv	0	*	Neither of those have all of what it takes to be defined as an individual human. 
t1_dsx8yzg	0	*	CANADA. NOT STATES. Gun's aren't part of our constitution. And I don't see any anti-gun groups out protesting in canada because we actually have gun control that's pretty strict.
t1_dswv3bi	0	*	Actually, the rights referred to, excluding reproductive rights, are those listed in the Canadian Human Rights Act, Section 2, not the Charter. 
t1_dswpq0w	0	*	If they hate gay people...why should the rest of us let the bigots continue to waste oxygen?
t1_dsx4lg1	1	*	Bring it on. At least you can see your spiders. We have those little bastards the size of a quarter that turn your blood to jelly.
t1_dswmcn9	0	*	 Nah, if planned parenthood did not perform abortions Im sure there would be no arguing about funding, but they make an insane amount of money from abortions. Seems crazy to dump money on them.
t1_dswnz32	0	*	Quite a few child molestors in the religious sect. 
t1_dsy0882	1	*	Yeah, I also disliked Harpers policies, but god damn was that guy good at politics
t1_dswmgd3	0	*	I wish more people could separate their own personal politics from an assessment of the guy as a politician. He was very good at what he did. 
t1_dswqvsf	1	*	I couldn't tell you if the Supreme Court has ever answered that specific question.
t1_dsy4ykk	0	*	Please show me this criticize and bash.
t1_dswmoa9	1	*	> Not every hunk of biological material is equal to a sentient human.   Ok, where should we draw the line in terms of rights in your opinion and why?
t1_dswqk00	0	*	How exactly does it undermine that?  No citizen rights are being affected here.  It isn't a right to get funded by the government.  I notice you didn't address any of the other points.  
t1_dsxrubj	0	*	> makes it impossible for any discussion on the matter.  We don't need to discuss it. That's the whole fucking point. The law was made very clearly.
t1_dswb8vr	1	*	It's fine, a government can choose whether or not they want to fund programs they agree with, and if they make choices the public doesn't like they get voted out. Democracy at work.
t1_dswpm1f	1	*	They ruled against the restrictions that were in place at the time. They did not rule against any restrictions whatsoever.
t1_dswtz64	1	*	Lmao
t1_dswoomg	1	*	I'm a Canadian male and anecdotally,  everyone here LOVES Hilary. Male and female alike, from age 25 to 70 (the only age ranges I have anecdotal data for) 
t1_dswphai	1	*	The difference between them and you is merely time.
t1_dswn5js	0	*	Many are. They shame you and often lie about what happens in an abortion. 
t1_dsx2hwl	1	*	Next time they do, remind them they're in the minority.   https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/majority-continue-support-abortion-canada
t1_dsx3b2k	1	*	Isn't it not also about the beliefs of the organisation but what the money will be used for?
t1_dswp5xk	0	*	We're currently batting a thousand when it comes to war and no nation is really out to invade us so I think we're good for the most part 
t1_dsx0st2	1	*	You go ahead and explain how a Canadian democratically elected official enacting policies that his voters support is somehow different.
t1_dswl3y0	1	*	Agreed. This doesn't rectify the urest we're feeling from a botched voter-reform promise, but it sure helps to distract us from the major failings (half-goods) of Trudeau.
t1_dsx03an	1	*	It's working as intended.   1) Government does something  2) Someone challenges it  3) Challenge is successful   4) Government modifies law to make it compliant. 
t1_dsxbci4	0	*	Does the government fund speech groups anyway? I'm not aware of any U.S. programs like this one in Canada, though perhaps I'm just ignorant
t1_dsx0gep	1	*	That analogy works for women in life threating pregnancy situations, not a normal healthy pregnancy. The other guys point still stands.
t1_dswq4gv	1	*	She doesn't respect reproductive rights either so why should she be forced to say she does. It's crazy.
t1_dswpd1q	1	*	At what point do you consider it a baby? 
t1_dswoboz	1	*	You realise that people against abortion believe it to be murder right? Thats like saying if you don't like murder, you are free not to murder, but don't judge somebody else for murdering. 
t1_dswi6kb	0	*	ah, forgot about those things, those poor christians.
t1_dsxltph	1	*	That seems like a good definition to me. it gives it a decent time frame. 
t1_dsx6i3c	1	*	See, if I say something like that I get fucking hammered with down votes. I don't get it
t1_dsx8f82	0	*	No, it means no one can punish you for doing that thing. 
t1_dsxqq31	1	*	Was Santa and the Tooth Fairy there? For what possible reason would an atheist be against abortion? 
t1_dswybg1	1	*	Let me tell you the one thing I have against Moses. He took us forty years into the desert in order to bring us to the one place in the Middle East that has no oil!   
t1_dswr593	0	*	The big problem is that someone has to die for that decision 
t1_dswpkn8	1	*	Sorry bud but you don't know what you're talking about. There is a majority that is rational and believe in the woman's right to choose. Even in a deep Red state
t1_dswpbox	0	*	Then give it up for adoption. What did that child ever do to deserve the punishment of death?
t1_dswpneq	0	*	I agree, Im simply explaining my answer to your question.
t1_dsx6aj4	0	*	That doesn't really have anything to do with the argument at hand.
t1_dsww4uh	1	*	Oh, so you go by Mooches too?
t1_dswz3s4	0	*	You don't think it is harder to get more people to agree than less people? I cant even get my in-laws to agree to a restaurant. 
t1_dsx12ia	0	*	Pretty sure being pro choice and defending abortion rights is a party platform that they run on
t1_dswmcto	0	*	Are turtles people all of a sudden?
t1_dswsd9p	0	*	Instantly discounts the Catholics for starters... I'm not religious but religious discrimination is a very slippery slope Trudeau's hopped on.
t1_dswqrz6	1	*	I see this is just as tense of an issue north of the maple syrup line as it is down in the states.
t1_dsxcqps	0	*	NO it's not since they are not carrying a body they are carrying a foetus. Stop changing scientific facts to make it fit your agenda.
t1_dsx6m0t	0	*	> There is no such thing as a human right to kill another person.   You didn't say anything about babies, you said person.
t1_dswl79r	1	*	Given that only about a tenth of Christians are from the US, I think you may be overstating that trend a little.
t1_dswyvrj	0	*	Is every joke trying to be edgy now?
t1_dswpav7	1	*	Feelings aren't the same as facts. Please use some facts. 
t1_dsxobaz	0	*	There is a vocal minority into polygamy yet we don't tolerate their view.
t1_dsxbdp8	1	*	What about human rights for unborn children?
t1_dsxly3u	0	*	More than Ontario. As far as I know, they exist in multiple provinces.
t1_dswp1c8	0	*	Heh. If planned parenthood didnt want to get defunded for doing abortions they could quit them and concentrate on their other services. Why dont they?
t1_dsxqc2b	1	*	Exactly. I am very, very firmly pro choice. I also wouldnt want to choose an abortion for myself. These two things have nothing to do with each other. 
t1_dswqtjt	0	*	You came across as hostel and snarky to the man just because hes an American. You know nothing else about the person, why are you stereotyping ? 
t1_dtcunf2	1	*	And if it was that bad, then you didn't mean it.
t1_dtcqbi0	0	*	>  What doubt?  The doubt you are sowing with your whataboutism. It is blatantly obvious your posts are not with good intent. 
t1_dv0szan	1	*	/u/imlosingsleep did. Its literally right above you.
t1_ds18cxl	1	*	The law has been in place since 1871 and was redrafted in 1959, the only thing that is new, is that it will be also enforced online.
t1_ds21o2z	1	*	Funny? Hm. Sarcasm isn't always intended to be really... *funny*, per se. It expresses contempt and bitterness as much as anything else.
t1_ds1ca11	0	*	> I don't think some of the things you've listed (like death threats) are mere expressions of ideas. They go beyond that.  So does inciting violence against minorities?
t1_ds1p8b6	0	*	The Nazis created a badly written law to ensure that already existing laws could be used on the internet? 
t1_ds1brsc	1	*	If Germans don't denounce the holocaust for at least one hour every day, they grow a mustache and start yelling incoherently. 
t1_ds1cz7n	0	*	Theres no diaeresis in rxe9examiner, coopxe9rer, etc. That usage of the diaeresis is typically English. 
t1_ds6ip9v	1	*	Which decisions have been made so far that weren't agreed to by UK MEPs? 
t1_ds6i3t1	0	*	Except a lot of people didn't really understand the consequences of this huge decision. There is still time to go back. And that's the important part.
t1_ds6h8db	0	*	Sometimes you try and fail, if we could never speak out our ambitions, because we can not fail them anymore, the world will be a in a boring, uniform state. 
t1_dt2m1g9	0	*	You may be crazy.
t1_dt2bfad	1	*	So... Christopher Lee's album
t1_duyogi0	0	*	They are allied with the US. Seems a bit weird that you are allied with a country that acts the exact same way yet consider another country literally Hitler because of it. Stupid double standards.
t1_duyr31f	1	*	true, that is skewed significantly.

t1_dsmhfo1	1	*	Church was built 10 years ago so I doubt it
t1_dsmh9pu	1	*	It's also interesting that Americans are not taught about that time when America invaded China. [The boxer rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion).
t1_dsmzd74	1	*	People criticize Trump all the time without hating Americans, and Americans have a hell of a lot more say what their government does than China.
t1_dsnckwe	1	*	Just becuase they build them dosnt mean that they dont get taxed and fined  a crap ton. The gov will not stop them from building one simply becuase then they can start taxing them for the building. 
t1_dsm65wl	1	*	Exactly this, it's why Aussie's don't get taught about the American Civil War in school at all, it has literally no relevance to us. 
t1_dsr4cyp	1	*	I wish I could give you reddit gold for saying this.
t1_dsn2qqa	0	*	>Do you evidence of that? Or is it purely a prejudiced view being reinforced by clickbait titles?   How about everyday seeing and living under communist government? 
t1_durrwon	1	*	Its not enough to move where there is no war. They should not be treated like those in lybia, and should not be threatened as criminals.
t1_dusqr63	1	*	Yeah.  He'll be flagged as an important NPC and just take 0 damage from everything.  Always happens.  Unless you're escorting him somewhere, then he'll die from a stubbed toe.

t1_duvg019	1	*	This guy knows how to gobble!
t1_duula0l	1	*	Because I'm asking for sources? Seriously. Think about that. That's not remotely what mental gymnastics is.  See this is why we can't get along, I guess. 
t1_duufxt0	0	*	Then you're pretty naive. There isn't even a debate anymore that the Russian troll factories are a very effective form of cyber warfare.
t1_duuexsk	1	*	I can see the space needle from my house.  it's just not that exciting anymore.  smith tower is the real pro tip
t1_duuggkp	1	*	That's your proof? LOL
t1_duudrwb	0	*	All I was going for was to ask (in a general sense) who hasn't read the dossier by now, it wasn't intended to be directed towards you specifically.
t1_duugo03	0	*	Their speech is 100% correct. But native speakers dont speak that way. Everyone has colloquialisms and different ways of saying things. These comments sound like the same person wrote them.
t1_duuoo7m	1	*	So the emails were released, are you saying you think the DNC leaked it themselves? 
t1_duv6tpq	1	*	I dunno, I was raised to never put my personal data online so it felt weird. I mean my personal data was compromised in the equifax breach so I didn't even need to worry about facebook I guess.
t1_duugbvw	1	*	Also: bigger houses are harder to heat and maintain. Another reason why European houses stay up much longer than US ones.
t1_duugf7n	1	*	The fact it was upvoted 200+ times is seriously concerning. Brainless hivemind is real.
t1_duuikmo	0	*	You are not even trying anymore, Ivan. Btw I don't have anything against the average Russian citizen, just the government and the nasty trolls.
t1_duufvmj	0	*	Ok but which one is the Real IRA?
t1_duudx05	1	*	Also a lot of corruption in the US is legal - in the form of campaign donations. But you are probably correct.
t1_duuh1jl	1	*	That was my first thought too...I thought it'd be all cool looking flying in, and I could barely find it, and when I drove by, I was shocked just how small it is
t1_duuielk	1	*	I would say it was more about being anti hillary for geopolitica/energy reasons. 
t1_duuove2	1	*	And which country are you from?  
t1_ds85npq	0	*	I think you misread my comment...

t1_dt9hk5y	0	*	Someone order me a double latte
t1_dt9ics0	1	*	It's possible (and common) to have an opinion and be wrong. Fox News and Breitbart are not real news organizations. 
t1_dt9lzy7	1	*	Yep it's faith not facts that's how it works. It's a different way of seeing the world 
t1_dt9n7r9	1	*	You don't want to take this opportunity to do your own investigative journalism to expose the MSM's bias?
t1_dt9d5yk	0	*	Sure, its not gospel. But the report that Comey said was false was not corroborated by multiple *outlets* the way this story was. Thats the difference.

t1_dta14d7	1	*	I talked about their law school, based on what others say about it, and based on their actual admission policies, you defended the entire university. Calm down, get a grip, and move on.
t1_dt9etlm	1	*	Brilliant non-point. Carry on with your babbling.
t1_dt9brsq	1	*	Even some leadership for the Tea Party hated him (Rand Paul really dislikes Trump)
t1_dt9bfjd	0	*	ISIS was already effectively dead before election day, the SDF had been kicking their shit in wholesale for a long while.
t1_dt9xpg2	1	*	To be fair, the race was extremely close and the republican candidate was an actual pedophile.

t1_dt9pr5p	1	*	>when they really wanted Bernie.   Yeah they really wanted a senile independent rather than the person who's been a democratic basically her entire political career. Pls stop with the Bernie rimming 
t1_dt9sa02	1	*	nothing really.
t1_dt9e3bo	0	*	You underestimate partisanship.  Mueller could literally get a video tape of Trump sucking Putin's dick in exchange for Hillary emails and this congress STILL wouldn't remove him from office.
t1_ds2g3en	0	*	...dental plan...
t1_ds47s50	0	*	(S)Hes not wrong, both Koreas see the other Korea as their own. Long term goal is unification, whether it be through war or diplomacy. The question is which ideology would win.
t1_ds4yn9q	1	*	Anger?  No.  More like shock that someone would genuinely think world leaders would use an insecure platform like Skype to talk to one another about sensitive diplomatic issues.
t1_dupjjmv	0	*	And clearly you've never heard of General Vlasov.  Or National Bolshevism, Alexander Dugin, the Russian fascist party, etc. 
t1_duojzqn	0	*	If they fight corruption then why has the government leaders not step down yet?

t1_duodibd	0	*	You do realize the irony here, right? The subject was propaganda in Russia; now all the sudden we're talking about a U.S. policy that has kept Americans safe.
t1_dup6dvg	1	*	>Why does it have to be Putin or a US backed puppet?   Because after the fall of the USSR those are the only options they have had.

t1_dtpwax3	0	*	I mean maybe not *today* but original canning definitely had heating in the can in mind. The initial process for canning food involved cooking it *in the can* as part of the packaging process.

t1_dtqkqcd	1	*	In that sense I'd just say that the dose for harm is small.  
t1_dtq0dk7	1	*	I worked at a 7up plant, in Arkansas, stacking the sodas on pallets that goes out to the stores. It was not air conditioned.

t1_dtpwccb	1	*	But cans have to be heated during the canning process. 
t1_dtq2wvq	0	*	Sounds like a good way to avoid dirtying a pot and a bowl you'd otherwise have to clean up later. Smart.
t1_dtq8ao5	1	*	Fish have to be raised from little fish babies probably. Usually the results are seen when fish reach sexual maturity.

t1_du7c4t6	0	*	You don't know anything about me, but keep making assumptions and slurs, it just shows who you are and doesn't help your point.
t1_du6avz7	1	*	After spending $70k?   No way. He'll look for job in some other countries.   Annually, people earn less than 10% of what he spent.
t1_du6j7u1	1	*	Oh! Yeah that made me think for a second ^^

t1_duc9qbu	1	*	Palm oil is the base of the majority of foods in the majority of west african nations. There is no way palm oil is going away. 
t1_dsuut21	1	*	I pose you a question. Would you agree to having your taxes raised, with the funding going directly to help support children who may otherwise have not been born? 
t1_dv0dywc	1	*	That may be the most German thing ever said. 
t1_dv3vfdd	0	*	It is relevant if you automatically assume Muslims would oppose helping homeless women.

t1_dsoklyk	1	*	Brilliant post. I forgot to mention the exception to my statement that is evangelism or other stricter dogmatic branches. 
t1_dspb4g5	1	*	> You believe everything around you randomly popped into existence  And you believe a magical sky fairy randomly popped into existence, who then created everything.
t1_dspqc01	1	*	It's the lazy cop-out for people who can't be bothered to educate their children. To be fair, it's also a matter of how educated the society is in the first place.
t1_dspj59e	1	*	Yes, its a figure of speech.
t1_dsp400x	0	*	When you wrote, Considering God is not real, that's a pretty strong statement.  How do you know that to be true?
t1_dspbapi	0	*	Jesus was probably neutral good imo.  Paul is definitely a lawful cunt. Like the gospels,  quit when I hit Paul on my last reading of the bible. 
t1_dspy1uq	1	*	1 like = 1 help
t1_dsomd9i	1	*	What is there to respond to? The more you learn the more you would agree with me. Very substantial position there, buddy.
t1_dsp7ha0	0	*	You do realize that people can hold things in their heads for extended periods of time, to be spoken or written down later, right? It's this new thing called memory. Pretty sure the dinosaurs had it.
t1_dsonuje	1	*	Seconded. 
t1_dsptx2e	1	*	I love the church of Reddit. 
t1_dspijhg	1	*	The penultimate goal of a Hindu is the realization that Atman ( the human soul ) and Brahman ( GOD ) are one.  Chist isn't God, he said The Father and I are one.  That's fascinating.
t1_dsph40w	0	*	I use appeals to emotion when I'm light on logic too. Cheer up, those atheist meanies only make up like 1% of the population. Such persecution! muh 80% majority is under attack!

t1_ds299ng	0	*	We hate Trump because he's a stupid cunt, not because it's popular to hate him, lmao. I'm a New Yorker, this state has hated that mans guts for god knows how long now.
t1_dsisehh	0	*	Funnily enough, Farsi uses a different alphabet to English. And there are characters linked to certain phonemes and not others.

t1_dsj3rxt	0	*	Yeah numbered streets north/south and alphabetized street names in ascending syllables east/west are so hard to keep track of
t1_dsjh26d	1	*	Should they not rightfully be holding a grudge? If those agencies wanted they he could have been killed years ago.
t1_dsj4i3a	1	*	It's weird how the intelligence agencies treat foreign spies badly. 
t1_dsiqnwn	0	*	Indeed, but not really line of sight.  Cell signals travel differently than point to point microwave.

t1_dtq5hf3	1	*	Helen of Troy. 
t1_dst4gjx	0	*	Planned it before he even set foot on the boat is a big extra wft to the whole thing. I'd have thought he had murdered her in a fit of rage or some similar situation.

t1_dueijpz	0	*	Didnt Vice or someone do a video on it, it was pretty interesting. 
t1_duf18jr	1	*	Yeah, that is definitely a possibility if it happens. Propaganda is a terrible thing.
t1_dugc7ee	1	*	Meanwhile, Ga In was like stop trying to talk me into smoking weed. I'm not gonna smoke weed until it's legalized.

t1_duhglp0	1	*	The dunning Krueger is in full effect with these redditors 
t1_ds6asx2	1	*	Yeah, I agree with that. That being said, the petrodollar, although not sustainable in the long, long term, still has a lot of  time left on its clock.
t1_ds6pqbo	0	*	I will go ahead and say this. The petrodollar leading to US collapse is an outright lie. It has been debunked many times. 
t1_ds606qd	1	*	That's quite a far reach compared to what he's asking you to consider, in both the examples you gave.
t1_ds6i9fy	0	*	Headlines have always been headlines, you're supposed to read the article under it.
t1_ds6d628	1	*	I agree that the conspiracy probably has some truth to it. But the parent comment made the classic mistake of claiming much more than what is reasonable to believe. Which is what I had a problem with.

t1_dv0cut3	1	*	This is nonsense. The media LOVES mentioning ethnicities. Crimes committed by minorities are always massively overreported with usually implied racial identification of the criminal.
t1_dv144s7	1	*	Yeah but stuff like this you can just move to a new town or even a new country and it's all gone. You can't just get a new face and possibly eyes.
t1_ds4xnk0	0	*	What's unreasonable about requesting a settlement freeze to show that israel isn't actively sabotaging the negotiations?
t1_ds4awsf	1	*	they are doing horrible job at it then, as their population increased 3 times in the last twenty years.

t1_ds4gbbn	1	*	I suspect you're the one spouting revisionist history here, particularly as you don't even try to cite any sources for your claims.
t1_ds4a702	1	*	Its not the responsibility of Palestinians to provide land to Israelis because Israelis dont think that their country isnt big enough
t1_dtv5e9t	0	*	The EU is majority white but maybe you didn't know this?  Also I didn't know race had much part to play in economic security. Do you reckon this is why Africa is poor?
t1_duaf9mt	1	*	No its not. It's about school shootings.  Stop being so obtuse.
t1_ds4e8ar	1	*	Well, maybe, but I only have access to your present online persona, and it's not pleasant.

t1_dtfu58e	1	*	That is a fantastic compliment. I shall remember this to use in very special circumstances. And not just in the public toilets in Soho.
t1_dtgb2f3	1	*	It didn't stop the war, if that's what you're asking. But protests have led to change in the past, and it will again.

t1_durwibc	0	*	It's the right to self defense which is inherent, firearms are just the modern tool to do so with. There's no un-inventing them, guns are here to stay until they're replaced by the next big thing.
t1_dusd1ka	0	*	Well, to be fair the keep cheap firearms out of the hands of poor people is more about safety than anything else.
t1_dusj7xy	0	*	This right here is why we can't have compromise. Opinions like this.

t1_dudr317	1	*	We are talking about major, recent feature films. Most people *don't* read the comics or watch The CW. Its about the lack of black *main stream* heroes.
t1_dudpcy3	0	*	You're right about all those things, ESPECIALLY: party lines are thicker than common sense.  Yelling fuck the right is not helping weaken those party lines.  We need to get over that sentiment.

t1_dui1d1r	0	*	The implication is that it is somehow better that the Tories have doubled the debt over 7 years than Labour beginning it in 2. It's a ridiculous mischaracterisation of the facts.

t1_duiebeo	1	*	The South's economy was built on slave labor, the North's was industrial.
t1_dui0o0x	1	*	You can still have flexibility. If the employer thinks they can justify not forcing the worker to work their minimum hours, but paying them flat, that's on them. 
t1_duhz8go	1	*	You however can't use logical thinking to realize brexit has nothing to do with the OP. Sad!
t1_dui52vj	1	*	Unions are partly in decline due to immigration there's a reason Reagan gave amnesty and while until now illegal immigration was an acceptable part of the Republican platform.
t1_dui158u	1	*	I've heard that as well but flexible work exists without zero hour contracts. The key issue is that they are not flexible for the employee.
t1_duilhla	0	*	Doesnt Greece have the problem of low exports?
t1_dui73oh	0	*	Go where? To another job that also pays minimum wage? Not everyone can get a high paying engineering position, because it is only high paying due to not everyone being able to do it.
t1_dui1to0	0	*	Rural areas in the UK benefited from direct EU investment. Some of the (to be) worst hit areas in the UK by potential Brexit were big Leave votes. This was not a pragmatic vote for them.

t1_dttoqek	0	*	Not really, its probably because you dont know any feminists in real life.

t1_dttqnpz	0	*	Read the article you're citing. It says 25 people were killed during the protests a month ago. That has nothing to do with hijab or apostasy.

t1_dsppz17	1	*	Oh, but Allah said it was.

t1_dubxgc3	0	*	I'm responding to the thread collectively, since this is the sentiment I'm seeing. Do you see the point that just because there are no consequences doesn't make it within their right?

t1_dung2eb	0	*	I've never seen anyone drink with a straw outside of bar where they mostly serve it to girls with soda. People either use a glass, if they are at home, or drink directly from bottle/can.
t1_dunezvf	1	*	Like PLA. Plastic describes the molecular structure, and just like typical plastic comes from petroleum oil, PLA comes from vegetable oil. A lot of cheaper 3d prints use PLA.

t1_ds7uprf	0	*	But they won't stop producing from that other source, and we will now be impacting more locations, so overall negative for the planet

t1_dukq6kp	0	*	I agree that everything you say is true, I just find it very odd that a pinprick on the labia is a felony when multiple ear piercings are acceptable. Ick factor?
t1_duma61e	0	*	Your continued characterization of it as mutilation is misguided and invalidates the rest of your statement. Aside form which, you make no sense.

t1_duxivtd	1	*	Spot on
t1_duy7jdb	1	*	So if they are doing perfectly fine, why would they ban those guns?
t1_duypt3z	1	*	The far left would be socialists and communists. They support arming the population so they can seize the means of production via force if necessary.

t1_duyw8fj	0	*	What you meant to say is that no one in your immediate social circles gives a shit.  Big difference.
t1_duyck8u	0	*	The 2nd amendment doesn't give the right to bear arms though. It prevents the government from infringing on that natural right. Repealing the 2nd amendment wouldn't get rid of any rights. 
t1_duyhngl	1	*	So basically the title is a complete lie and they're not banning seminautomatics at all.   Good to know, I was getting nervous they had switched the proposals.

t1_dtkzd2d	0	*	You would have to be an idiot to think China cares that much about Myanmar. The entire notion is just ridiculous. 
t1_dtkws1m	1	*	Not really. Post war, many of the  German judges were ex nazi's. Many mid level Nazi's just got to walk away. Same for Japan. We didn't hang every officer who went ham on Asian prisoners.

t1_dszaz7k	0	*	They are telling you the rules of the sub.
t1_ds3dphk	1	*	That's not a good example at all. That just tells you if the policy is in effect. Not if the outcome is good or bad. Plus a lot of the impact of policy is long term.
t1_ds3e707	1	*	Fine. It's one thing if you agree with it, it's another to say that Trump doing it this way doesn't matter or change anything. 
t1_ds3bzp1	1	*	Well certainly not throwing tantrums on Twitter. Do adults really think that's a suitable way to carry out negotiations? Or is this thread just filled with whiny teenagers?
t1_ds3c16e	0	*	Um, ok. Why is it wrong to say that a public statement from Trump would have the impact of a public statement from Trump?
t1_dtvl6o1	1	*	The value of a life like the driver is, I have to say, nil.

t1_dsxfkxq	1	*	Yes they rather should die in wildlife then suffering and dying in too small tanks for human pleasure. No being should suffer for research.
t1_dsx895v	1	*	Yeah but there is a bit of an intellectual gap between very smart and as intelligent as humans. 
t1_dsxfg4x	1	*	Absolutely. However, whereas Reddit strokes their 2 inch shafts, activists stroke their fake imaginations!
t1_dsyb8c8	1	*	That was my point, yes
t1_dsx7f7j	1	*	Unfortunately there's no money to be made that way and a lot of zoos and wildlife parks need revenue to do what they do.

t1_dt3qe5n	1	*	They aren't versed in foreign law and commonly break it when they first enter the country and again afterwards claiming want of knowledge
t1_dt3l77u	1	*	Does that mean that refugee-sharing agreements like the ones Germany forces on Poland and Hungary are illegal?
t1_dt3qkze	0	*	I think that BDS aims to boycott companies based in occupied territories like the West Bank. Not sure if it extends to Israel as an entire country.
t1_dt36vif	1	*	Since scientific polls generally poll between 1000 and 5000 people I guess this is a poll on their website.

t1_dt3ui7b	1	*	Well no. It's INCREDIBLY controversial and divisive in Australia.

t1_dt3hees	1	*	Did u read that? Seems like ur beef is with the ancient Romans
t1_dt3axks	1	*	Because if those people stay in Sudan, they will die. They belong in Israel because itself will save their lives. 
t1_dugaxmh	1	*	I hope so. But I seem to feel the White House isn't on it. 
t1_ds7fq6w	0	*	Yes, I see but there really are very few examples where metal doesnt equal plastic in durability and other features in use. Plastic is much more just a profitable manufacturing choice. 
t1_dttguqr	1	*	Dr Tatianas sex advice to all creation is also a great book on the evolutionary biology of sex if thats a topic youre interested in :)
t1_dsmbb5w	1	*	Smaller Eastern Europe gangs. Mafia can use their time/resources to make much, much more money that what you make from relatively petty crime. 
t1_ds9lmr2	1	*	UBI is not socialism.  Call me back when Zucc starts giving control of factories to the workers and workers alone.
t1_ds6flrp	0	*	I agree to your analysis.  Although i think that the display of sex cant be even remotely as damaging (if it even is) for a child as the display of brutal murder.
t1_ds6mbpe	1	*	Because facebook constantly censors non leftist political views and pushes strictly leftist news. It's pretty easy to see why they would think that.

t1_ds6iwr0	1	*	I never said that was what Trump is using the account for, just that it could be used in that fashion
t1_ds6dukq	1	*	Well to be fair if social media was a government ran entity, then Im sure those would still be banned

t1_ds6ndty	1	*	Alright, that's good but what do you think about everything else I said?
t1_ds6q7uk	1	*	Do you think it might be the fact that pro-Trump groups might be more likely to violate Facebook's ToS in other ways?
t1_ds6jcl8	1	*	Lol. Never mind the thousands of non war criminal accounts that are getting banned... lets only focus on THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLES POSSIBLE. EVERYTHING I DONT AGREE WITH IS HITLER. 
t1_ds6i46r	1	*	thank you
t1_ds6fbdp	1	*	Private sector, but a public company. They didn't say private sector, they said company. Which it isn't.
t1_ds762ye	0	*	No, not following at all I'm afraid.   You are trying to dictate to Facebook what you think they should be. Their site their rules. Go start your own conservative Facebook.

t1_ds6ovkw	0	*	So you're against social security? Because that's socialism as well.

t1_ds6jd6n	0	*	Yes because its still a capitalist business.  
t1_ds6jp0e	1	*	Yes
t1_ds6i0zx	1	*	 Not in itself, but the way it is being used at the moment is dystopian
t1_ds6ve3p	0	*	Thats not the point at all, the thread was about verizon as a gatekeeper versus facebook.   Verizon as an isp is in a position to be a worse gatekeeper than any service
t1_dshht44	0	*	Sometimes you gotta give up that keg of beer so Lisa can get braces.

t1_dsi5dud	1	*	Hahaha yeah!
t1_dsho794	1	*	Either way cutting paid breaks is pretty damn low. I understand the backlash. I mean they got rid of the one menu item i like so doesnt really bother me.
t1_dshpdcl	1	*	Of course it does.

t1_dshpvin	1	*	yep.
t1_dsjw5sz	0	*	that was a joke, but they are not the majority of servers.
t1_dsiu375	1	*	At-will doesn't mean that there's no such thing as wrongful termination. It's still illegal for an employer to retaliate by firing.
t1_dshsc50	1	*	In a Panterra, at that. 
t1_dshsova	1	*	Unions might not be the best route to achieve this though. As an example, most unions in the US are incredibly corrupt.
t1_dshda9e	1	*	He's the cause of the Maple Leaf Curse.
t1_dshuxng	0	*	No, they can fire the employee for no reason. Not for an invalid reason,such as accepting gratuity. If they tell you why you were fired, then there may be a tort.
t1_dsi48wg	1	*	Hows that boot taste?
t1_dshdjra	0	*	Are any of those new? I'm not am expert but I'd bet they're all government or VERY old, from a time when union wasn't a dirty word. 
t1_duabkf6	1	*	Seriously. Thats embarrassing. But then again, Israeli soldiers only have practice with attacking women and children and civilian men under occupation.
t1_dua4nz1	1	*	Yeah, because women are so weak and useless that they could never do something like going on a stabbing spree or detonate a bomb hidden on their persons. That's never happened before ever /s
t1_dtv1fss	1	*	Well, most stuff you can just get from someone else...
t1_dtwjzms	1	*	Again, eventually, the entire world will tire of self-entitled americans and tell them to piss off
t1_dtvdzy6	1	*	The London mayor also said Donald Trump is not welcome to come to London, yet officially he is, these are statements by individuals. 
t1_dtveglu	0	*	Yes some people do, and yet the US elected a president that openly says climate change is a Chinese lie, so perhaps not enough people do hmm.....
t1_dtula8y	1	*	2nd largest on total and importing :-)
t1_dtvexj0	0	*	Look at per capita emissions, compare it to both Europe and China and their respective development, and try to justify the current insane amount of emissions of the US.
t1_dtw2puw	1	*	This is the main problem with American Politics.  You take sides and miss actually talking about the real issues.  Well trained sheep. 
t1_dtvwyz1	0	*	It's not a redistribution of wealth.  It's reparations.

t1_dtvjz53	0	*	The entire EU is barely ahead of the US (half a trillion) but also has a much higher population so I'd definitely put the win in the US column.

t1_dtv50zy	1	*	Right?  We can pour cash into them for weapons and oppressing their populations but god-for-fucking-bid we spend money in the hopes of creating a better future.
t1_dtv41no	0	*	Obviously other countries were expecting the US to sign and abide by the payment obligations if they're angry that the US didn't sign but may very well still meet the emissions part anyway.
t1_dtway5i	0	*	As compared to the US? Do use a favour mate, find a wall and start banging your head whilst repeating I will not believe faux entertainment.
t1_dtvwzqe	0	*	As was GB once, Rome once.
t1_dtv8274	0	*	Adding to the other guy the UK is still in the EU
t1_dtwwyuz	0	*	 All I can say is I pity you.
t1_dtv9yc7	1	*	Haha, stupid Europe didn't benefit from decades from slavery, burning fossil fuels and starting wars in third world countries for oil!
t1_dtnpf84	0	*	We should make the UK into a federal system.
t1_dsrlp32	1	*	The difference is that overall bad conditions push people to the extremes.  It's thus even more shocking when it happens in places were people have no reason to go to those lengths.
t1_dsrlsp9	0	*	What does being white and republican have to do with it? Its an awful thing to do no matter where your ideals fall.
t1_dsrufiy	0	*	All of them appeared to be children. I'm going to go ahead and include the adults as they were so tortured and neglected they appeared to be children. 
t1_dts72h7	0	*	Those chromebooks are suprisingly locked down compared to the Microsoft devices usually used. 
t1_dsxg8es	0	*	Near 0 because Nunes is a Trump lapdog and Gaetz has been trying to get Mueller fired for months. But literal white nationalist Trump fan Steve King is saying it too soooo hmmmm
t1_dsxbueq	1	*	Theres some memo or report like this every month that is going to rattle the foundation of whatever party is responsible, and it never happens. Im getting impatient.
t1_dsv9t69	0	*	Quite the opposite, Syria and Russia have not used chemical weapons since. I'd say a success.
t1_dsrm58e	0	*	We're talking about flying close to someone's air space and not in it. I not said that we should fly over Russian air space 
t1_dsv1u6n	1	*	No lol, I have ADSL and it's the worst thing ever.

t1_dtr7etv	0	*	> And yet you did it anyway.  Please point to where I did? All I did was assert that you underestimate the effects of the events of 1953 and that there's no point in playing historical what if.

t1_dtq5ay7	1	*	Oh well that's awful!
t1_dtq57i7	1	*	Ah, thank you for this info! 
t1_dtrjc3z	1	*	>And yet you did it anyway.  That was a different person.
t1_dukl25v	0	*	So your pointing out that the U.S. was/is equally as bad in Afghanistan. Okay? Doesn't make this right. 
t1_dugn0ae	1	*	That's pretty insulting for poor 3rd world countries. We should create another category just for rich yet not even trying countries. Haiti didn't deserve to be put in the same category as the USA.
t1_dufnqlj	0	*	If That was really a problem you could have voted in the primaries. 
t1_dt3x1iy	0	*	So you want a currency that consists of both oviparous animals AND mammals? You're a fucken lunatic. No wallet can cater for both.
t1_dt37om7	0	*	And yet unregulasted capitalism is killing the entire ecosystem humans rely on to survive.  If this were about keeping score, then you're barking up the wrong tree 
t1_due4f8a	0	*	Because you're dealing with third world countries with corrupt governments that are not even capable of enforcing laws or regulations. 
t1_duckhz1	0	*	Sorry, humorless people that get offended by obvious jokes annoy me. 
t1_dunslwq	0	*	excellent, that'll help in states that haven't legislated it yet. but the major reforms we need *do* need congressional approval, has Congress upped the ATFs budget recently btw 
t1_dune3au	1	*	Well, there is no point in arguing with stupid, so bye...
t1_duddt5x	0	*	downvoted for thanking someone for reminding me of the article I thought I read, and for them providing me more info.  strange people. 
t1_dtfxezi	0	*	Let in the amount of immigrants you want legally, and the rest keep from coming in and if they do expel them. 
t1_dtfmwej	1	*	Not really a counter argument.
t1_du4p3d6	1	*	So subtle that if you hadn't pointed it out I would have missed it.
t1_dsbxxo8	1	*	In a full-scale but somehow conventional war with Russia, my uneducated guess would be that we would be bombing them mostly with all of the things that we can. 
t1_dsbs4s4	1	*	No. We not do this. Look away.
t1_dsbql3c	0	*	Fair point. I'm out on the piss and replied to another comment rather than read the article.
t1_dscb2ms	1	*	So much of today's bullshit can be traced directly back to Regan.
t1_dsbtnjm	1	*	You don't even have to say 'would be'. Need only look so far as the Soviet-Afghan war to see the Russians struggle with Kalashnikov guerrillas just as much as any other modern power.
t1_dscftdc	1	*	Judging by the efforts of the Americans, Afghanistan is a tough nut to crack.
t1_dsd22os	0	*	The ability to nap on command is also useful. 
t1_dsbsvwp	1	*	Thats a bingo!
t1_dsc2haj	0	*	There's a bit of difference between those two situations.

t1_dsd3s33	0	*	> offended  Hahahahaha thats the most sheltered rich white girl thing i read today.
t1_dsbwnxw	1	*	The war was well underway by the time Germany invaded CCCP
t1_dsbuoim	1	*	Yes..I am a kremlin bot because i suppport my country..americans support their country because of patriotism..
t1_dsbw46m	0	*	Everything changed with the advent of the atomic bomb. It wouldn't just be a world war, but a nuclear war as well.
t1_dsbxstu	1	*	Russia has rather substantial infrastructure, though old much of it might be in operating condition. A war against it would be extremely tough and long
t1_dsbpv3s	1	*	Russia is by default stupid in lots of people's minds.   Big mistake
t1_dsbxtan	1	*	Agreed, thats why I found it disconcerting. I kinda hope I dont come across as paranoid to the real folks here without an agenda.  Kinda.
t1_dsbu2ov	1	*	So...you mean to tell me..bullets don't fly..without supply? 
t1_dsc58fh	1	*	I will take that as a no then...
t1_dsbyp7v	1	*	I doesn't know what you talks about. 
t1_dsc3lxv	0	*	Not what I've said at all, I don't think you understand my point
t1_dsbu2te	1	*	i'd like to make a toast to the troops. all the troops. on both sides. 
t1_dsc286g	1	*	Look up the new look program; its a russian program started after 08 i believe that revamped their military and put more emphasis on propaganda.  
t1_dsbwubx	1	*	USA USA USA
t1_dsc3vck	0	*	You could in a certain sense, but Russians have had it worse than Americans in many respects. (Although, that may change under this new regime.)
t1_dsbzks3	0	*	you don't press the button until everyone's in place...
t1_dsc15q1	1	*	Or people are just plain tired of hysterics. Every thread about Russia has a significant number of people thinking the sky is falling.
t1_dsbntez	1	*	Yeah, this redditor is either the unsung hero of Russia/China or the single reason why our military budget is so big
t1_dsbwahq	1	*	Plus its a great way for the economy back home to look busy, manufacturing jobs are needed to support the logiatical nightmare an oversea war is
t1_dsbymuf	1	*	Didn't you know? They're all lithium powered with solar panels in the upper plating so they're effectively infinite range  Edit: Jesus, you really can't forget the /s around here can you
t1_dsbqpdl	0	*	Sure, but I think if you're in your 60s and have hundreds of billions of dollars you can at least ensure that you're set for the rest of *your* life.
t1_dsc5f94	0	*	China will do whats best for China.  In this case, that'd be sitting back and watching their only two competitors beat the hell out of each other while they point and laugh.
t1_dsbtuit	1	*	Damn why do you guys hate the Ukraine?
t1_dsbr6jy	0	*	I really wish more people would recognize this
t1_dsbo791	0	*	Where did you get this 5 Trillion figure from? I'm pretty sure this includes not just the Iraq war, but also Afghanistan and domestic stimulus packages.
t1_dsbug7q	1	*	Bit of an exaggeration.
t1_dsbyfcj	1	*	Damn it, had a doubt when typing but it sounded nice too in my head ! Thanks for the correction :) 
t1_dscda9m	0	*	Lol...so you think Russia has no spies and it does nothing and Putin is just a great guy who does nothing illegal? Lol  You're kind of overplaying your hand here. 
t1_dsc7r2e	1	*	That means Tumblr is probably the deadliest general of all time since it can ship just about anything
t1_dsbvi44	1	*	And since NATO has four times the population and twenty times the wealth of Russia, guess who would win? 
t1_dsbvwv8	1	*	Do you really dare to deny fascist Pinochet was nothing but a US puppet? Woah next level.
t1_dscvphq	1	*	> Winter War with Finland.  That was definitely a USSR win  You forgot those yellow monkeys (as the Tsar put it) Japan in 195.
t1_dsbx745	1	*	Sounds a little too 1984
t1_dsc0pnr	0	*	yep, definitely not a cuban american living in the us, i'm definitely getting paid big ruples from Putin. Thats how I can afford such a dope haircut. 
t1_dsc6a62	0	*	Did they bring missile parts and IT technicians too?
t1_dsbtx5d	0	*	However much I hate Russia, it doesn't seem to affect them.  Vast gold reserves and stuff like that are no joke, man
t1_dsby7qy	0	*	I think you need to check your translation app. 
t1_dsbtpbr	1	*	Ohoo, what fun! *Grins Nazily*
t1_dsbuond	1	*	Eh, recently we've had over 16 years of COIN operations that would suggest otherwise. The US Army was born as an insurgent force.   
t1_dsc8jl5	1	*	Not if NATO invaded during winter. 
t1_dsbxocd	1	*	There is the single road on the Russian side of the border. Also, it would make much more sense to do trade via sea and rail.
t1_duuum03	0	*	Hope it works out but it does sound trippy tbh but best of luckU0001f642
t1_dsncfdu	1	*	I'm so so oh oh oh ohrry, with lots of schmeeeeeere
t1_dsnfll9	0	*	So, you have nothing to add to the discussion, and you think someone who think hawking doesn't believe in CO2 is saying your opinion better than you?  Then why are you posting?
t1_dsmqaz6	0	*	It probably pales compared to redditors of course. And we know there are at least 5. 
t1_duzx5am	0	*	Kinda   
t1_dv05q0v	1	*	as a german, I'll note that all sounds like a progrom.  Why does everyone keep repeating mistakes?!
t1_duzyuda	1	*	What the fuck are you talking about?
t1_duzzobc	1	*	Its just reddit children or tumblr tweens. I really hope more people can think for themselves, but social media really grinds down on the whole biased brainwashing thing. 
t1_duzy00h	1	*	this stemmed from a conversation about Canadian policy
t1_dv03xb2	1	*	> Do... you have eyes? Have you not been reading anything out of this thread?      No.
t1_duzxt56	0	*	Yeah we got the sjw poster boy. I mean poster they... something something peoplekind..

t1_dv04z08	0	*	Well that was productive 
t1_dv0me1r	1	*	Wtf lol it was not any type of genocide
t1_dv0bfdy	0	*	All of them? This feels too generalized.

t1_duzzlna	0	*	I never thought I'd read that in my life
t1_dv019eq	0	*	Luckily laws and rules are interpreted by people slightly less autistic than your average redditor. 
t1_dv0ekm4	1	*	This might be one of those times where 'destitute' might look like a steal in the not-too-distant future.
t1_duzz79h	1	*	Hey man, easy on the rotschilds! They're good people.
t1_dv03y8a	0	*	Actually the farmers appear to have a hard time being allowed into other countries.
t1_duzzccm	0	*	well deserved catch up 
t1_dv1wadk	1	*	Yes, I just don't see tunnel visioning that and constantly grasping for more useful, nor do I find it evil of Russia to interfere as they did.
t1_duzyf76	1	*	Yeah fuck nuance! Let's just create a strawman instead!
t1_dv0ayr1	1	*	k... disagree entirely for reasons already given. 
t1_dv05u6e	0	*	**introduced by the settlers 
t1_duzzgpv	1	*	Well, that's also true. 
t1_dv030qz	1	*	Sure buddy.
t1_dv5a57r	1	*	*Nobody knew farming could be so complicated.
t1_dv01eha	0	*	It looks like farmland is owned in accordance with common private property laws. Is there something youre trying to bait out?
t1_dv029pz	1	*	Culture and behavioral traits (ie psychology) have evolutionary components so you can't disconnect race from them.
t1_duzzarl	1	*	What a fuckin dumbass.
t1_dv05a50	1	*	So you're saying deport 99% of the population of the United States? And deport most of the non-whites from Europe because they are there as remnant of European Imperialism.
t1_dv05n2c	1	*	> Fear   
t1_dv3f8a9	0	*	Are you fucking serious? You dont know any black people, obviously.

t1_dv0cgag	1	*	Generally speaking, if you're visiting somewhere as a *tourist*, it's pretty fucking stupid to get openly political and not expect problems.
t1_dv086rf	1	*	They shouldn't feel entitled. As I don't feel entitled to think the Germans owe me anything because the Nazis made my grandfather a cripple and emotional wreck, which again affected our whole family.
t1_duzxocd	0	*	Read my response above. Your ignorance on this topic is blatantly obvious. 
t1_dv2co18	1	*	this is even worse that this law, the west is now betraying all the values, we tried to impose. Political correctness now stands above all, even human lives. This went seriously too far
t1_dv0568b	0	*	US citizens cant visit Iran without govt/business sponsorship. I was planning a trip there when the ban started.
t1_dv06mr6	0	*	That is what I said, yes.
t1_dv0d291	1	*	Yall havent been paying attention then. The white South African farmers have the highest murder rate of any group.  Its basically already genocide down there. 
t1_dv0bx1k	0	*	And I'm glad you can speak for your flaming ass. 
t1_dv00w60	1	*	>If the EFF were actually in charge, i imagine it'd be a bigger deal globally.  This already happened in Zimbabwe/Rhodesia.  No one in the media cared then either.

t1_dv00b14	1	*	Ohhh got'em. Nice. 
t1_dv0ljj8	0	*	Bantus not being native to SA is a /pol/ meme and a quick way to determine someone is an idiot. 
t1_duzzv0n	0	*	Sure just silence another white this is literally racism yanno 
t1_dv09g2t	1	*	Your total figure of 10 million people is on the low end of the estimates I've seen. But yeah I agree with everything you said.
t1_dv1ixmz	1	*	6 years doesn't count dude. Plus you're talking about Italians here. They could barely get the trains to run on time in Rome at that time. I highly doubt they stripped Ethiopia's resources in 6 years.
t1_duzxqz4	0	*	I never said this at all.  My only point was that the people who make these terrible decisions aren't the only ones who have to live with them. So saying, let them starve isn't that simple. 
t1_dv05xef	1	*	Ah OK never seen it  Thanks
t1_duzz5vx	1	*	America
t1_duzz8a3	1	*	That unfortunately speaks of the nature of humanity, regardless of race, unchecked power seems to inevitably corrupt everyone out there. 
t1_dv1acz3	0	*	Of course. It's your car, they should give it back. There is no need to decide whether the victim is a good or bad person. They are entitled to their property regardless.
t1_dv0bi8x	1	*	He looks to have an Afrikaans username tho
t1_dv272wh	1	*	Oh Germany got theres, dont worry about that. Maybe not at the hands of the jews, but then they killed many more Slavs. A tremendous amount of civilian rape and torture occured after the war.
t1_dv01aub	0	*	Well for example [here](https://imgur.com/s1DFnYm) I got downvoted for saying that apartheid wasn't fair or democratic.

t1_dt721qv	1	*	i'm sure that happens, but that is a pretty minor issue. Also incidents like that seem to happen a lot less than in disputed water in SCS and between China and Japan
t1_dt7gi2j	1	*	Not really, not in the way they wanted. For hardcore Nazis Germany is being conquered by brown people.

t1_dus9yqm	1	*	I'm sure that's the dilemma those families face every day. Flee into uncertainty or stay in uncertainty.  If you stay you may die. But if you leave you may never come home.

t1_duwvi1n	1	*	Fair
t1_e12feg5	1	*	Totally.  Have you never lived there?  The hours people have to work are inhuman.  The work culture is really oppressive.

t1_dv0xse9	0	*	Thanks.  I'm still not going to read those, but I'll feel more confident repeating this now.
t1_dv0nuba	0	*	Try reading it again, a bit more slowly.
t1_dv109x9	1	*	What?
t1_dv41wac	0	*	The idea is to retire before you're old and broken
t1_dv1275i	0	*	Yes sure, but Western countries have this problem as well to some extent. What about the lack of ample annual and maternity leaves in America for example? 
t1_dv1gvb1	0	*	I think you don't understand the joke this post made.
t1_dv0nl19	0	*	I don't see how they are different than the U.S. in terms of Democracy. Also did you downvote me for asking a question?

t1_dv0fjn5	0	*	A government voted in/for/by the people
t1_dv0h9qg	1	*	It was all over reddit when it came out. Also, the distinction is often subjective and theoretical. Take off your tinfoil hat.
t1_dv0npsa	1	*	I understood that reference.
t1_dv0owln	0	*	The test is so intense that they actually ground planes for the duration of the test. That's how seriously the whole country takes these tests. Absolutely ridiculous.

t1_dv29wfn	1	*	35 seems to be the norm around here.
t1_dv1vj7t	1	*	Not surprising that the movie was actually a metaphor for this rat race.
t1_dv0b3r3	1	*	Corporations are people too dontcha know /s  ^^I ^^Hate ^^Citizens ^^United
t1_dv0m5xx	0	*	Why? Because we don't think the government should be allowed to interfere in two adults making a contract?   Why is it any of your business what those two agree on? 
t1_dv11ydd	0	*	Meanwhile in NA employers will literally guilt and shame you for actually taking vacation time off. Meanwhile the boss goes on like four vacations every year. 
t1_dv1ksvw	1	*	This is careful academic language but the meaning is exactly the same when you take into account that the initial question is actually a statement of fact. 
t1_dv19xwp	0	*	I assume something industrial, or industrial cleaning. Only places around here that work like that 
t1_dv0m117	0	*	that's interesting, how does this compare to say, the States?
t1_dtdga0n	0	*	Oh, the guy's math was so off that I misunderstood his statement and thought he was just talking about the theft.  $534m - $423m = >50m

t1_duqav0u	1	*	Aye.
t1_dupetzo	1	*	'Murica!
t1_dupexts	1	*	Looting!  A time honored tradition in every army across the planet.
t1_dupf3n8	1	*	Right?  It's hard as hell to fully put down an insurgency in their home country but foriegn soldiers fighting the US in a regular engagement is basically assisted suicide by US military.
t1_dupg5zs	1	*	that's geopolitics in a nutshell, actually
t1_dt58nwq	1	*	*I'm* the real Pueblo!
t1_dtxlq3b	1	*	I'm going with Andrew Fucking Jackson for that title so far. 
t1_dtxt12j	0	*	Thats a straw man right there. I was talking about media. Not the general populace as a whole. 
t1_duwduuw	0	*	TIL posting actual facts is belittling child rape... 
t1_du4tjv6	0	*	Where does it say that? Mining isn't hijacking computers.
t1_du4m0ut	0	*	>there's literally nothing that can be done about it without regulation  Caveat emptor. People can be trained to be better informed. Fraud remains illegal too.
t1_dsgny2c	0	*	Just because they're closer to one party than the other does not make them synonymous.  You're closer to a Chimpanzee than you are a Mosquito.  But, that doesn't mean I can call you a Chimpanzee.
t1_dui64mt	0	*	Honestly, I don't blame you. I'm sure you realize there are great Americans too, but that fact is probably pretty easy to forget right now. 
t1_dul4ub1	1	*	Get a look at the Reddit expert on China from his mom's basement, lol.
t1_duimmn6	1	*	Probably just a consul or someone of the diplomatic staff doing their job and saying something along the lines Please be light with our citizens don't punish them extraordinarily.

t1_duhu7yx	1	*	It was my fiancee's party, but yeah she's in a lab that's sort of? related to that.  Usually they're just at her boss's house, so it was a nice change of pace.

t1_dsnm83t	1	*	I hate NSA spying, but if I'd hade to *pick* between them and Putin I'd pick NSA.
t1_dsnxeiy	1	*	So we should privatize it all? The way you are looking at it is already flawed and simplified - what's a solution that will create zero waste that makes sense for shared services of a community? 
t1_dso1vkn	1	*	Yet we continue to vote the wrong people into office.
t1_dsnphnw	1	*	easy, just only use computers a day later to let the AV catch up /s

t1_dscsfdt	1	*	Abkhazia, Ossetia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Ukraine, Chechnya. These are conflicts inside of the ex-USSR. 
t1_dtacvll	0	*	You are saying that all government organisation owned newspapers are not reliable?
t1_dshm09c	0	*	> So why should we apply western ideals on those people.  Because these are the rules we've setup for our society. We don't throw out people we disagree with.
t1_dt3ps0u	0	*	thats not how it works, so u want to tax polluters right, would u be happy if america started by putting a large tax on meat? ye thought so
t1_dt3qh1j	1	*	The issue for American companies and workers is that the states would lose those jobs,  income,  and national security of energy production. Same thing happened with chinese steel a few years ago
t1_dt44zp0	0	*	You realize there are literally hundreds of solar factories worldwide? Even the ones in the US were still competing against China fine.  The reality is, Trump's move is to protect coal, not solar.
t1_dt3fjz6	1	*	Not denying that but they are also leading the world in a lot of manufacturing high end equipment and vehicles.
t1_dv2o3v1	0	*	All of them.

t1_dtiypnf	1	*	I understood and agree with that. I just wanted to clarify that Portugal being massively religious is one of the biggest misconceptions about the country. I apologize if I didn't make myself clear. 
t1_dtinu1o	1	*	Evidence shows that decriminalizing reduces crime, overdoses, and drug use. 
t1_dsqv9qt	1	*	Like what happend in Germany after WW1 and England in the 60s and France in the 1810s and Spain in the 1700s.

t1_ds15czl	1	*	Right, it's like the nukes that were used to make them surrender was just fan fiction or something! 
t1_ds1bwwu	0	*	Its the Phillippines right?
t1_ds191v1	1	*	Especially the only guy who has a track record of shooting people.
t1_ds13w23	0	*	Huh? Dude, if nukes are tossed I think main man Putin himself will intervene and cook a nasty Korean BBQ. 
t1_ds18ko2	1	*	Happily 
t1_ds1cdvx	1	*	I've got verbal confirmation from a nothing source that we have weapons far beyond nuclear capability stored below China Lake in a DUMB.
t1_ds1c7f4	1	*	That's a mighty good point
t1_ds14apt	1	*	Kinda hard to imagine that, since the US and Canada have been pals for so long. And if they did I am sure they would apologize profusely.
t1_ds1ishb	1	*	Hard to say but Im leaning toward no. But hes also not the only one in charge of US foreign policy.
t1_ds161jl	1	*	Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun

t1_ds1a6uf	1	*	LA?  Absolutely.   San Francisco,  San Diego,  no. 
t1_ds14hus	1	*	Well...you are correct in one aspect Airman. You learned absolutley nothing. 
t1_ds13q8z	1	*	Thats true, those are gonna fuck is up probably maybe
t1_ds1hntv	0	*	Ah, I should clarify. I was using total land mass rather than total area. I suppose you could argue that total area would make more sense though.
t1_ds1cysn	1	*	If only it was really that exciting. Check out the giant robot duel.   https://youtu.be/Z-ouLX8Q9UM
t1_ds1659n	1	*	Oh how refreshing your comment is
t1_ds18xor	1	*	ICBMs with multiple warheads have multiple warheads. Not all ICMBs have that. Miniaturizing nuclear weapons to the point where that is possible is difficult. 
t1_ds1470k	1	*	Not much to lose.
t1_ds1668r	1	*	They're also stupid.
t1_ds1cxdn	1	*	Couldn't we bet, like, the Bible Belt on it?   I mean, economically, the ENTIRE Bible Belt HAS to almost equal LA, right? RIGHT!?
t1_ds1blv2	1	*	New yorker here. Come on, kim. Take your best shot at LA, you pussy.
t1_ds19zc5	0	*	It's how every country views their nukes. We don't wanna use these, but if push goes to shove it ain't just [insert country] that'll die. 
t1_ds1djuz	1	*	As far as I know, Australia is safe. So I also would bet LA on it.

t1_ds146j7	1	*	Well, to be fair the aegis BMD ships have shot down satellites.
t1_ds1601y	0	*	Meanwhile America wants to shaft us in every trade deal. Like Wtf mate claim to be our friends and the commies offer us better deals. 
t1_ds15t3j	1	*	That's exactly his point. He was being sarcastic, arguing with the person above him, are you even following this conversation?
t1_ds14s7h	1	*	Yes, I'm not American
t1_ds1k1ab	1	*	Tomorrow in TIFU.
t1_ds14eyo	1	*	hahahaha

t1_ds14cwj	1	*	They definitely could get it before it gets too far up into the atmosphere. 
t1_ds19st5	0	*	What good has Trump done? 
t1_ds1c7gi	1	*	That is an easy equation. Rest of the world is negative.
t1_ds150b7	0	*	It's nice to read such comments on here by between all the others. This fear mongering is insane and Americans seem to buy into it too easily. It's really sad to see. 
t1_ds150y9	1	*	The country most endangered by those is North Korea... 
t1_ds1a0dw	1	*	Thats no moon 
t1_dt8u1vv	0	*	I prefer Joxe3o Amoedo, but that's because of my liberal views. So it's up to you know if she is better or least worst than the others. 
t1_dt72juu	1	*	Temer fucks us like all the others but he's got a smaller dick.
t1_dt75lj0	0	*	She was one of Lula's minister, she was also member of Lula's political party. She's the same corrupt politician as Lula is, because she helped and worked for him.
t1_dsdwtn1	0	*	Then by that argument Europeans were not bad for colonizing most of the world, since no one is really indigenous except for Africa.
t1_dse87qg	0	*	Big news networks are subservient to the same powers that dictate our politics, that's true. But in all countries, US first, you will find some publications to give you an out from the madness.
t1_dsgm1ur	0	*	Well this only makes you xenophobic bigot because Google search results are personalized...
t1_dsep16w	0	*	Your comment about the UK implies you still don't understand the actual reason. 
t1_du1qrtv	1	*	China does allow criticism as long it is sensible, reasonable and that it doesn't cross the red line.
t1_du2k9uw	1	*	How is it possible that you think China can reach where they are if no criticism are made. Improvements can only be made after criticism are heard and acted upon.
t1_du2tgzs	0	*	Why is everyone shitting on India? They are behind but they are going to catch up eventually. Might take them 50 years longer but they are going to get going and will become a big player one day.
t1_du1flee	0	*	They are part of China and unfortunately will have to follow the rest of the country in how they're governed
t1_du24hgx	1	*	Wow youre ignorant of history 
t1_du2a0bq	1	*	The topic is political prisoners, not prisoners in general though
t1_du3684u	0	*	The fact that you brought up the Sino-Vietnamese war as a point after I already addressed it in my comment tells me this is just blind ignorance speaking at this point.
t1_du1jifa	0	*	Correct. Not many people would know this unless they've read just a little more deeply into it. 
t1_du1i6z0	0	*	>your blogs  NBC, USA Today, Bloomberg. Why won't google give me quality sources!

t1_dtt89qa	0	*	As a Maldivian, I think you're right. A large part of the population is still very intolerant. The only modern values we've accepted as a whole seem to be smartphones and facebook.
t1_dstdgwf	0	*	Interesting point. It really is one of those ultimate questions that we as a society or species will probably never have a true answer to.
t1_dsbihw0	1	*	It was reported literally minutes after I typed this, but you're right.. still shouldn't change the fact that a grenade to the face should kill instantly
t1_dsif5n3	1	*	its not hard to still get about a quarter of market value for so lets say they stole for 5 million worth of diamonds I could still easily sell that for 1 million.
t1_ds3f3bb	1	*	tf would i spent my time doing that.   they cited eritrea as well and it seems like people have been seeking asylum. 
t1_du0gt5g	0	*	Youre just not helping right now. You should probably reconsider your position. Its indefensible for a person to impersonate others for political purposes.
t1_dtomlcx	1	*	oh, i see... Hippocrates you son of a bitsh
t1_ds7xaox	0	*	>just keeping it real, buddy.   Rather, you're playing fast and loose with the facts in an attempt to justify atrocities committed against innocent civilians. It's really disgusting.
t1_ds80nlq	1	*	European countries didn't bomb the regime. They bombed ISIS when the refugee crisis was in full swing. And the rise of ISIS was one of the reasons for the refugee crisis. 
t1_duz280d	1	*	You posted a stupid comment trying to get inflamitory comments, sorry you didn't get the argument you wanted.
t1_dsti365	1	*	*Became* failed states when their currency collapsed. *That* is the point.
t1_dstxzbp	0	*	Smart, I'm gonna do that too and see how much hash rate my existing Rx 480 and my laptop gets me. How much hash rate does each if your computer /laptop give you? 
t1_dststzh	0	*	So major players in WWII. Got it.
t1_dsswyor	0	*	Probably because Mark Cuban has a massive amount of crypto
t1_dst2757	0	*	The debt bubbles will never go away. Most of the world's current assets and future growth are based on them. Just like in 2007 they will change the rules to fit the game.
t1_dst0emo	1	*	That is not how this works
t1_dsqshep	0	*	So you go from. They'll be fine to who cares in just a few moments....nice.  A lot of people care so that's why we do it.

t1_duym7xc	0	*	Becoming a black president... in a country full of angry white people.
t1_duyesno	1	*	The fact that the cat is out of the bag is not a blank check.  The fact that so many people are screaming for Trump to give the NSA more power is more than a little surprising.
t1_duyry3t	0	*	... the voters were angry that day my friend ...
t1_dtujb6v	1	*	That would be cool because i was an air defender. 
t1_dttmsak	1	*	Limited intervention
t1_dsdcrq0	0	*	Dude the US is becoming steadily irrelevant  The side of effects of recreational pot and reddit.
t1_dscugb1	0	*	Maybe I took it differently? The way I read it, it seemed like the comment implied the suggestion by NK that SK would do that is insane. My comment implied NK suggests crazy things all the time.
t1_dscczwh	0	*	The most pernicious part of North Korea's propaganda machine is that it is true.
t1_dscgjq3	0	*	Okay...let me know how that works out for you.  If I were in charge, Id pack up all my toys and let you ~~be their bitch~~ fend for yourself with that attitude.
t1_dsd01a3	1	*	I know, but US of today is the vestiges of the US back then. And back then it was a good idea to go all in with war industry, the world was literally asking for it
t1_dt98nkf	1	*	Those are not mistakes, those are deliberate decisions. 
t1_dt85wk9	0	*	No, but I also don't trust the US to do the right thing in the future. 
t1_dv3n8e3	1	*	But remember the time Hillary Clinton sent an email?!
t1_dv3u4b6	1	*	I am now officially soliciting Russian donation funds to keep the ball rolling.   If they come from 2 sources, maybe I can be brought up on some RICO charges. 
t1_dv308rj	0	*	Still irrelevant. If Russia bombs us, should we be okay with it because we bomb other countries? No, obviously not. We elect our government officials to defend us, and they are failing. 
t1_dv3onxj	1	*	Literal North Korean propaganda and Breitbart? No, I don't remember that at all. Remember HA Goodman, a totally real progressive, now the most obvious Trumper to anyone with two eyes.
t1_dv3vhu5	0	*	And an average lifespan a decade below the US plus a higher poverty rate. What a deal!
t1_duvqjyj	1	*	Both I would say. Any American is a potential target in theory.

t1_dtxrvjx	1	*	Ive found the opposite to be true, really
t1_dty57ur	1	*	Maybe I'm missing something, but I still don't see how this improves the safety of Law Enforcement interactions?

t1_dtxff79	0	*	it's nice here, you should visit.
t1_dtwnh5x	1	*	It will have its advantages.  You can't really stop this kind of technology unless you're willing to roll back modern society itself to an earlier point, and that's simply not going to happen.
t1_dv3xy12	1	*	What you don't know is there is a 7.  Some say it's the greatest of them all.  I'm talking about final fantasy 7.

t1_dud3zd1	0	*	The only way to ensure there will be no war is to be prepared for a war. Ask Ukraine, ask Georgia.

t1_dsqxks6	1	*	The distance from Miami to Seattle is less than the distance from Tehran to Paris. And the distance from Seattle to Hawaii is a heck of a lot greater than the distance from Paris to the UK. 
t1_dsrqwgv	1	*	Spain had 9% unemployment in an unsustainable bubble. The unemployment rate needs to go lower but its not that far off the natural rate for the country.

t1_ds4e03k	1	*	Its not the point, the US has geopolitical motives and all that fluff is just bullshit politics they throw around.. Of course we know its bullshit but it serves our agenda to spew it out.

t1_du5mbqx	0	*	Kinda like how Reddit allows you to prevent seeing subreddits you dont like all on the front page.  Dang dont you hate it when social media companies discourage getting alternate views seen?

t1_du5bip6	1	*	Good point!
t1_du5ffhn	1	*	My point is: there isn't a clear differentiator between the two. Laws without clear guidelines cause _a lot_ of problems.

t1_dt0a6as	1	*	Maybe I should've worded my first comment  better. Because I fully agree with you on actual state of religious freedom in Indonesia.

t1_dtcc42w	0	*	Publicly financed elections with set budgets granted by the Federal Government is the way to go.  Force them to use actual speech as speech.

t1_dsuqkss	1	*	Keep on waiting for that revolution, bro.  But better stock up on snacks.
t1_dt1jesi	1	*	> fascism  No.  > racism  There's a hint of truth to this, but it is way overstated.      Both sides do a horrible job of managing their crazies.

t1_dsnr5yu	1	*	What about him?
t1_dsnnr6b	0	*	Nazis rise to power can hardly be blamed on the mobs the Antifa Aktion created. The Nazi party had been fighting and causing riots years before they took power.

t1_duo6jxp	0	*	Oh geez even the soil can kill people.
t1_durj9kc	0	*	I agree. Our power grid can and should be sorted. But as a society we need to reduce our obsession with meat every meal. Cows are one of the biggest problems due to how many we produce.
t1_durmffv	1	*	I'd probably be sweatimg my ass off if I was riding a bike right now. Hell, I sweat in the winter time tho.

t1_dspp35h	1	*	It doesn't confuse me that it happens. It confuses me that it's used an excuse whenever someone acts like a dick.  Shitty behavior being common doesn't mean that shitty behavior is mandatory or good 
t1_dsprs47	1	*	No. Lithuanians. 
t1_dsplzdz	0	*	For someone to specify VERY VERY nsfl? I'd need an actual throat getting manually ripped out, high definition, daylight, no camera shaking.  Just regular nsfl is bad enough, how bad is extra nsfl?

t1_dt9f6qo	0	*	Not in Palestine no. Hard to imagine the refugee populations in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc wouldn't come back in a one-state solution though.

t1_dt9kisv	1	*	Right, and Israel knows that a little bit of terrorism is a small price to pay for Arab land, as long as the US is footing the security bill. 
t1_dt8uxhx	0	*	And ignorant people think that all Irish like the IRA, the truth is the vast majority of catholic Irish hate the IRA and the Unionists both equally. 
t1_dta2rk7	1	*	The biggest? Seriously? Is this the first time you have tried to follow a conversation?
t1_dt9776z	0	*	> Israel will never agree to that, it would mean giving up on the idea of a Jewish state.  Sometimes giving up on a *very bad* idea (like Zionism) is a very *good* idea.

t1_duej1g3	1	*	I'm sorry if my comment came across as a bit arsey, it's hard to get the tone across on the internet; my comment was meant as a bantering rejoinder rather than having a go at you

t1_dtgcuf3	0	*	Which is pretty loose use of the word couple which the guy was complaining about in the first place......

t1_dsa54ge	0	*	How does time negate the ethical and philosophical basis behind it?
t1_dsa3id3	0	*	What do you mean by recent hate speech laws? Hate speech doesn't exist as a separate concept in German law.
t1_ds9xs7f	1	*	Its a dilemma to be sure.
t1_dsag5kb	1	*	For most people the two are one and the same. Zionism is the rallying call of those that are pro-occupation and pro-settlement expansion, as far as I've seen.  
t1_dsahfyl	1	*	Do you have a source for that claim?   When I google Death for all Jews, I only find PewDiePie videos, but absolutely zero events in Germany.
t1_dsa847k	1	*	Then again, if you are Pro Palestine you are for a terrorist state that wants to kill all of the Jews. 
t1_dsachux	0	*	Hah. No. That's just an accident of history that they were first. The god of battle and blood, Yahweh, was a very successful god of conquering and genocide when he was first invented. 
t1_dsbts6b	0	*	Most religions take a dim view of denying their faith.
t1_dsaqeq7	0	*	Zionism is the belief that Jews have the right to create a religious state in a particular area of the Earth.  I'm against that notion.
t1_dsaat53	0	*	About as excellent as yours. Maybe if we were still living during the crusades what you said would make sense.
t1_dsa7j39	0	*	NetzDG is not 70 years old...
t1_dsakjfc	1	*	It's frustrating when people try to conflate hatred for the state of israel and their genocidal tactics and the jewish people which are not one and the same
t1_dsabh76	1	*	I don't mean legally. I mean as far as views go. It's not surprising that people are prejudiced against a group of people who have widespread prejudice and human rights issues.
t1_dsai5rs	1	*	Huh, you apparently don't happen to be a secular Jew... Trust me, there are more than enough Jewish proselytizers. 
t1_dugwgp2	0	*	Id rather have the 50/60 people die per year than the 14000 odd per year tho, wouldnt you agree?
t1_ds30srd	0	*	Sounds energy-intensive to me
t1_ds37tlc	0	*	> explain to me why banks are using bitcoin to transfer value if they are so efficient  Show me where they are actually doing that, first.
t1_ds30t6j	1	*	Banks would continue to exist no matter if the currency were seashells, dollars, or Bitcoin. Banks exist due to demand for credit not currency. 
t1_ds2y5bs	0	*	>Mining has never been and never will be about transaction throughput.  Which is my entire point...
t1_ds5zrps	0	*	Except caste system is a cultural thing and not a religious one.  This problem plagues bit just Hinduism, but other religions too in India.

t1_dtmz7i1	1	*	I wouldn't say hypocrites.  Its just that people fuck up.  It happens.  I'm positive that whatever it is that you believe in you have violated it at times.  I have.
t1_dtog8se	1	*	Keeping sun out, keeping sweat and moisture in and not let it evaporate. 
t1_dtnwek5	1	*	Dunno why you're getting downvoted.  Absolutely true.  They oppress people at home with their religion, while having orgies in London and Paris on vacation.
t1_dtmvvqp	1	*	> you will eventually grow up and think for yourself.  Oh to be so filled with hope.  Growing up is hard, homeostasis is easy.

t1_dtnw35m	0	*	Do you only look at one side of the story?  What about how the other girl said bigoted things to the hijabi?
t1_dtmvvqn	0	*	It is ludicrous to compare conservatives, a very mainstream political stand, to the fanatics of ISIS. 
t1_dtn179w	1	*	It's rare that I see a post that's so wrong.    
t1_dtmzd6q	0	*	Source strongly needed for your point that, in Western society, the majority of hijab wearers are *forced* to wear it. 
t1_dtn5ys0	1	*	I'm saying it's as bad as ISIS.   Nice straw man tho!
t1_dtmybn0	0	*	That's because it's usually done to babies who cannot choose for themselves.
t1_dtn0k5k	1	*	religion by itself is bad
t1_dtn5uy3	0	*	Look; you can make any excuses you want; a culture that makes females second-class citizens is WRONG, period. And I don't care what any religious storybook has to say about it.
t1_dtn024a	0	*	That analogy doesnt even make sense. I suggest you listen to women who choose to wear the hijab and their reasons before why before likening them to slaves. 
t1_dtmvq24	1	*	I know many ex Muslims and I agree. 
t1_dtntkn7	1	*	I worked with Acrassicauda several times. Great band and great dudes.
t1_dtmpdgu	1	*	I do live in Iran and as you can see I'm on Reddit a website relatively unknown in Iran. But there's shitloads of atheists on Telegram too.

t1_ds4em8x	1	*	*A slight sunburn doesn't sell ad space Mitch god dammit.*
t1_dttsr54	1	*	Getting a driving licence in France involves more mandatory training than in the US, so yes, especially young drivers are going to be more experienced or smarter (as you called it) in France.
t1_dtuhmp9	0	*	Common sense or general knowledge is disproven on a regular basis. Having some actual evidence is generally very helpful.

t1_ds1tr2s	0	*	welcome into the real world 
t1_du1bw94	0	*	Thats not True. Ypg is Shooting Rockets at turkish border towns. Those shootings started with the start of the operation though and wasnt the case before.
t1_du1pxg4	1	*	no you are the one arming them
t1_du1j2fp	1	*	More Turkish astroturfing nonsense. Theyre even emulating the Russians online.
t1_du1durv	1	*	No, it isn't.  The war has cost Turkey's economy, not grown it. Also, Turkey's growth rates have been high for a very long time, for decades even.

t1_dtqeexj	0	*	As an outsider, it seems like such a non issue, and perhaps even an intelligence operation designed to keep Macedonia out of NATO and enforce pan-slavinism... Er wonder who could support that? 
t1_dtqkfpf	1	*	Oh, for sure. It's still more plausible than some of the bonkers theories floaing around places like Texas, for example.
t1_dur71jz	0	*	Sure, but thats a long process requiring cultural makeover and political will .. both are available now. 
t1_dspueh6	1	*	Generally, I found the Welsh to be quite friendly and held favorable views of America. Overall, no major complaints.

t1_dspbm53	1	*	Psh. How can that possibly be true.
t1_dsoc20h	0	*	You are self deprecating about some things but uptight about most. 
t1_dsod7l8	1	*	Yes, yes it clearly does
t1_dsopiul	1	*	That's how we define our special relationship with you guys though. Frogs & Rosbifs. 
t1_duoilr0	0	*	And I can't go into a restaurant and kill 17 people by making them choke on their food. Fucking stupid comparison. 
t1_duoiza5	1	*	All good, no harm done, glad it was commented later or I would spent a lot of time on an unnecessary rant about the reliability of technology.
t1_duopjl6	1	*	Really dont need tighter gun control we need parents that raise kids correctly
t1_duodmnw	1	*	Defend yourself from what? How many times have you been attacked so far? You guys are scared little pussies, paranoid, and thinking everyone is out to get you. It's pathetic.
t1_dunsqfp	0	*	No, those who stuff it in others' faces in an attempt to take that which is not theirs is a potential murderer.
t1_dunzg2p	0	*	No, being fully automatic is exactly what makes it an assault rifle. Otherwise it is just a rifle. So what you're really suggesting is banning rifles.
t1_dunydw5	1	*	The Federal Government has no problem legislating their way around our protections against unreasonable searches in the name of public safety. 
t1_duq7pqt	0	*	It doesn't turn them into heroes. Like I said,  >If they want to conceal carry and take action then thats up to them  It gives them a fighting chance in the case the unthinkable happens.
t1_duqzxn5	0	*	Well, we USED to do that...and it worked great then.  The experts don't know much then if they don't know our history.

t1_duox39d	1	*	If you have a serial number, you can trace the point of sale, i.e the gun broker and who he sold to.
t1_dupq9mw	1	*	but it's not unheard of and people don't flip their shit when it happens.  i agree most security is garbage, but at least they get the chance to make a difference when employed.
t1_duo1fsw	0	*	Exactly! My point exactly.
t1_dunxk0q	1	*	But then people would have to take personal responsibility, so that's a no-go.
t1_dup9ti4	0	*	Actully I dont think the PM would have made that remark if it wasnt for Trump and the fact the he is so unpopular he can score some homepoints by doing this.

t1_dtil360	0	*	Trump is increasing the number of prisoners. If he was opposed to Gitmo he would preserve the status quo
t1_dtifvt0	1	*	\> Except German, Italian and Japanese soldiers were treated as POWs and protected under the Geneva convention.  lmao. The grunts on both sides of that war very rarely followed the Geneva convention.
t1_dtiekid	0	*	That's almost 4 fridges!
t1_dtj2cv9	1	*	The fact that you do not see the difference in context says a lot.  edit: lol seconds after posting you down voted me, stay classy.

t1_dtiyb6j	0	*	Be stronger, no one else is responsible for you but yourself. Weaker people have done it, so can you.
t1_dtix5cn	1	*	From the article it looks like the Bush administration actually cut it down from 700 to about 200. The rest was Obama.
t1_dtjcccl	1	*	Well your comment is at best misleading and at worst a complete lie but alright
t1_dtishjp	1	*	Representative democracy is mob rule? Even if that made any sense, how is being ruled by the minority mob better than being ruled by the majority mob?
t1_dtisvjj	1	*	That's like 2 and a half refrigerators on air Force one.

t1_dtk5ltq	1	*	that's what the people in charge of gitmo said, that they were processing and releasing all the innocent people.

t1_dtikrc2	0	*	He tried to close it. He didn't succede, obviously, but he tried
t1_dtin7zm	1	*	The wiki isn't updated past June 2017. a google search says this was all worked out. I imagine there will be some drama about any deals, no matter who they were, as thats just politics.
t1_dtihvji	1	*	Okay c'mon, he very clearly tried, it's not like the number of prisoners just magically went down over time on its own. Obviously there was some human intervention. 
t1_dtihtkg	0	*	Then I think 'everything is fake' being the chorus in Team America's opening musical number
t1_dtiz4hs	0	*	I wouldn't want someone to shoot me, but I'd shoot a terrorist to prevent murder. 
t1_dtjt5d7	0	*	Weigh in that republicans have large families while democrats abort their would be future voters
t1_dtirfou	1	*	On some subjects but they are in a lot of places other aren't.
t1_dtig665	1	*	That's your interpretation. I just stated their most prominent objections. 
t1_dtith0w	1	*	Some of their older documentaries (all of their North Korea ones) are phenomenal 
t1_dti3488	1	*	That's already been the case.
t1_dtjgq3d	0	*	It's a fact, Gitmo is not in the US and Americans are not held there.
t1_dtiguo9	1	*	Cuba did actually cash one of the checks. Castro just said it was a mistake.
t1_dtik0g2	1	*	Cops take note
t1_dtiksnr	0	*	Except Dems voted to keep it open too. You also have no grounds to hold them on American land due to where their sins were committed. So your statement about the dumb argument are not true at all.
t1_dtigpla	0	*	And yet the greatest country in the world still cant defeat the terrorists despite 2 decades of trying  American citizens are the laziest, fattest, most drug-addicted motherfuckers in the world.
t1_dtiqqg4	1	*	I just watched Zoolander 2 and just realized trump operates like Zoolander in that movie.
t1_dtigcuq	1	*	So close to a haiku.
t1_dtiiqur	1	*	Cmon man I gave you some lottery numbers. 
t1_dtintaz	0	*	I wanted to be mad at this, but it's true.   The local leaders have a looooot of power over there. They can get you locked up, or keep you out of trouble. 
t1_dtih95b	1	*	He stole it! Like from a bank?
t1_dtiwvol	1	*	Yeah and they think my gods are evil and fake. If they had their way they'd go back to the burning of heretics. 
t1_dtiivqg	1	*	Thanks... I haven't had my caffeine yet. 
t1_dtj86ey	0	*	I can live with people like you thinking I'm a bad human. Same as you probably don't care that I think the same about you
t1_dtih6z6	0	*	Yeah it totally didn't have anything to do with Abu Ghraib or the Sunni insurgency against the US in Iraq... nothing at all. 
t1_dtiq973	1	*	Explain this, please. 
t1_dtity99	1	*	>If you fucking beat this prick long enough, he'll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago fire, now that don't necessarily make it fucking so!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZrfcnU1FZg

t1_dtihlti	0	*	Sucks to be you then
t1_dt7yhlq	1	*	That'll be instant death sentence

t1_dth8puv	1	*	Yeah.  This is an Ivan troll if I ever saw it.  They're tactics ars becoming predictable.
t1_dslely9	1	*	Most phones have a browser,  do the work or be criticized.  Welcome to Reddit. 
t1_ds2nezo	1	*	I didnt say I had the solutons. Doesnt change the fact that human populations are unsustainable and the inevitable cosnsequence of not addressing this is ecological collapse.
t1_dssxkbr	1	*	Ah ok, I misunderstood the article. Thanks for clarification.
t1_dsslgah	0	*	Yeah but it's President Trump, so maybe they'll change the policy. 
t1_dv3rshx	0	*	Yes all trials are always fair. 
t1_dv3bugl	1	*	Littering, and refusing to sit on Group W bench.
t1_dv41m6f	0	*	Hes not a Muslim, though.
t1_dv395dn	0	*	He also had a note saying run people down with his car.  If the facility doesn't have bollards, if he has a beefy car it could kill a lot of people. 
t1_dv4cqhx	1	*	British prisons are in melt down. Prison doesn't work at all.  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38596034  
t1_dv3t424	1	*	It wasn't much of a question mate. The answers were in the article you didn't read.
t1_dv2rru7	1	*	> Anyone can get weapons.  this isn't the US m8
t1_dv3hzmg	1	*	Thats something that could very well be true but I cant comment on. 
t1_dv3ec5h	0	*	What did you misread in my comment that you're trying to argue with?
t1_dv3u2m6	0	*	I don't think the dead have any legal rights. You could probably put him in a carnival and have people pay to see him.  Which kinda makes me want to see this movie.
t1_ds2g8im	0	*	Devil's always in the details, eh?
t1_ds2ciwf	0	*	Not really. There's plenty of reliable information online for free. I swear, this sub has become aggressively capitalist.
t1_ds285fc	1	*	*potentially dangerous
t1_ds3c37u	0	*	Uh. It's in the regulation. Growing is only allowed indoors. 
t1_ds252k2	0	*	And you know the vaporization temperature of these pesticides? You know you're supposed to **wash** vegetables before eating them, right? 
t1_ds2b1g9	1	*	Exactly why he should hire me
t1_ds333h6	1	*	I was joking but it's cool you responded with your inbox being lit up like a Christmas tree.
t1_ds3pewa	1	*	Sadly weed is illegal in Norway, so who the fuck knows what's in it?
t1_ds2btra	0	*	It is a ToS kind of thing. I've heard of it in employment contracts mostly. Also, the legality of these contracts is contested in some US states.  Can any of the lawyer redditors explain more?
t1_ds2i4l5	1	*	Very gently
t1_ds3ierm	0	*	Agreed but Oregon boof packs are cutting my prices down to almost nothing.

t1_dtxh8gy	0	*	Stop beating around the bush .
t1_dtxmx6w	1	*	A corpse of a corpse? Of course! Of course!
t1_dtxbhw2	1	*	I'd be sad because they are dead. You're taking my comment to a different meaning than what is said. Nothing happened to me so I'm not a victim. 
t1_dtxh87v	1	*	You think it's over but it's just begun.
t1_dtxlek1	0	*	Sure did. 
t1_dswzqdt	1	*	What chemicals do they use to frack? Look that up. Where does it go? 
t1_dsy0y21	1	*	My point is that it would be very very difficult if not impossible to site this facility at a place in Canada that is not near a body of freshwater. 
t1_duiv1ru	1	*	[One of us](https://i.imgflip.com/24x8vk.jpg)
t1_ds2j4zz	1	*	Considering the state of the American economy and Trump's isolationist stance, that iron fist is looking increasingly rusty.
t1_ds2mjym	1	*	Americans collectively are very racist, so they don't really care about the US torturing and murdering brown-skinned people.
t1_ds23qvu	1	*	\>mow down our own citizens  \>our own citizens  \>citizens  noggin is joggin
t1_ds2kmm2	1	*	But that's like comparing hands that poked dirt with hands that went all in a pile of shit.
t1_ds3keur	0	*	instead of nitpicking, you could have countered the statement. You did not, so you agree.   The choice is three, btw
t1_dt9fe9s	0	*	In your opinion, does the country deserve any credit for anything they did in the past 20-30 years? If so, what?
t1_dsgb2gw	0	*	I mean, Israel HAS offered to return them in peace deals IIRC. They were turned down. So no one but Israel even really claims them.
t1_dsg857p	1	*	Wow... saying that people shouldn't be bombed means down-votes...  I think T_D may be leaking.
t1_du6yc84	1	*	I will provide sanctuary

t1_dshn6uv	1	*	> I get it. Islam is fucked. But, I'm not going to condemn a person just because they happen to be born in a certain part of the world.  Of course not, they could be Coptic instead.
t1_dua7ov4	0	*	Do you think we can trade our morons for their water?
t1_ds8fyvc	0	*	wow
t1_dsb7ftt	0	*	Of course but that doesn't mean there aren't differences  
t1_ds8n3iq	1	*	Yes.  Pugs are bred with the purpose of being cute.  At the cost of health and quality of life.  Its inhumane and should be illegal. 
t1_ds8gqwh	1	*	Absolutely wrong. Domestication of wolves began quite long ago and not by human breeding. 
t1_ds8gp77	0	*	http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38210837  
t1_ds8ghoc	0	*	Just FYI, there's a Boston Terrier meet up in Philadelphia (I see you like the Phillies and am assuming you live in the area). Cuteness overload.
t1_ds8krlq	1	*	Good for Wilford Brimley
t1_ds8iyw8	1	*	This makes sense.  In your case it's less about breeding for show and breeding for lifestyle that suits both your and the dog.
t1_ds8hpoo	0	*	Really? Dogs>humans everyday 
t1_ds9y02z	1	*	dem bitches
t1_ds8zvjj	1	*	Dude depends on the mutt! Mileage may vary, I'm sorry to hear about your dogs, I guess I got lucky. Jake has had a few fatty tumors but they're not cancerous thankfully.
t1_ds98gf2	1	*	Hermit crabs.
t1_ds8kx0o	1	*	I know I reported you 
t1_ds9nd26	1	*	Maybe go ask them about their views on health testing and screening.
t1_ds8eyry	1	*	And over time those genes will disappear altogether.
t1_ds8ec5e	1	*	I didn't read the first comment on the chain very well. Now, i agree with you.
t1_ds8cfu6	1	*	More that we shouldnt keep intentionally breeding this deformity into existence
t1_ds8mq0d	0	*	Thats not true. 
t1_ds8ozvm	1	*	This looks like the kind of cats people make fun of. Not that the cat did anything wrong, it just looks ridiculous. People are weird. It's like high fashion but with living creatures. 
t1_ds9nyeb	0	*	Gold, coming from one of those irresponsible owners. 
t1_ds8h976	0	*	> behold, an award winning cat  Thats an ugly cat
t1_ds8jmaj	1	*	Thank you for the response, that definitely makes sense 
t1_ds8f9oo	0	*	But still, we are digressing from the original article. Maybe some breeders do look after their dogs on a surface level; theyre still inbreeding dogs, though and causing health issues.
t1_ds8iv99	1	*	Yeah, um, it was a joke. 
t1_ds8n9md	1	*	If I offended you with my comments I do apologize. I tend to be overly blunt on the Internet. Also btw I do not own any dogs because I know I couldn't afford proper care! So I do agree somewhat 
t1_ds8ro52	1	*	You're right that humans have very flat faces for primates, but it doesn't obstruct our airways.  Just means our mandible is dainty and easy to break.
t1_ds8nmje	1	*	I get where you are coming from, but a lot of pugs and bulldogs cant give birth naturally. So kind of less natural than other breeds. 
t1_ds8hw80	1	*	I was merely conceptualizing my point.
t1_ds8je9b	1	*	That's a different species.
t1_ds8hflo	0	*	Yay! I can't wait till the whole of reality is pay to win.

t1_ds8egx9	0	*	Dingos and african dogs are natural and not wolves. I could be wrong but I dont think so.
t1_ds98266	0	*	Out of curiosity, do you breed dogs?
t1_ds8k0cu	0	*	This isn't accurate. Unnatural selection has been happening since the beginning of time. You're supposed to choose things that have positive results though and that hasn't been done with dogs. 
t1_ds8om8i	1	*	In a rural setting where I'm at probably 50% of dogs are some kind of working dog.  But city people you're 100% right.
t1_ds8l7yc	0	*	You don't really sound like you're in a position to have a dog if you don't acknowledge that it will eventually grow old and might need expensive medications or vet trips
t1_ds9ozni	1	*	I have an adopted Manx, reading up on his breed type, holy shit the health problems of a pure bread Manx!
t1_ds97cns	1	*	Luckily all the spaniel breeds are lovely, papillons and kooikers are great small spaniels that aren't in the same dire straights as cavs
t1_ds8kscm	0	*	It is absolutely the fucking truth. Purebreeds are at a much higher risk of health issues than mutts.
t1_ds8fuoz	1	*	I actually tell people this about my dog at the dog park. Everyone sees a different breed in her, and as far as I know, they could be right. 
t1_ds8n1vf	1	*	Wild turkeys and commercially bred turkeys are pretty different too though. Different breeds of the same species, selectively bred for maximum size in minimum time. 
t1_ds90sue	1	*	Then your in Flint, haha

t1_ds8voze	1	*	I do, but not everyone does, and I deeply resent people telling me what to like.
t1_ds8evt8	1	*	Ah, so because you don't think exactly alike and you are obviously morally right because you're you, they shouldn't do volunteer work at animal shelters?
t1_dsaj7k1	1	*	If I had more room I would have a pit to play with my Boston. Every pit bull Ive known was an awesome dog.

t1_dtszyhi	0	*	Yes, ten cents here, ten cents there, each for a 'great cause'.  On the other side of the world.  For what?  Posterity.  That's what.

t1_dutl7um	0	*	I am well aware of America's own crimes in this regard, we had it coming. But my post wasn't about that. MY post was about Russians doing it to us. It is not an opportunity for incessant whataboutism.
t1_dusxkxa	0	*	I agree with you, but that's not how the court ruled.  The goal should be to idiot-proof them, so this cannot happen. You do want everyone's intentions to be properly represented on their ballots.
t1_dusmz2g	1	*	True. Still, that suggests any vote-rigging ability is limited enough to justify more conspicuous active measures like the propaganda campaign we've been seeing.  
t1_dutqex9	1	*	Huh?
t1_duswcue	0	*	This would easily allow for paid votes. 
t1_dt0w5i7	0	*	You're joking (I hope) but I saw this idea being unironically thrown around by Trumpsters during the election.  In retrospect they might have been Russian trolls but still.

t1_dtj3m5n	1	*	Homeless people aren't Scientology's target demographic. (They don't have money.)
t1_dtiwyzb	1	*	Alright? So would that mean heavier taxes on investment income like equities and the like?
t1_dtjj68u	0	*	Great retort, bud. You really showed me.
t1_dtjpz8z	1	*	lol...you are crazy. leave me alone. 
t1_dtjhxyf	0	*	It's amusing that you went with that tired old chestnut since the truth makes what you think even less valid.
t1_dtj7k8l	0	*	Translation:  >I know more about mental illness than people who literally spend their lives studying mental illness.
t1_dtj6p02	1	*	There is. A few years ago, they moved to a swanky building right downtown. But as far as I know, they don't do any charitable work. 
t1_dtj2uuv	0	*	Hey if you found me sleeping and taking a piss in your shoes every morning I'd totally understand if you put spikes or something in them to stop me. Sounds 100% fair enough and you'd agree I'm sure.
t1_dtj2dru	1	*	All the seats have arm rests so you cant lie across multiple seats. Removing the arm rests wouldnt affect the functionality of the seat.
t1_dtjl0nh	1	*	Nah, just a marketing student
t1_dtj0o5v	1	*	I wish I could give you gold for this. 
t1_dtjch5g	1	*	Thats why you give them to house just as a starting point to get back on their feet and also help teach them to be able to get a job, take care of themselves, etc.  Teach a man to fish and all that
t1_dtk4svb	1	*	Looked it up. Yes, it's about 60k people in LA.  That being said, I've been all over the country and *by far* the most homeless people I saw were in LA county.
t1_dtiwjuf	1	*	Ok you are calling me out. You're also showing the world what an ass you are. 
t1_dtjjkz6	1	*	They are right wing here, though. The commenter had that much right.
t1_dtixxd4	1	*	To be fair, they're probably just thinking, I'd spend more than 0.1% of my savings to cure *my* dad's Alzheimers...  (Not that that's actually reasonable.)
t1_dtjkgmh	0	*	It's simply a harsh reality.
t1_dtj5wsz	1	*	Simple question. Where do your kids play? 
t1_dtjmh6v	1	*	I know, right? She so selfish, saving animals from a lifetime of abuse and neglect. What a bitch!

t1_dtj2bhw	0	*	there are different kinds of dicatorships, for example North Korea is far more nasty than china  and Singapore is just at a point where it doesn't really make that much of a difference in daily life

t1_dtj1ua3	1	*	I'm not sure which one of us is having a stroke
t1_dtiyrpg	0	*	We could do what we in Denmark call a: ''Tommy Kenter'' (Danish actor).   He fucked a cake... I'm brainstorming here!! 
t1_dtiwozq	0	*	You know, the old fashioned way, by shrinking our military and stopping all the god damned wars we are in. Then we will have billions extra to buy or build homes for the homeless.
t1_dtj0omv	0	*	Heck, kill both kids! If they are an inconvenience to a parent they deserve to die!
t1_dtiwx59	1	*	So when pigs fly and hell freezes over? K
t1_dtj3z8o	1	*	And if they are that cheap I might even buy a few extra to give to some homeless people around here. 
t1_dtja1z5	1	*	I thought the solution would be affordable housing and universal basic income. 
t1_dtl2669	1	*	spoon metal, lad, spoon metal.
t1_dtjiq5m	1	*	Not quite true. In some countries even the government funded part of the press reports on political scandals. That's normal here in the Netherlands at least.
t1_dtjfkru	0	*	Had to be. Like I said, the town was small enough you could gather everyone comfortably in the town square. And also we had a proper town square.
t1_dtj6eng	0	*	That's just awful. :(
t1_dtjal8y	1	*	Along with the other comment, durian tastes ok, but it smells like an old sock.
t1_dtj0d08	0	*	Everything in any city is going to have fecal matter on it, waste high or not. You have an immune system. Don't lick anything and you'll be fine.
t1_dtjlm5b	0	*	I work at a group home for at risk youth and deal with homeless populations all the time. Like I said you are a sociopath. 
t1_dtiso2b	1	*	They don't live like that because it's easy
t1_dtj3axk	0	*	I would hate for us to tie up more resources in petty lawsuits about homeless. Lets use that money to work together and solve this shit. 
t1_dtj145k	1	*	Also reasons we can't just take down the social safety nets and expect charities to pick it all up.   Charities can set conditions for people to receive help.
t1_dtixlj4	1	*	Yes but Trump was elected so we are obliged to talk about America First.
t1_dtj2oy0	0	*	This is the correct term

t1_dthda9x	1	*	oh jfc 
t1_dti0jkm	0	*	No, because she doesn't want to, and is not forced to in those countries.  I don't see how that contradicts what I said.
t1_dthdlvv	0	*	Okay, go ask her and tell us what she says.
t1_dssvo7m	1	*	Because the new was about regulating ALL crypto, not just Bitcoin.

t1_dss7s0a	1	*	Yep, money laundering is not cheap.
t1_dssp3sj	1	*	My hope is electricity companies will stop giving miners low rates. It is soooo bad for the environment to use electricity for this.

t1_dto6zv4	1	*	>  The memo is very clear about the facts that it presents  Clear as mud. 
t1_dto6cts	1	*	Trump demands absolute loyalty and offers nothing in return.  The loyalty pledge is just the first step of absolute control vs. the Jeff Sessions treatment.

t1_dtnx16r	0	*	Lol you wont get a reply from them. Too much logic
t1_dtobwcb	1	*	Asking a current Trump supporter to use logic...yeaaaaa...good luck with that.
t1_dto1zgv	0	*	All you really had to say was that Nunes was part of Trump's transition team. Again, that one is news to me...
t1_dto7azf	0	*	the Trump campaign had asked Iowa tea party activist Sam Clovis to line up some foreign policy advisers, and Page was on the list. 
t1_dtod6v2	1	*	Ha, I'm pretty sure it was Trump who didn't think he'd win. That's why he's obstructing justice. But there's no where for him to hide.
t1_dto26zd	1	*	It has been partially corroborated. It even says so in the memo.   Name two false things in the memo. I haven't even heard one thing known to be false

t1_dtyhdcz	1	*	The Clinton e-mails were not obtained from Wikileaks-neither were the Anthony Weiner e-mails.   You (and the people up voting you) are thinking of the Podesta e-mails. 
t1_dto5m0k	1	*	How come im a trump supporter?
t1_dto8b03	0	*	Are you okay? Do you need to lay down?

t1_dtpj5v7	0	*	From the FBI you credulous fool.
t1_dto84t2	1	*	Too far away
t1_dtotxws	1	*	He's most probably done both. He knows this road leads nowhere good and is likely doing all he can to minimise the consequences for himself. 
t1_dtnxyc4	1	*	Because Reddit. 
t1_dto1nwp	1	*	blermp
t1_dt1a3ye	0	*	And I don't think Republicans had all Republicans either.  The question is, why the holdouts?

t1_dt6ui79	1	*	I apologize, i didnt downvote you. I do agree with your points. Just pointing out it wouldnt be a sure victory. 
t1_dt6ndvs	1	*	I see it going differently, but of course I hope that you're right.
t1_du6nuzb	0	*	How would you feel if someone kept coming in the middle of the night and uprooting your olive trees, every night, and or burning your olive trees? Would you want them detained and punished?
t1_du6l7t6	0	*	Not really, hence the question. . .
t1_du72z2v	1	*	Funded maybe. Armed not so much.  It would show.
t1_du6k97t	1	*	Fun fact: Vonnegut was an American POW that survived the firebombing of Dresden. That part of the book is based on his own experience. 
t1_du6olt8	0	*	Current estimates range from 35 thousand to 135 thousand. It's unknown because Dresden was housing the East German refugees.
t1_du6kg7d	1	*	From what i'm understanding it is independent from the authorities (as in, the minister doesn't decide herself which films to finance, thankfully), but does receive it's funding from the government
t1_du6s33h	1	*	Its a government funded movie ffs.
t1_du6irm6	0	*	The Guardian and NYT pretty much exposed the RT and Sputnik reports of them being militants as being entirely sourced from the Syrian and Russian governments.
t1_du6y1un	1	*	Jesus Christ. I had heard of that practice, but no idea it was that bad. Makes it even more disgusting that basically every Isreal-apologist uses the Palestinians use human shields routine.

t1_du6vw6n	1	*	Plus, Vikings are sweet. 
t1_du7s2u8	0	*	Pretty much the same bullshit that America inflicts on the rest of the world when liberals are in control, they just don't try to appease the other side of the political spectrum.
t1_du6teqe	1	*	Well, Soros himself is a victim of anti-semitic attacks by Israel and the alt-right is supported by many right-wing jews.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/opinion/george-soros-israel-hungary.html  
t1_du74d2k	0	*	This post is *literally* insane. The antiboycott bill is complete and utter corruption and a gross violation of civil rights. 
t1_du6j3uz	1	*	Wasn't there also a movie made from the book?
t1_du6k39z	0	*	Full Palestinian control except the near total trade embargo in place by the IDF right?

t1_ds1hrp0	1	*	The horror!
t1_ds1epgq	0	*	I like that guy, but it's a bit dishonest to call out a single country. The slow creep of active censorship by governments is a global phenomenon.
t1_due77vc	0	*	And they're still the uber rich while millions of Americans live on the street,  so there is literally nothing for them to complain about.
t1_due3wzl	1	*	Because everyone is wrong for using tax breaks to attract businesses when they could be using the spending power of the masses.l  Tax fed corporate oligarchies are a threat to every level of society.
t1_duecdui	1	*	They said that the last two years as well. The rate hikes get priced into the markets 
t1_duea0sj	1	*	And buyers for that cryptocurrency
t1_duhnv2e	1	*	Private schools all my life. Best in the state and rated nationally. Only way to go. Same for my kids.

t1_ds1u4ox	1	*	If you're enlisted it helps if you have an excuse to avoid combat duty for stupid wars, but I guess that just makes you a shitty soldier.
t1_ds1rad0	1	*	Afghanistan is not Afghanistan's responsibility. You break it, you buy it. Afghanistan is American responsibility, since the Americans unilaterally decided to bring democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq. 
t1_ds1n4sl	0	*	No and that's not what I said. What I said was that Reddit wasn't nearly as vocal about it until Trump took office

t1_dtqwc9t	0	*	Well that's a stupid premise. But feel free to deport all refugees from Germany if you like. I think it would be good for them.
t1_du1j79f	0	*	I'd say the fighter jets are enough of a claim.
t1_du5iuai	1	*	Syria can arm whoever they please
t1_du1w5o4	1	*	Yea thats what they say. Everything that they bomb is Hezbollah don't look any closer citizen. 
t1_du1q2cu	0	*	Some of us only the know the cities because we played Medieval Total War man. Help us out here. 
t1_du1ck95	0	*	What does that even mean? Most countries in the world do not commit genocide, you are on the level of the Soviet Union, the Third Reich or South Africa
t1_du1auqx	1	*	More like your neighbor moves his fence deep into your property at gunpoint, and you shoot him in the legs and move it back. Then you offer it back if he chills the fuck out
t1_du10bpi	1	*	I think he's mixing up the wars in the Levant with the wars in Star Wars.
t1_du3uj3g	0	*	Thought the plane crashed in Golan and I thought he lived right besides it
t1_du1oc1x	1	*	Well, they certainly are trying to, but so far they only succeed in attacking civilians - which is a cowardly act.  
t1_du28dhr	1	*	Show me a moderate rebel group and I'll show you the war crimes they committed. 
t1_du18ysu	1	*	Actually they are.
t1_du3ib2k	1	*	You can even see the date in the blue
t1_du1nv24	1	*	That's not how war works...
t1_du1j93r	0	*	AKA, your ass.
t1_du1amnq	0	*	Iran doesn't have the ability to defend Syria, Syria is just giving them a doorway into Israel, Syria is under no threat of Israeli invasion if they don't attack Israel
t1_du1g8sf	1	*	Legitimate how? Guess the Italians also supported the legitimate German government in ww2.
t1_du12qo4	1	*	They do wear uniforms and do big funerals for them. Martyrdom, deaths due to military etc are highly publicised there. 
t1_du1b9n8	1	*	Didn't Israel have outdated tech and lesser numbers during the 1948 war? They were using outdated left behind British equipment
t1_du1nvjn	1	*	Lol Iran doesn't care about Pakistan, and that's rich coming from you guys. You pretty much ruined Afghanistan
t1_du1adh3	0	*	> you can't do much except not attack if you don't want to lose anything  ... or you could fly a 5th-gen fighter.

t1_dtpp3sh	1	*	I have it and forgot I set monthly payments but the 1 time it has helped me get through a pay wall makes it wroth it lol.
t1_dtrmdfp	1	*	Increasingly so, yes. 
t1_dtpsy65	1	*	100% true. She just sighed and said it must have been one of the pesky neighbor kids and would have a talk with them. 
t1_dtpu0ul	0	*	Have you tried not stealing?
t1_dtpsfvx	1	*	Possibly. Worked as sales rep and had the pastor sign a contract for cable with porn stuff included which is like 70% of the price of said cable contract
t1_dtqa5yy	1	*	That doesn't make it theft... You could argue it's a bad thing to do but it isn't stealing
t1_dtpvhi1	0	*	That was a bit confusing, the way you put it. ELI5? 
t1_dtps5xn	1	*	The pan-european party
t1_dtprszc	0	*	Does the 2 year plan have monthly payments?
t1_dtq8c61	1	*	It's not.  Backdoor Sluts 3 is the made-up name of a porno from South Park.
t1_dtptk3z	1	*	De facto
t1_dtpfkhb	0	*	You brought up stopping illegal activity. Who decides which illegal activity is stopped, and which activity is fined?
t1_dtpprpi	0	*	... by a man who have had his tongue and eyes removed as not to identify anything. That should work.
t1_dtr6pub	1	*	You cant use torrents with tunnel bear and they keep user logs. Free VPNs are never a good idea. Just get a paid VPN like TorGuard if youre serious about privacy.

t1_dsq5bfx	0	*	I think the media is the scum in this situation tbh.
t1_dsnsggk	0	*	saying negative things about muslims should be legal though.  It's called free speech.  What the asshole did to the girl though is **already** a hate crime.  We don't need extra laws.
t1_dsp3hbu	0	*	How about you defend your point?
t1_dsmxauf	0	*	It doesn't demonstrate that that's more likely than the alternative. I'm not saying it never happens.
t1_dso2343	1	*	Ya but the hijab is not a common thing. I didn't say there were no Muslims. Thanks for telling me what I already know. Like I said, accepting arab cultural practices has nothing to do with islam.
t1_dsng59q	0	*	Because wearing a headscarf is child abuse am I right?
t1_dsnul0w	1	*	What religious texts have you read exactly? Because they definitely talk about hate, murder, killing babies, etc.
t1_dsmxu46	0	*	> Your country is currently being ripped apart by people lying and spewing hatred and bigotry  Yeah if only progressives would chill out, everything would be better.

t1_duu9efi	0	*	Even with conventional warfare, unless we had a *very* legitimate reason to do so, the public outcry from every other nation on planet Earth would be astounding. 
t1_dut7mik	0	*	No, Russian sanctions. This admin is openly ignoring the russian sanctions despite Russia being a major supplier/partner of NK.
t1_dutr4ek	1	*	In original.sources they never, ever. Mention attacking america. Only defense.
t1_du3i1ln	0	*	Yes I know, my wording in the second sentence was poor. Im not saying its the cause. Im just hoping something so preventable isnt the reason those people lost their lives
t1_du399ls	1	*	Amen this is exactl why im also afraid if flying. Not being incredibly high in the air but for the reasons you stated alone
t1_du39rtj	0	*	I thought so too until someone backed up through an intersection at full speed.  I have avoided too many accidents with defensive driving but sometimes it is not possible.
t1_du376zu	1	*	Take a look at this accident...  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gol_Transportes_A%C3%A9reos_Flight_1907
t1_du3414k	1	*	The measurements are in deaths/injuries per mile

t1_du32ugl	1	*	This exact thing happened to me about a month ago except our back tires had touched the runway! It was also in Charlotte NC.
t1_du312mz	0	*	[You can thank me later](http://i.imgur.com/B7rTnIp.jpg). 
t1_du3csqb	1	*	It annoys me to no end when people remind me of this. Yes, there are other people on the road. But statistically my chances of surviving a car carash are far greater than surviving a plane crash. 
t1_du4fzad	1	*	If I personally was in control of the plane, then the stats would look a lot scarier. 
t1_du3p5jg	1	*	Not true. Plane crash survival rate is over 80%.  Source: Flight Attendant.
t1_du34a5h	0	*	The UK uses QFE generally for VFR circuits.   They use QNH for everything apart from approaches 
t1_du3dhxo	1	*	Must have been a long while ago.  Can't find any news report on this incursion.
t1_du3vsra	0	*	My metric counts vehicle miles.
t1_dvycx24	1	*	I love you S2

t1_du3hv30	1	*	Goddamn it. Alright Im just never gonna travel again.
t1_du33sgm	0	*	Yeah because the average Russian citizen has enough money to bother laundering.  
t1_du360nq	1	*	Not a bicycle.  Those things explode all the time.
t1_du2yotr	1	*	The list he provided was from the Wikipedia articulate of accidents and incidents  so you are correct - the near miss would fall into the latter category
t1_du2xmtf	0	*	No luck catching them swans then?
t1_du3jndj	1	*	Xenophobic lol 
t1_du35xhc	1	*	to be fair youre putting your life in the hands of an extremely well trained individual, not like its joe average from down the street
t1_du2yyzl	0	*	Because 71 people died, it shouldn't matter what country they come from for people to feel empathy for them but unfortunately a lot of Americans, not all but too many, won't care because foreigners.
t1_du2wwyt	1	*	I came close to a collision in a small Cessna. I got yelled at when I told the tower they said to turn on course too early. 
t1_du33typ	1	*	If you're scared because of lack of control, then how do you manage to survive this far? Waking up/stepping outside of your door and anything past that is typically out of your control.
t1_du2zl19	1	*	Nope
t1_du2zqbe	1	*	Same thing happened to me last September landing in Toronto. It caused a lot of people to miss their connecting flights for a Microsoft conference in Orlando.
t1_du358gc	1	*	Thats such a bullshit. I mean there are lots of slavic countires that have literally no connection to Russia, but their names sound similar, pure hatred generated for nothing. 
t1_du38fyl	1	*	Just remember that over 60% of plane crashes happen in Russia, it makes the stats drop down even further.
t1_du30er9	1	*	Crypt of currency. 
t1_du3977c	1	*	US shady shit doesnt make anyone elses shit less shady. Once you start making it relative youre already down that slippery slope of tit for tat that makes averythjng ok.
t1_du327up	0	*	You used to have to, but now they tie your licence to your BBC account so you have to log in to watch stuff. 
t1_du2xkt7	1	*	Yeah people don't seem to get that there's a time and a place, and this isn't it. 
t1_du2xey8	0	*	Kilometers per fucking minute 
t1_du2wkkv	1	*	Some smartass will always be a punk with you, don't worry about that, you're a decent lad!
t1_du32e4a	1	*	I can see the onion article now.   Skilled pilot saves lifes of passengers from tower fluke, 1-Star reviews flood internet
t1_du3vpsk	1	*	My stats are in deaths/injuries per mile
t1_du30xpd	0	*	No pitchfork, that's just some shitty stuff to say. Maybe I didnt see it in the right context, but either way, it was a bad choice of words. 
t1_du3clis	1	*	Something that pilot should never tell to his passengers. It's a useless info for passengers on board and will only generate anxiety or panic. 
t1_du36ypy	0	*	Which is less than could be said about the helicopter.
t1_du31ot2	0	*	Could you point me to that? These statistics are based on deaths/injuries per mile. How is that misleading?
t1_du3pcdf	1	*	By what you just said, american are complicit as they did nothing and allowed these actions to happen in their name with their tax dollars...
t1_du3vjti	0	*	Doesn't it cost much more to fly short distances like that, though? I've never looked into that part of it.
t1_du2xbrt	0	*	But they can be in VFR conditions on an IFR flight plan looking for traffic 
t1_du338g6	1	*	!isbot <st_Paulus>

t1_du37evk	1	*	I'm actually a cat go easy.
t1_du3bpj9	0	*	Plenty of Tupolevs and Antonovs fly to and from the EU too. It is the maintenance and the parts that is important. It is airlines who face challenges operating out of the EU for poor standards.
t1_du3rvug	1	*	If the base assumption is that it was still flying in 2016, then yeah its kinda weird to assume it can't still be flying around today. 
t1_dtjy0ia	0	*	Holy shit, where is that? It sounds awful.  
t1_dtjzabd	1	*	Communities need both. There have a lot of areas with massive housing shortages. They need mixed use: condos/apartments on top of shops, instead of malls, with space for outdoor activities.
t1_dtuqf4n	0	*	And usually more than two.  No one likes a pedant.
t1_dttyd5w	0	*	I was mostly making a joke, but I also have a habit of baiting controversial opinions/arguments on the internet. Too soon?
t1_dtu6lad	1	*	Obviously. The point is people need actual tangible help, not prayers. 
t1_dt5cs89	0	*	Or people with loads of money, the US is actually pretty good if you're rich. 
t1_dt5e2n6	0	*	>A meeting with the opposition  Fellow Americans? I mean obviously of a different political party but still, Americans.   You seriously are a child. 
t1_dt4th8h	0	*	Look, more condescending because you dont want to have an actual discussion with somebody who disagrees with you. Man, reddits great today.
t1_dt5cp7w	1	*	LG is a POS.

t1_dttnfzl	1	*	Words matter.  Thanks for clarifying!   :)
t1_ds4sxh7	1	*	Yeah keep telling yourself that.   There's almost 0 unemployment in the tech sector. 
t1_ds5ks1b	1	*	my family immigrated here legally fuck off
t1_ds4mu4c	0	*	> As someone working in IT  How was it for the company executives? Because they make the decisions, and likely care more about the bottom line than your nightmares.

t1_ds1i8qq	0	*	LOL I think I just did get away with a statement like that. I have a question for you. While we're on the topic of anti-semitic conspiracy theories, do you also think that Israel was behind 9/11?
t1_ds5zgow	1	*	Archaeologists say its Hebrew.  Fuckwad says:  durrr that sure done look like Assyrian to me...  Uh... Im gonna go with the archaeologists on this one.
t1_ds1lq4s	1	*	Hes a very unpopular troll.  Dont put too much effort in.
t1_dsdwrng	1	*	Thats not in addition though, is it?  If the conditions in El Salvador are so bad that were protecting them from their home country, then we need to do more.

t1_dtaad36	0	*	No flag in the world requires you fold it up into tiny squares. Hence they are brand new, not nearly folded.   What cause is that? My family is Jewish.  
t1_dta0jnn	1	*	I grew up Jewish in the deep south and people did all that shit too me, so can't really say it's surprising people would do it to a German-American.
t1_dtaphiw	0	*	As an American who lives in Germany, I am so embarrassed by her. Sorry. 
t1_dtaaf4e	0	*	Thats debatable. And free speech right?  And I dont see how that in any way merits what was done.

t1_dta6jnu	1	*	And somehow people still want more of it.
t1_dtafern	1	*	> I always thought these were just stereotypes  They are
t1_dt9z0qi	0	*	I'm certain some conservative fuckstick would absolutely believe this. And that's fucked up.
t1_dta3eln	1	*	Its not real.
t1_dtakbpn	1	*	Two years ago I would've thought telling Americans not to do the Nazi salute in public would be redundant (burning crosses is a different matter). 
t1_dtaaf3e	1	*	change both those terms as racist remarks and slavery and you're on the same path  its flawed logic, just saying
t1_dtaxz5j	1	*	>that province that hasn't won a championship handegg game in two decades
t1_dta51ad	1	*	This.
t1_dta8tz7	1	*	Kann konfirmieren.
t1_dtan2ve	0	*	I hope you satisfy her, if i hear complaints youd have a problem with me U0001f621
t1_dtbfs0j	0	*	Like wird usage in different countries? Except you think there is one right usage and thats the end of the story ;)
t1_dtasrp7	1	*	They're the exact same thing and to fine people for an opinion is just vile.
t1_dt9x8mq	1	*	Are technically acting against the law might be the best way to put it!
t1_dt9vaxw	1	*	Usually you have to demonstrate harm for defamation. I think you'll find it extremely rare someone suffered for being called a bastard or a nazi. 
t1_dta0sgp	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dtadgky	0	*	You gotta pump those numbers up!
t1_dta1uh9	1	*	Yeah because her being a professor in something ending in studies makes her by definition subpar. And her book? Even a broken clock is right twice a day. 
t1_dtam9jk	1	*	They're English majors trying to justify their degree. 
t1_dta8l8a	0	*	Miss is perfectly fine. She was just looking for something to complain about. 
t1_dt9ye9g	0	*	How can you prove something like that, and how can you be significantly affected by getting the bird from someone?
t1_dta2w81	1	*	Just clarifying the level of disaster we're talking about here. Seems wrong to minimize it down to a single word. 
t1_dt9xmma	1	*	[Reappropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation).
t1_dt9zhhc	1	*	I agree, and that is a form of assault IMO. The illegal part shouldn't be the actual words You are a pedophile but the fact that he was saying those words to inflict damage on their career.   
t1_dta5kud	1	*	I think you're over thinking things in a way that holds no relevance or importance on the way people live their lives right now
t1_dta0kc9	0	*	The last time you had a wall you were much more thankful for Americans. 
t1_dt9wox1	1	*	And his flannel shirt was rolled up to reveal tattoos! *gasp*  Yea this ladys a Cunt 
t1_dta0rnc	0	*	Yeah, I'm sure nazis had laws that prevented you from calling somebody a nazi.

t1_dtabl87	1	*	It's a slippery slope I think. People resort to lawyers way too much as it is. Suing someone just because they insulted you is drastic.
t1_dtad7uy	1	*	Also frequently enough women get insulted being called ma'am, whilst many older women also view being called miss as flattering. 
t1_dtacgy6	0	*	Ah yes, Arabs definitely fit the Aryan profile of white, blonde hair and blue eyes.
t1_dtanayq	1	*	> Its unclear whether the biker was booked for not having a licence plate  Of course he was. The law is still the law. And motorbike guy knows that too.

t1_dt9zo8u	1	*	Just doing their jobs, why would you want to try and convince them otherwise, right?  
t1_dtaivv2	1	*	I'd have accepted a couple of BCs or bhad mein jaaos thrown in as well 
t1_dt9wtgq	1	*	I agree with this - free speech minus hate speech is a good spot for what a country should support. 
t1_dt9rbhr	1	*	Please feel free to elaborate on that.

t1_dtaz5gd	1	*	No kinding right? Seriously though. Cant believe so many people think shes a bitch for her behavior and the subsequent write up she posted. To which I say, dilly dilly!
t1_dtat7n5	1	*	Please be a troll. Please be a troll. Please be a troll. It's difficult to comprehend this level of idiocracy.
t1_dt9w6ca	1	*	Knowing chemistry doesn't exclude ignorance.
t1_dtbunnv	0	*	So you're in favor of not opposing the Taliban?  Because that is the other option.
t1_dt9weq1	1	*	Americans.
t1_dtaiih0	0	*	Thoughts are one thing, rounding up people torturing them and coldly executing them with impunity is another thing entirely. So no, not Nazis.
t1_dtauo2u	0	*	its NOT like a parking ticket, its more like going to court in the US for lets say simple assault
t1_dtah4lg	1	*	What does this haircut look like? The Hitler jugend didn't have a specific haircut AFAIK.
t1_dta0zp9	1	*	*huge pun thread entails*

t1_dta9wzm	0	*	Help! Police! He said a bad word!
t1_dt9tmmb	1	*	That hype train ran out of juice
t1_dta2xot	0	*	Sorry, I think I have troubles parsing your sentence. Could you please explain wow you mean contradictory here?

t1_dt9vums	0	*	Not sure if joke, but it's a saying: 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'. That is to say you have to follow the laws in the country/state/etc you're in.
t1_dt9yuq9	1	*	You beat me to it! Completely right
t1_dtam59t	0	*	But wait, didnt she shoot him and sprinkle crack on his corpse? As an American, Im not understanding how they expect to eliminate crime without eliminating the criminals... U0001f914
t1_dtai4wh	1	*	Well, I could just make a book outta this section, I have a lot of material.
t1_dta6w2c	1	*	She's an idiot either way because the regulations for liquids are the same here in the states. Pack your bag properly and you won't have a problem.

t1_dta9byp	1	*	OMG I am stealing that!
t1_dtasncu	1	*	They are if your point is a motherfucker is being a motherfucker.  
t1_dtajsc1	1	*	No, US courts are likely to consider that a matter of opinion rather than fact, and opinions are immune from defamation.
t1_dtacm6b	1	*	About what?
t1_dt9x2nx	1	*	It's like when a celebrity will blow up about something no one would have cared about anyway and cause more buzz. I'm not saying it's right but people seem to do this all the time.
t1_dtap13h	0	*	Do you think we should redistribute the wealth?

t1_dtacs7n	1	*	Wow, anyone a specialist here in treating vicious burns?
t1_dtargye	1	*	It has a long-distance train station on site for crying out loud. It's not my favourite airport, but that's one complaint you can't make.
t1_dtaml0l	1	*	The slang for the cut in the US is the Jugend which is obv a reference to the Hitler Youth. It's not accurate, certainly, but that's where she got the vocabulary.

t1_dtatd13	1	*	I take deodorant with me on every flight no problem, no bag or anything.
t1_dt9z78g	0	*	Somebody is sounding a little #triggered. At least I have actual sources for what I'm claiming, you have nothing to back your claims up but assumptions and some sort of pent up emotions
t1_dta9ra6	1	*	Thanks, you proved my point. 
t1_dtafvnm	1	*	I've met a lot of dumb smart people in my life. Being educated doesn't necessarily make someone smart.
t1_dta0igu	1	*	No but in the US you would. Maybe not even by the security guards but people adoubxe9 you.  Or youd just get shot by a cop.
t1_dta9ydz	1	*	I mean if you really DO wanna pick cops to argue with, the EU ones are probably the best choice.
t1_dtaa77u	1	*	That's an unfair not-wholly-accurate generalization.  We're pretty dumb at home too.

t1_dszmy6v	0	*	The justification being that it's just like holding a spoon versus I HAVE ANOTHER PERSON'S ARM IN ME AHHHH
t1_dszf7mr	1	*	Dude, they're not giving people lithium water. They're measuring the amount of lithium in water and seeing if there's correlation with societal factors like suicide ratio etc.
t1_dszgkz5	1	*	Liberia. I'm being eaten alive (GONE SEXUAAAAAAL)
t1_dszi5on	1	*	did you mean to say the world? Cause i think you meant the world.
t1_dszjnif	1	*	Fewer people in the workforce will reduce the impact of automation as fewer jobs will be lost. Virtually every developed country is about to have its own crisis of unemployed people to take care.
t1_dsz6wu1	1	*	From what I understand, they are just measuring, they are not making anybody drink it.
t1_dszhd47	1	*	Think the Queen of England. It's symbolic. All true power is held by the prime Minister and the Diet.
t1_dszn8mu	1	*	Its like Germanys obsession with David Hasselhof

t1_du1gveo	0	*	You're stopping a groups of people from having children based on race/ethnicity. That's eugenics. You're promoting the master race ideology.
t1_duq9cja	1	*	Thanks, that makes sense.
t1_duojtxz	0	*	No shit, because we'll want them to be as smart as a human, but without the actual thinking.        I'm scared for advanced A.I., I don't think we'll know how to treat it correctly.

t1_dsxg4o1	1	*	Has been back for like two years lol.
t1_dsv4bvq	1	*	How about further rules on discourse: require acceptable sources, must be productive, 3 strike rules, etc. Also it would be one liar versus the world.

t1_duutt0z	1	*	Person A did a thing   Yeah but what about when person B did a thing?!  This is whataboutism.   Person A did a thing  This is not whataboutism.  Nobodys even saying what about  
t1_duqb0am	1	*	Plus legislation could change this equation in the meantime
t1_duqi5pw	1	*	> So.. The FBI and Mueller's spokesperson refused to comment?  First time reading an article about Mueller and his team, huh?
t1_duqgpmm	0	*	Didn't we have artillery all around their border for a while under Obama?

t1_duqdzfo	1	*	You think America is the most capitalist country in the world? Just wow.  Hint: Look at Africa.
t1_duq3ad4	0	*	Plus, they pulled off Brexit too. That's a lot worse than 4 years.
t1_duqmc2a	0	*	Threatening a school shooting is illegal. If you don't believe me, go try making a threat on Facebook. A former NFL player was taken into custody for that today! 
t1_duqeb8s	1	*	Seems to be the same fever dream gun nuts have around facing the us government with their pea shooter
t1_duq6slg	1	*	This got way too real all of a sudden.
t1_duqtcso	1	*	Totally agree, I think I like the stuff that Jad does and don't enjoy Robert's stuff as much. Also, I miss Oliver.

t1_dur7nrb	1	*	*incompetent* insanely corrupt bureaucrats. The article says pretty much everyone in an authority position who knew what the fuck they were doing was replaced by loyalists.
t1_dusd5zv	0	*	Government interference in the economy is an aspect of all economic systems. You really think capitalism could exist without government interference in the economy.

t1_durauh9	0	*	How many of those states were at one time as successful as Venezuela?
t1_duqxzpa	1	*	Every time, and every way tried so far it seems. When will they realise it's a failure of a model?
t1_durncoi	1	*	I never said it was right or wrong. But either way by definition it is terrorism. You added a connotation to the word 
t1_durd4ui	1	*	Thanks, great explanation. 
t1_duruelu	1	*	That's kind of my point. Germany is a real place, comic book solutions are a bad idea in real life. Particularly ones like the Punisher.
t1_dtdcb4u	1	*	The high cost of the death penalty comes from the numerous appeals given to people who receive a death sentence. Paying judges, prosecutors, public defenders, etc. The high cost isn't the drugs.
t1_dtb9ljg	0	*	Not in the modern sense of the word, they weren't wealthy for example. If you say that it only means people in power, then every country was always ruled by oligarchs since the dawn of time.
t1_dtbad8j	0	*	Worse than a paperback teen paranormal romance novel on the rack at Dollar Tree with a clearance sticker on it.
t1_dsflz0i	1	*	Possibly I misspoke.

t1_dshia21	0	*	Lol you're funny

t1_ds2x1v5	1	*	The ratios are even worse depending on the concentration. My aero classes have like 10:1 ratios.
t1_ds51pz4	1	*	Charisma is necessary. Sorry to people who suck at social interaction, but that is very necessary in much of business.
t1_ds3bm0r	0	*	I mean if you literally google it, first results. Are you a spastic?
t1_ds30k9v	0	*	So what you are saying is that women tend to bring drama into things... Maybe the boss just doesn't know how to work with women.  Mild observation.  We all have our off days.

t1_dsolvhx	0	*	Can I judge him based on his presedential campaign and how he acts as president currently?
t1_dsozj3a	1	*	He's also credited his wife and her Catholic influence as being a major reason behind the change in his attitudes 
t1_dsoy6oz	1	*	Tesla is a bit weird because the company wasn't made to make the most money but to get some change in the industry.
t1_dsosktz	1	*	Yeah that's true, generally people who rise to that sort of prominence don't do so by holding hands and singing kumbaya; can't make an omelette without cracking a few eggs.
t1_dsosryg	0	*	Ok kid.

t1_dsq0j4v	0	*	> Not exactly. He advocates   Yes, he pays lip services to dummies who believe words that fall from his lips - but where does the lobbying money go? The opposite way. Educate yourself.

t1_dsokmz9	1	*	And what youve read in the papers, court documents, accounts from those who know him personally, Netflix documentaries about his campaign advisors, etc...
t1_dspx7ac	0	*	then even still, if someone is going to be an evil douchebag, then I'd rather them toss a few billion into good causes along the way.

t1_dsooask	0	*	Isn't assuming that every single person who complains on Reddit doesn't do anything else about it also being kind of a bitch?
t1_dsofwv1	0	*	Yeah okay. Why don't you go back to confirming whether we live on a flat disk and Antarctica is just a giant wall or something?
t1_due335p	1	*	Until the Tory brain trust repeals it for being 'anti business'....
t1_duelck2	1	*	Is not so bad. Mapping PD in one project currently, I actually kind of like it. Can find inefficiencies and weird code :) 
t1_dt8e5tk	0	*	Because it doesn't have a nervous system  Edit: source: just finished a final in bio about the plante kingdom and several phylums.
t1_dskscrw	0	*	Right, right, we can't focus on anything besides comparing that thing to Trump, or else we're Russians.  Got it.
t1_dsky0qt	1	*	More like the foundation of trump attempting to change libel laws.
t1_dskq43l	1	*	I'm not sure what you're saying. Are you suggesting someone who's been president for 12 months and who's been president for half a fiscal year has had any impact on that?

t1_dskts77	1	*	And yet the economy [does better during liberal administrations](http://presidentialdata.org/). It's almost like pithy quotes don't actually mean anything.

t1_du7k2ts	1	*	I honestly don't see any peaceful long-term coexistence, total victory is required by one side for stability. And then that only deals with internal threats while magnifying external ones.

t1_dsfij3q	1	*	You can't oppress your political enemies if they committed an armed uprising. The point is invalid.  When there's no political medium between the sides, there can't be oppression, it's just war.
t1_dsfazg4	0	*	It's propaganda his supporters follow. He is in a position of power; he needs to start acting like it.
t1_dsfeuxc	1	*	No it does not. It is ridiculously silly. HuffPo is garbage though, so I don't know why anyone would except anything less from them. 
t1_dsflqwo	1	*	You still arent thinking?  You dont know why Trump would be considered for this?  Cmon, if you try really hard you can come up with a thought!
t1_dsfcepz	0	*	How is that hypocrisy? What ever happened to telling it as is? If I recall, the article is about Trump, not Obama.
t1_dsfbcfe	0	*	So you agree he didn't change the law or write a new one?
t1_dsfjc49	1	*	Cumhuriyet still exists, but that's pretty much anti-AKP propaganda at this point. There's no objective press left.

t1_dup9i8z	1	*	Loads of stuff to critisize as non-lethal, they hone in on rugby. Definitely kiwi. (Gotta love kiwis though)
t1_dv3l2nh	1	*	That's because it is a huge unprecedented problem, and because the media sensationalizes things. The latter is not a new problem.

t1_dv2529o	0	*	He will be indicted and/or impeached.
t1_dtxpte4	1	*	He didn't mention the word nazi once. He said if Germany occupies one of its neighbors the way Israel does, then Israel would have the right to complain.
t1_dud5gcy	1	*	I hate it when stuff is closed off to Canadians. Like I would gladly buy YouTube Red. But Google actively refuses my money. So instead I use Adblock on YouTube, because fuck ads.
t1_dtu4yjz	0	*	There was before something called a rebalancing in prior administrations, not in this one. No turning to the Center.

t1_dsctd0m	1	*	JAL is the only airline offering the 2-4-2. Everyone else has converted to 3-3-3. Sad!
t1_ds2zarh	1	*	honestly, at this point for the country, using their power grid to just mine bitcoin and other crypto's probably wouldn't be that bad of an idea.

t1_dsaafgk	1	*	Being corrected when you are wrong certainly does trigger you, huh?  Sad.
t1_ds8gor2	1	*	You've been here long enough to know what you're dealing with, Liz. It's national socialism for Jews aka zionism. 
t1_ds8n5z3	1	*	That proposal didn't go through, though. Science/engineering/medical courses in Iranian universities are still mostly women.
t1_ds8gb1t	0	*	>  I've never heard anyone on the left defend North Korea  So you've never heard anyone say that we should just let NK have nukes?

t1_dspe85z	0	*	That was really fucking opaque then
t1_dsqoxga	0	*	Russia isn't keen about nuclear-armed drones though. They have a similar nuclear surety policy to the US, two humans have to pull the trigger.
t1_dsp0iw4	1	*	No Russian
t1_dsrd8s0	0	*	And the bigger countries, like Russia?  Is it really sensible for either the US or Russia to trust the other to just stop making nukes and throw them all away?
t1_dspmdjk	1	*	theyre definitely invested in MAD, considering the amount of nukes they have. sure, some of them are really old, but they re still nukes
t1_dspgtbo	1	*	> Well, we're screwed then. If they say it was someone else it must be.  - President Donald J. Trump
t1_dson1ur	1	*	Welcome to the last 70 years.  It's been all about building doomsday weapons better and better in the hopes that the other side doesn't use theirs.

t1_dspkigs	0	*	And thank God for that.  Or at least the engineers.
t1_dsp3g68	1	*	But China does not want war since they are still building up their infrastructure in many parts of their country. Most likely they would simply side against the aggressor or attempt to be neutral. 
t1_dsowdna	0	*	Really?  Okay. Guess we should just disband our military and give up the 2nd amendment.  WW2 was enough to convince the world that wars are not worth it anymore!
t1_dsoyoip	0	*	Well it goes without saying that some Southerners will never accept an authority greater than a pedophile Senator.   But that hasn't stopped the march of progress.

t1_dslb3wg	0	*	> Maybe I just cant see how to bridge the divide  You don't.   It's impossible to have a productive debate with someone who doesn't accept facts and argues in bad faith.  Don't even bother.
t1_dsm38ht	1	*	She says he's won a prize for most annoying ad... Well the ad has anyway. His skills were great though. 
t1_dsl00bo	0	*	I think the those on the left continually inserting race, feminism, etc into every topic is equally divisive. Not that he isn't, just you only ever hear that accusation thrown at him.
t1_dsl5hkc	0	*	That was a slick move by Durbin, praising Graham for speaking up against it. Graham would have had to deny he ever said anything himself if he wanted to stay Trumps loyal butt buddy.
t1_dslcr0o	1	*	I see what you dewed there!
t1_dskztoh	0	*	So every military member is superior to every civilian?  Lmao fuck outta here with that nonsense.  If you want to play that game, look who the military voted overwhelmingly for in the last election.

t1_dsd5ee1	0	*	California is the single most populated state in the U.S. and the 5th largest economy in the world.  Why would it ever be excluded?
t1_ds3w10a	1	*	From the same article  ] As part of the settlement, the United States did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran but agreed to pay on an ex gratia basis US$61.8 million
t1_dtvnx22	0	*	So why are you coming in and complaining about the Canadian system if you'd be happy for the US to go to that system?

t1_dtvdkkx	1	*	Not English try again.
t1_dugcfoi	1	*	Probably a good idea not to give it to 6 year old Alfie. There are other side effects associated with it. He was doing well on the cannabis oil.
t1_dsm0ss5	0	*	I'm nowhere near his level. He's several meters underground, swimming in sewage.
t1_dsmn52z	1	*	Because Norway is so much smaller? But mostly because we are a nation of immigrants. It is who we are. Why are we trying to become more racist and afraid instead of becoming more compassionate?
t1_dstiavs	1	*	Why not?
t1_du0api8	0	*	Why should it matter if anyone elected them or not? Are unelected bureaucrats beyond reproach?
t1_du1tca9	1	*	thats my thought process too.  I would just sit there and maintain status quo.
t1_dtz15tr	1	*	Yep. It's hard to gauge it from an outside perspective, but it's really odd. I personally don't like him, but that's because he's going with China, and I think that's a terrible decision.

t1_dslwfp0	1	*	Maybe he's telling to read any one science textbook aka some science textbook.

t1_dsmjf5y	1	*	No, because it implies it has no 'brain' that runs the show. Humans have a ton of nerves, but the brain controls the system.
t1_dsm9naq	1	*	I've never worked in a kitchen before, but any restaurant that can't be bothered to use clean knives isn't worth their salt
t1_dsmaegt	1	*	We don't have big enough pots.

t1_ds8wz4i	1	*	do you want your nappies changed?
t1_duqbtmj	0	*	The use of internment camps like that in colonization was used first by the British, the Italians were just copying them.  How does that make this unique to Fascism.
t1_duotass	1	*	Doesn't matter.  As the dominate group gets marginalized fringe groups gain power.  Now do they seize power by force or by elections no idea but I expect mass expulsions to hit sometime in the future.
t1_dupf5mk	0	*	Your comment indicated that there is something objectionable or wrong with what I said, considering it contained negative terms such as spam.

t1_dupxmbp	1	*	>Allow the opinion to rise or fall based on its merit  Quick question... are you a white male?  
t1_dupekht	1	*	That's quite the false equivalence. The status quo is not violence. The fascist boogie man is manufactured. 
t1_duoztky	0	*	And on top of that, the left fails to realize that the right is far, far better at victim tactics than they are. 
t1_duqk7uf	1	*	Antifascists have zero sense of self awareness.

t1_du3zj2u	0	*	Fair enough. But why not just bring someone useful up to iss or something?
t1_dtjxuyw	0	*	So you support Assad?  Or do you support ISIS?  Because the groups the US works with absolutely support the US staying and helping end a *bloody civil war*
t1_dsuk0kr	0	*	The U.S. is in a country that doesn't want them there and there ain't a damn thing Syria or Russia can do about it, do you think a cut-off city will stop them?

t1_dupwumv	1	*	I edited my comment. 
t1_duqnu9c	0	*	It certainly sounds easier to treat mental health than it does to regulate millions of unregistered/ghost guns. 
t1_dur0uzi	1	*	But they won't remain peanuts if we can't get our political arguments worked out.  If the US ever shits the bed badly enough for another civil war, God help us.

t1_dseqsgr	0	*	Unless you actually provide numbers, this claim is highly debatable 
t1_dt0pkrv	1	*	Thats all you have to say? You cant refute it. You know that the Turkish government banned the use of their language, clothing and entire culture and thats why they rebelled. 
t1_dtfnphs	0	*	Then why even reply? 
t1_dtfcxim	0	*	What a ridiculous argument. Australia won't be gIft wrapping machine guns and sending them to the terrorists.   It's Australia, not USAustralia.

t1_dum58r2	1	*	Then find me some. There are western pollsters too.
t1_dum7jcu	1	*	Which is something you could say about any country on the planet. It's just that most don't have the resources or power to do what the US does.

t1_dumkbaf	1	*	Colloquially, all ships are boats, but not all boats are ships.  In the US Navy, all boats are ships, but not all ships are boats.
t1_dun0bcj	0	*	As in names to memorize, lol. Paradigm made it seem like we knew several dozen names, there are 10 total.
t1_dt5ymbs	1	*	Makes sense.  I can see them putting the onus on the developers and save themselves the headache.  That being said, as a non-EU citizen, I hope my options aren't reduced because of this legislation.

t1_dua6bw8	1	*	I think of a shooting in a school. Which is what they have defined it as. I don't think 'school shooting' could have a more literal definition than 'a shooting in a school'.
t1_dua4mll	0	*	Still possible. Doesn't undermine my argument
t1_dua4kmd	0	*	taking no action is an action.   clearly, the majority of Americans have already spoken on this.

t1_dua6m13	1	*	We did it, guys!

t1_dscbhk6	0	*	That's disingenuous because at the time the concept of white did not include those nationalities. Now they are all considered white because said fears are targeted towards the Muslim community now.
t1_dscf638	1	*	Go oooon.... *unzips*

t1_duktqar	0	*	China only increased their use of solar because it is now the cheapest form of energy per kW, at least in 60 or so countries. It's cheaper than coal. 
t1_duko8zw	0	*	Its Treeson Then.

t1_dujxpoc	0	*	>One year later, we have better results then we ever had before...  No we do not. Not even close.   
t1_duk4xki	1	*	Maybe because that link is a fucking disaster in mobile.
t1_dukbhnh	0	*	Yeah but that applies to all situation, no? You can cut funding for health care, military, infrastructure, economy, and let private organizations fend for themselves.
t1_dukid8a	0	*	You guys are awesome. 
t1_dukh5ji	1	*	And then the biosphere dies as plants suffocate. GG no re. Life on Earth can withstand high carbon environments just fine. It cannot withstand a zero carbon environment.
t1_dukp5hq	0	*	I rest my case
t1_dukp9p2	1	*	You never know. Life is funny like that, and some of the best solutions are counter-intuitive. 
t1_duuypig	0	*	Kind of like the riots by liberals that destroyed people's livelihoods after Trump won the election?
t1_duk4ja7	1	*	At least we would freeze to death before becoming hungry ;)
t1_dul9cv9	0	*	But you are still opposed to environmental regulations? My god this American bullshit is just pathetic. 
t1_dukadcz	0	*	Really? Most hospitals are 100% privately funded?  I wasn't aware, but if that's the case, we can get stuck up on that one weak analogy I used if you'd like

t1_dtvq3pc	1	*	you just got served u/stansburywhore
t1_dthbqol	1	*	It has been shown to be a false narrative when it comes to big game and the increasing number of animals being placed on protected lists. Never mind the poacher problems etc.

t1_dtgs6ki	0	*	I don't think he cared considering he was killing humans kept in a pen
t1_dtgrmoe	1	*	In this case the cage is 75 square mile and you're inside it with the lion.
t1_dth14yp	0	*	Would it be ok for these countries to sell tags to hunt hunters?   Its all creepy as hell.
t1_dtgxd50	0	*	What else is it then? 
t1_dtgq0qc	0	*	True. They'll tell you it helps animals and people but it doesn't. Not when pennies to the dollar is what ends up helping.
t1_dtgsvl1	1	*	Perfect, let's take your inside knowledge and pull some Ocean's 2 shit to smuggle some barrels out!
t1_dtgtace	1	*	I don't know.  You can eat lion meat.  It's available for sale even in some places.  It wouldn't surprise me if they kept the meat but I don't really know.
t1_dtgwf9l	0	*	well that's a reasonable start to have an actual discussion. my take away from that book was black lives matter, hbu?
t1_dtgt58c	1	*	You can be sad animals are killed without being happy a hunter is killed.
t1_dtguqs9	1	*	I live in one for 6 years wbu?
t1_dtguaqp	0	*	They were very forward thinking. The people in the communities actually own the animals.  They don't want you killing that shit for free or killing off their resource.
t1_dtgu062	1	*	Indeed. While I make humble donations to the WCS, I'm neither rich nor have any interest in killing animals.
t1_dtgs6xw	1	*	Either way, rich assholes do something somewhat good.  These people aren't likely to donating money to preserves if given a chance.

t1_dt3z0k1	1	*	Switzerland checking out?  Its atleast checking out for me..
t1_dt3z9dd	1	*	Yeah, brush up on that English haha. I do get what you mean. A lot of people think of the traditional tidal wave when tsunamis look nothing like that.
t1_dt3wua6	1	*	What advice? There is no wisdom in your post. Youre  just being a cranky old man complaining about the youths.   This is why no one, regardless of age, will ever listen to you.
t1_dt3zqk5	1	*	Warnings for BC have been cancelled.
t1_dt3x3lq	1	*	Cream floats, shit sinks. Maybe the older and wiser shouldn't be worried about updoots.
t1_dt3vl86	1	*	I would be surprised if it damaged anything in Anchorage. My only concern is potential landslides and avalanches that could have been triggered.
t1_dt3zhws	1	*	Currently at the community centre in Port Hardy. We have several evacuation zones full of people. Just waiting on the news and reports. Will we get hit before Tofino?

t1_dtof6j7	0	*	Idk, sorry if I dont begrudge these women their job, it seems like a hateful space to be in
t1_dtode4b	0	*	I'm sorry but have you worked a day in your life?  That's not how jobs work.  This isn't 1940.
t1_dtodu4o	0	*	Who do you think pays the ad agency? 
t1_du88q5y	0	*	Yeah training lizards to feel radioactivity is nontraditional in the same sense as training in telepathy; Nature simply doesn't work that way.

t1_dupptwi	1	*	Yeah and they gotta learn English too, huh? 
t1_duqb9ui	1	*	Annoying yes, but not useless. Dissatisfaction is not fun, but I feel it is a driver for success, particularly if it is paired with a strong desire to improve upon things.
t1_durl0tw	1	*	Not to detract from other countries but I singled out Germany because the original post was about Germany. Yes, the UK and thereabouts will probably suffer greatest from a declining gulf stream. 
t1_duptxx5	0	*	Michael: We have a surplus. Imagine that your mommy and daddy gave you $10 to start a lemonai-  Hank: I know what a surplus is.
t1_dupigoh	0	*	Socialism is older than both Marx and Lenin, and predates the idea of Marxist Communism. So to say it must always be a precursor to Communism is flat out wrong.  Maybe follow your own advice.
t1_dupsb6m	1	*	It scales with income. It is around 7% of the before tax income.
t1_dupioyx	1	*	Not punching someone in the face doesn't imply you have to hug them, there is a middle ground you know.
t1_dupjn7a	1	*	No probs bae. 
t1_dupha6y	1	*	My point is that, if a government feels the need to bolster their defenses against something, they can and do go the extra mile to achieve that. 
t1_duplduq	0	*	Basically its a debate on whats the lesser of two evils and fundamental differences in culture probably contributes to a positive or negative view to coal and nuclear.
t1_dupjhl1	0	*	How can you call society socialist if the people hasn't seized the means of production? If the bourgeois still owns all the factories and all the farmland?
t1_duq73s7	0	*	lol ok
t1_dupnxi9	1	*	You are comparing raw dollar amounts and not % of GDP. The US spend 3.3% of GDP on defense, that's much less than what some countries like Russia, and Israel spend.

t1_dupr5tt	1	*	What you said wasn't hate speech, he just made a dumb joke.
t1_duqmc7a	0	*	Well said. That is precisely the issue. Americans have a justifiably warped sense of government. 
t1_dupqx0r	1	*	So much waste.
t1_duqbgyb	1	*	As a mexican who has worked as a mexico-based consultant for an american company. I second that lol.  My american peers were paid like 3-4x as much if not more.
t1_dupgk69	0	*	>  because it incorporates elements of socialist ideology  which is of course very far from actual socialism, so why call it socialism?
t1_dupic0v	1	*	Only orange ones sorry /s
t1_dupo5qz	0	*	You mean the party that was in opposition for the last 12 years? If the green party would have been in power, we would have reduced the amount of coal plants massively.
t1_dupwxae	1	*	mhm.  The putting it on ebay and people buying segments had some interesting reads.

t1_dupibun	1	*	Germany? After ww1 they just got huge debt, after two I'm not sure if they did. The attitude was a rebuild one instead of punish. 
t1_dupk56q	0	*	true, i was being hyperbolic.   i know it pisses americans off, but military spending is simply a waste of money for half the european countries. which is why many will never meet the nato goal.
t1_dupqv9c	0	*	Even worse is that the press covers that instead of people who actually know what they're doing. The media on both sides is definitely guilty of this. 
t1_duq0cj5	1	*	They have that in the Moscow airport I think.
t1_duq01vf	1	*	That one's on me, I forgot my /s
t1_dupg25q	0	*	> general Mexican way of thinking  Do explain.  *grabs popcorn*
t1_dupjvpg	0	*	The full amount probably isn't necessary, I'm not a proponent of bloated military spending. However, it isn't the source of our deficit issues. The numbers bear that out. 
t1_dupt9ia	0	*	Cant and Don't are two different things.    In America, the political Left has fought against every attempt to enact voter ID laws.  
t1_dupsywy	0	*	I didn't realize you meant our police are useless when they are actually needed.  Glad I could help!
t1_duptxet	1	*	Trump might poop in his own bed because there wasn't any from the Obama years.
t1_dupkevi	0	*	Nuclear fanboys have zero idea how to handle the waste. 
t1_duqat1g	0	*	China is more advanced than the US? Not sure about that pal. Getting there, in a few generations maybe but... I don't see it right now.
t1_duprdhe	0	*	And what's that, pray tell.  A democratic system under threat by an evil boogeyman opposite whatever partisan belief you have? 
t1_duppn47	0	*	And when you say pretty big drain, how much is it compared to that 44.9 billion surplus?
t1_dupzkpl	1	*	No, Republicans changed the terminology from Social Security to Entitlements, to create a sense of people feeling (unjustly) entitled to something. 
t1_dupsxyt	0	*	There was no word about america. You alone made it about american beers because you felt not respected enough. 
t1_dupibs7	0	*	Are you saying you aren't willing to do that for a secure border? Well you must hate Murica.  /s if it wasn't obvious. 
t1_dupgrzu	0	*	Because someone's deficit is another persons surplus by definition.  It really doesn't matter what you spend the money on it is absolutely impossible for everyone to have a surplus.
t1_dupihjv	1	*	Pre NAFTA. 
t1_dur2did	1	*	Exactly
t1_dupozyb	0	*	Still German bonds had negative interest last year or two years ago. You literally had to pay them to lend them money. 
t1_dupfmxf	1	*	How is that fair? If people want to kill themselves, they should be able to..
t1_dupu2af	1	*	Ironic considering they're doing trials and tests to consider using psilocybin as a medicine.
t1_duq266p	1	*	And you live somewhere with less traffic...
t1_duprssi	1	*	Back in the 70s and 80s? Try present day US.

t1_duq2yp9	0	*	Actually not just Europe. GM too. Nobody cares about it tho. They just mention VW over and over 
t1_dupj1ab	1	*	Because it coincides with Russia being more and more aggressive in the east of Europe ...  Oh and coincidence, it comes from Trump !
t1_dupb1dn	0	*	Tobacco lobby losing to the health care lobby i think.  Spent some time in Italy last year, those guy know how to peddle cheap Ciggys!
t1_dupdjcl	0	*	So the solution is to kill the EU and that will get you cheaper food or what's the logic there? You really think your economy would profit from a chechia without the EU? Help me out
t1_duq2b06	1	*	Reasonable politicians from both sides should come together and form a new centrist party. The duopoly is clearly not working.
t1_duq3029	1	*	> I guess having race riots and ethnic No go zones is very appealing to European liberals  Yes that's definitely what it is. Your arguments are very convincing.
t1_duptbx2	1	*	So what you're saying is you missed the entire point of my last comment?

t1_dupe5h6	0	*	Good for EE, bad for NE.
t1_dupqfbh	0	*	yep and allies too, which end up in the hands of enemies in a decade, who then kill American soldiers with them.  Can't fight a fake war without a boogyman, so we have to create them.
t1_dupi5ne	0	*	Germany apparently. After fukushima they announced they were shutting things down. Even though they don't get hurricanes and are in a geologically stable area....
t1_durub6a	1	*	Importing non-Brits isn't some force of nature, and modernization doesn't depend on it. The UK would be better in every meaningful way if there were no Arabs and Africans in it. Prove me wrong.
t1_duq0mqc	1	*	Shaming Europe in a Euro centric thread? That's a ~~paddlin~~downvotin'. 
t1_dupqgy6	0	*	Fraudulently obtained Social Security numbers. This is extremely common. The SS numbers have no security features.

t1_dtmwu3r	0	*	Could you explain how the crimes manafort is charged with tie to the Trump campaign? 
t1_dtn9zxp	0	*	You said absolutely nothing about the memo. You just went off on a cringy Trump Derangement Syndrome rant.
t1_dsflt03	1	*	stating facts is not mutually conducive with consent. :)
t1_dt6iefr	0	*	In every single way ever.  It's wild capitalism over there. In the West there are miles of red tape, in China a few yuan given to the correct person and you can do whatever you want.

t1_dt6j9mx	1	*	It does if you are using the republican explanations to what fake news is. You should read the other posts in this thread instead of sliding in at the ass end to discuss things we've already covered. 
t1_dt6j9mm	1	*	I mean, when there's one containment sub and like 20+ astroturfed subs, its like choosing between a shit sandwich and giant douche
t1_dt6cksr	1	*	Hes not dead yet, hopefully he has many years left in him.
t1_dt6jvuw	1	*	Oh no, I get that, but my point was that initially it was that Macedonian town pumping out article after article on anything and everything. 
t1_dt6hy6g	1	*	If claiming that Gays and Atheists can go to heaven and pointing out climate change is considered progressive, we have a serious problem. Also stop raping kids.

t1_dt6pn8n	0	*	Yeah no, the liberal Media is not fake news regardless of how many tweets Trump sends to the contrary 
t1_dt8d6iv	0	*	Why are abortions terrible, because you're murdering babies?  Murdering babies is okay if mothers don't want them?  Early stage fetuses are not sentient so it's not an issue of morality.
t1_dt6grs6	1	*	Bless his child molester protecting soul. 
t1_dt8tovc	1	*	I want to be 100% clear about this: I'm not defending CNN's shitty journalism regarding this story. However, in what way is this manufacturing a false story out of whole cloth?
t1_dt6jlcu	1	*	false equivalency and you know it. 
t1_dt6wbnj	0	*	At least they attempt to care for the poor, unlike the republicans.

t1_duh4efr	1	*	Literally not true.
t1_dugyt7i	1	*	Lol whatever you say, I'm not trying to argue...merely point out how dumb you come across.  I never tried to make a point.  Seriously, learn 10 year old grammar if you wish to make arguments online.  
t1_duhr5lk	1	*	Talking shit mostly. Copy and pasting stuff he said and then a media or scientific response. Did it daily for a while.
t1_duhdaod	1	*	Oh that makes more sense but Im fairly sure its hear hear perhaps we should all change it 
t1_dugy319	1	*	You know it's impossible for Trump to have some pride in authorship. He doesn't know the meaning of the word. Unless the word is prefaced with the word white anyway.
t1_dugt3s8	0	*	It's a reference to some nonsense that someone on Team Trump said 
t1_dugt9g2	1	*	Lol I know that its bullshit, but trumpeteers eat that shit up regardless of the credibility of their sources lol.  Good on you for providing a source, too!
t1_dugzmce	0	*	He fueled racial tensions and riots because black people finally felt they had a voice and got deservedly angry.
t1_dugqiqe	0	*	It's good to close your eyes when you sing the anthem, because then you won't see people taking a knee to it and you won't need to acknowledge the intricate racism embedded in the anthem.
t1_dugzzqm	1	*	Pigs' lifespan is approximately 8 years; cheetos' lifespan is closer to 8 days. It seems Trump has already lived well beyond his genetically-allotted time.

t1_dugsbm8	0	*	Are we really having this debate?

t1_dugt9qz	0	*	> random democrat senators  Is #21 on the ladder not high enough to be considered Top Officials?
t1_dugvze6	1	*	It's actually that the most diverse in political opinion choose the president, and in actuality, wasn't it Michigan, Wisconsin and PA, that were really the choosers this time.
t1_dugw5bq	0	*	Lmfao. Are you really blaming Mexico for your problems?

t1_dugqab8	0	*	/u/catens would be right if more people actually voted but disinterest, distrust, suppression, and apathy prevent us from having a better consensus.
t1_dugzftl	1	*	He did an outstanding job defending the undefendable

t1_dugw2le	0	*	It's not just clean coal.  They're taking regular coal. And cleaning it.   
t1_dugyyt5	1	*	The 50%+1 votes needed to win the electoral inherently and heavily favors against anything except a two-party system. 
t1_dugv9jc	1	*	Lol maybe you need to learn when statements are to be taken literally or figuratively, otherwise your life may be unknowingly spent in a hamster wheel!    
t1_dugv66g	1	*	Is the UK even investigating that?  Because they really should.  
t1_dugsjoj	1	*	That is an excellent point :)
t1_dugk2x0	1	*	Here's How Bernie Can Still Win
t1_duhsr2c	1	*	Because he was the only one saying the bad things were the colored peoples fault.  That message resonated with a lot more people than most of us would have thought.

t1_dugq9so	1	*	How is 30% of Americans voting for a man who puts America first terrifying to you?  Do you want America to fail?

t1_dugzs0x	1	*	https://imgur.com/a/uRxqK
t1_dugpqte	1	*	Yeah, that's my point. FPTP tends towards a 2-party system.
t1_duhe7z5	0	*	Real question is if they initially voted for Bernie cos he was the only chance at an improving the country from the list
t1_dugpy7g	1	*	Remember when Bernie had almost no name recognition and the entire Democratic establishment and DNC against him?
t1_dugqolo	1	*	The system is only flawed when it doesn't work in their favor.
t1_duuil7e	1	*	And I just want to ad, Islamism and terrorist Islamism are not the same, pushing a political or religious agenda does NOT necessitate the use of violence.  keep your critical spirit up, guys 
t1_dutvzuz	1	*	I'm pretty sure I saw it with the in a few days. Though I don't see an asterisk so apologies if I'm mistaken.
t1_dtd53dy	1	*	It takes longer than you think to stop associating with something you used to heavily support. There's always going to be doubt and denial that goes with the process.
t1_dtun4u9	0	*	And how is more worse? I don't see a point to your argument
t1_dt29hhw	0	*	No, hes right Im fucking retarded.

t1_dtmjaal	0	*	It was a legitimate question I wasn't trying to be rude.  I just didn't have time to research it myself.  *grins*
t1_duvixpz	0	*	Debt is not a resource. Fiat currency is debt based money. So I think s/he's correct when saying that currency isn't pegged to a resource.
t1_du1dgjd	1	*	You asked why it was morally wrong. IMO, it's morally wrong to do something that might result in the deaths of innocent people if it provides no benefit.
t1_ducocyy	1	*	it is super rare to read real critical writing in anti china threads.  good points.  
t1_dubz8kw	0	*	Fun fact: That is completely irrelevant to what I said.
t1_dubzjz3	0	*	The answer you are trying to imply is obvious.  I want you to spell it out exactly so I can explain to you why you are wrong without you later being able to claim I didn't fully destroy your position.
t1_dud1alx	0	*	They're not coerced. Don't like the rules? Then don't do business in China. China isn't forcing businesses to set up shop in China.
t1_dud4dgq	0	*	In 2001?  They were the sixth largest economy in the world at that point.  So I suppose you could make that argument but it be a monumentally stupid one
