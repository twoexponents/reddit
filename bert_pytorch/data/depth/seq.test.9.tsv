t1_dumtnca	1	*	Absolutely not

t1_dunozke	1	*	Many people are good people and refuse to accept corruption even if they could gain from it. Honesty is still a thing.
t1_dumchc2	0	*	> Who cares who else is corrupt?  Because if you are comparing systems, you compare results.  There is no economic system that has shown to be less susceptible to corruption than capitalism.  
t1_dsln7yz	1	*	I'm not near as dumb as you. Good luck getting your winner reelected
t1_duans0x	0	*	It's also not touching on the point that rich people can afford private healthcare whilst the NHS is being gutted and it's becoming near impossible to get GP appointments

t1_ducpaid	1	*	Well yeah, everyone is basically retarded haha, living is hard
t1_dua94vp	0	*	It's not but it's easier. You're not dealing with rational though, too, so that enters into account.

t1_dt2m5vk	1	*	No they're talking about the slave camp in Arizona
t1_dt2dzhu	1	*	Let me guess, you're part of the jet fuel can't melt steel beams crowd? There is absolutely no proof that 9/11 was a false flag
t1_dt2in07	1	*	I guess it depends on whether the doctor did it primarily for money/the promise of a visa or because he believed that he was doing the right thing.
t1_dt2fq51	1	*	???
t1_dt5p839	1	*	Yeah all 779 of them are innocent God fearing men who'd never hurt a fly. What's it like over in Unicorn town?

t1_dufr2lf	1	*	What you're saying here is that a truck is not a vehicle because it's not the same as a car.
t1_dugpldx	0	*	So? Why would anyone expect Russia to respect international law when the USA and NATO do not? They'd be retarded to allow themselves to be held to a higher standard than we are.

t1_ds8z6pf	0	*	Maybe if we multiply our powers...
t1_ds968vg	0	*	You need a few million more zeroes 
t1_ds9fhey	1	*	You're absolutely correct. I'm sorry, my joke-dar has been a little off as of late. 
t1_ds974qn	0	*	It's also just easier to prove a single number than to find a prime in all numbers. The hard part is checking all (some, that's part of the solution) of the numbers on the way 'quickly'.
t1_ds9fv6p	1	*	Just draw a giant circle and measure it. 
t1_ds96jrf	1	*	Impressive if true
t1_ds9gqrc	0	*	> There are some rather complex formulas that can determine whether a number is prime or not   Don't they only prove if something is likely prime?

t1_ds93mz3	0	*	Seeing as working quantum computers already exists (though not the kind that could solve this problem), it doesn't seem that farfetched.
t1_ds9j9cr	1	*	Also not sure how maths would be easier? Perhaps more modern maths, and computer science stuff.
t1_ds96yoq	1	*	because you haven't filled it yet?  or because it has some movies or TV shows on there too?

t1_du44viu	1	*	Black Flags is great too.
t1_du3piwe	1	*	You mean you have to buy second hand tanks because of the F-35 jet?
t1_dsesbok	0	*	Yes the first part is correct. The second part is speculative.
t1_ds24553	1	*	another pointless post, troll
t1_dtoeobq	0	*	Did you factor in that they may have meant it was the court costs and the loss of vehicle cost/recovery as well as job income lost? Doesn't seem unreasonable to say it can get up to 20k+. 
t1_dtoahkg	1	*	your argument is fucking bogus, its about torque and bhp output.  volvo's been making 800 bhp engines with straight 6 blocks for years now.

t1_dulxcut	1	*	Germany is still a saver pace than the US - if you mean that.
t1_dulx5lt	1	*	Funny thing is that is the definition of criminal. So deporting criminals who haven't comitted a crime is still questionable.
t1_du4n0n4	1	*	200 years later, they still cry that we, Portuguese, are at fault for everything bad that happens there, so nothing new.
t1_dsq4v60	0	*	She filed a false police report.  Take her to trial, convict her and lock her up. She has done incredible damage to the Muslim community.
t1_dsjcvdc	1	*	I knew a German American that owned an engineering firm.  Does that count?
t1_dtgglau	0	*	Youre completely missing my point.  My point is, if Yeltsin is what you get when you elect someone fairly, maybe its better to just have a dictator, because lets face it, Yeltsin ruined Russia. 
t1_due2ix3	0	*	Africa belongs to the countries in Africa. Diplomacy is practiced in regards to other countries, its  time to acknowledge Africa with dignity and respect. This other bullshit is for the birds.

t1_ds8uizj	0	*	Which cultures?
t1_dunaddw	1	*	It's vague but makes a lot more sense than trying to compare gun deaths, which is like trying to compare rape rates between Sweden and the UK, they aren't relatable figures
t1_dun99zd	1	*	I am American. I can assure you that you have much less of a mass shooting problem. 
t1_duggr20	1	*	Thylacine were tiny and I very much doubt they ate kangaroos. Dingoes are more like scavengers than predators.

t1_dsu34hp	1	*	You mean they attacked the people who were ethnically cleansing them..
t1_dsuleez	0	*	Israel is not the one causing conflict and no they are not building any bases on land that is not theirs.  again, it is time that all decent people in the world stop rewarding riots and terrorism.

t1_dutxkz0	1	*	Serves 'em right.  Everyone knows it's bad luck to burn an umbrella indoors.

t1_dutpih2	1	*	I keep telling myself that. I gotta stop dating people who are friends w my friends this shit is for the birds.

t1_dv4bezx	1	*	>I don't get it either.  That's because reality is a bit different to r/australia.
t1_dv4fc6d	1	*	Generally any network speed is measured in Mbps. MBps is usually only seen with I/O measurement, like hard drive write speed.
t1_dv4avgi	0	*	That was my point, even at 20mb you should have been able to do everything no problem. Its like owning a ferrari with no wheels. Sure, it can go 200mph, but with no wheels on, that's kinda tough.

t1_ds5dg0a	0	*	Fair enough then, we agree.  Not really sure this had much to with gender pay gaps themselves, but interesting all the same.
t1_ds5jpbq	1	*	It's not that i don't think that people deserve to know what others make, i just fear most people not understanding the nuances of *why* some people are paid what they are. 
t1_ds26vhz	0	*	Yeah, you're not wrong there.  More sanctions were voted for Russia.  Trump just failed to enact them.  They're still sitting on his desk, if I recall correctly.
t1_dulovjj	1	*	To be fair, the Rick and Morty stuff has died down a bit since the last season ended. But go to deep into the fandom and you'll feel unclean.

t1_ds2mytx	1	*	I'm referring to sweatshops, i.e., the reason everything imported from China is so cheap. 
t1_dtj7rvp	1	*	You're right...you don't usually get banned. You just get downvoted to oblivion to where no one can see you disagreeing with them. Same thing dude.
t1_dtj1g0l	1	*	Those security agencies do what their dictator tells them to, GP's problem is that government agencies act on their own without oversight. 
t1_du265fr	1	*	sorta like jelly on toast?
t1_du15k13	1	*	Yet you managed to be even more childish. Well done!
t1_dto1wn1	1	*	Yeah because they vetod it every time. Now that the UK is gone there will be a EU army shortly no doubt.

t1_dtnxs8v	1	*	I don't even know where to start
t1_dtnyrnr	1	*	Every bakery I've worked at (three and a pizza place where I made dough) they used metric. Grams are more precise and it's easier to scale up or down with changing batch sizes.

t1_dtnyadh	0	*	Too complex for your progressive and forward-thinking mind? Ah, I apologize for wasting your time

t1_dv0d3sl	0	*	Yeah that was the joke :)

t1_du29zv0	0	*	Tending to your backyard by overthrowing other people's governments because they aren't acting in your interest. That's textbook imperialism.

t1_durf84u	1	*	Japan was not a victim.  Once again, Japan brought the war on itself.  You can push emotion all you want by bringing up civilians, but that is a cop out as all civilians on all sides were targeted.
t1_durtukg	1	*	you do know who Kurt Vonnegut's source on his numbers for dresden was, right? Irving. Irving's source was Goebbels.

t1_dt2f45b	1	*	Why do they do it if it affects no one?  By 'sanctions' I mean the veto to the EU and NATO. Now, that isn't tangible, is it?
t1_ds4mtk0	0	*	is there any proof?  provides no proof or sources. Got a source for the 10 thousand statement you made? Not that I disagree I fucking hate NK. I'm just saying. 
t1_ds5b1od	1	*	Look at this guy talking about people's looks!! Real mature. Superficial and all!
t1_ds50cfb	1	*	Most dont, and thats not (political) party specific. Both sides have too many sheep
t1_ds4qy9z	1	*	Of course no one's defensing North Korea here. North Korea is strong so long as Deal Leader is running things! The Leader is good, the Leader is great, surrender your will as of this date.

t1_du8mjhv	0	*	And I'm pointing out that people are still about to make a strawman out of that position... asshole?
t1_du8f16b	0	*	In which: Why bother with a donor registry at all? Then simply force all to be a donor and take whatever you need.
t1_du94bqq	1	*	Thank you for this discussion, you don't see this everyday.
t1_du8hsb1	1	*	I don't care about the upvotes and the general vibe of the law is indeed very good. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't leave holes that should be fixed.
t1_du8xnf2	0	*	A will is who you give it to. Because you dont own it anymore.  Edit: if you still owned it, you wouldnt need a will in the first damn place.

t1_du9gly8	0	*	You realize the /s doesn't really make that comparison make any sense, right? They're still nothing similar between this and a draft.
t1_du8txln	1	*	The same way his dad got murdered. Pay attention if your wife gets too chummy with you mom or grandma. 
t1_du8iyo8	0	*	I'll look into that, thanks for the heads up.   I wonder if I'd be of any use as a donor. I've been young and really really really stupid, really hope I can still be useful after I die. 
t1_du96381	0	*	No one told them to invade Israel. It was the British's land, and their right to give it to Israel. Had the Arab League not felt the need to drive the Jews to the sea, there wouldn't be this mess. 
t1_du8ppbn	0	*	Not everyone is like that. Some stick to their guns pretty well 
t1_du8u8my	0	*	Then why are you in Israel? You really shouldnt be living there and taking up space/resources if you hate it. I dont care if I get voted down for this. Go be somewhere thatll make you and Israel happy

t1_du8h9pz	0	*	Any examples of these ethics nightmares?
t1_du98jw0	0	*	The issue of letting the kid die will come up in this situation WHETHER OR NOT they allowed organ donation. So I don't think organ donation is worth mentioning in this situation.

t1_du0qn5q	0	*	Well that's why I don't give a shit about it for currency purposes. I'm in, i'm out. fuck holding. 
t1_dtpj1mu	1	*	People who only want to listen to things that confirm their preconceived biases. 
t1_dtp5zcz	1	*	I would expect both parties to deny it if it was real. Neither would benefit from admitting it happened. The fact that the only source is Fire & Fury brings in way more doubt.
t1_dtp2m2d	0	*	And the NFL!
t1_dtpewc0	1	*	Agreed. That's an NPO
t1_dtp8ayf	1	*	That and the dog one were at the top of my list.  
t1_dtplsxd	1	*	This seems to be Papa Legba, the gatekeeper and intermediary between the humans and the loa in Carribean Voodoo. It's probably a reference to William Gibson's Neuromancer.

t1_dum1p7e	0	*	But...if China is cracking down then they are illegal. 
t1_dumiyf2	0	*	The tacky, self adhesive wallpaper they wrap around the can adds like $400 to the price. A plastic bag in a cardboard box is no extra charge. It weighs like 10 pounds.
t1_dumdyy9	0	*	Some of that was funded from the US as well.  Parades out in the open, that raised money that was used to buy weapons.
t1_dsko366	0	*	After WWI and WWII, absolutely. One of the main causes of WWII was endemic poverty caused by crippling war reparations after WWI.
t1_dskw7e4	0	*	It was the worst storm in almost a decade and caused over 600 deaths/15 billion in damages.   Also, what if it stalled, like what happened in Houston.     Summerville is fairly prone to flooding too.

t1_dsku7pl	1	*	Again, so you people are countering Trump's offensive behaviour by offending Slovenians.
t1_dsxk29k	0	*	Valuable, but not that valuable.  The market has set wages in the food service industry rather low, because most jobs there are pretty low-skill.

t1_dtvkpym	0	*	That still leaves you at about 90xb0 from your original direction
t1_dtvue0j	0	*	ok, but one persons experience doesnt account for an entire continent of happenings..  that, and the fact that they could be lying

t1_dtvceyt	0	*	No YOU'RE the dumb dumb (making fun of your style of argumentation)
t1_dtvfzok	0	*	No no.   Some human's lives < animal's life.
t1_dtvffv7	0	*	You keep editing this and it keeps getting better.
t1_dtvirve	0	*	Considering we dont need to eat meat or wear leather there is no justification. Both are instances of animals being killed for human enjoyment. 
t1_dtvenq3	1	*	It has purpose, but it's a shitty excuse of a purpose that only serves to make the hunter feel good about themselves
t1_dtvdxnn	1	*	Exactly. Just like teeth, claws and other evolutionary advantages. Whatever evolution gave us and effectively utilized is an accomplishment. Ours just so happens to be clever noggins.
t1_dtw4656	1	*	Look at the rest of his posts.
t1_dtvluti	0	*	Non-human animals should have the same right to life that you describe.

t1_dtvru9h	1	*	Yeah, I agree. 
t1_dtvoik0	0	*	Im gonna need a source on that, i dont believe it
t1_dtw3iyw	1	*	It's always funny that people can't come up with arguments against this. Very well said mate.
t1_dtvcay2	0	*	Thats not even what trolling means. And there is no rule saying that lol. Stop making things up.
t1_dtvyjw3	1	*	Active camouflage tanks. I know that a prototype for a tank invisible to thermal imagery exists. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py1P2vVfnl8
t1_dtvjpzz	1	*	I've seen these photos before but seeing them again made me very sad. Why would they do that??? Why do people enjoy such a horrific hobby??
t1_dtwyyzh	1	*	That is the claim by hunters. Nobody in this discussion has produced evidence.
t1_dtvn2w6	1	*	Are you blind?
t1_dtvxksb	0	*	That's true; livestock can most certainly be kept ethically. But as you said, that's almost never the case in practice, which is what I was getting at.
t1_dtvj6pr	0	*	Animals go extinct because we drive them out and destroy their habitat, not because we dont hunt them. 
t1_dtvdw4a	0	*	Canned hunting means you don't have to track the animal - but do you have evidence to show they kill any lion they see?
t1_dtvn5q1	0	*	Stop spamming this.  We're not even talking about elephants in this case and your elephant copypasta is just nonsense in this context.   
t1_dtvwvzv	1	*	Lol, they made it an esport?  How is that structured?  I'm genuinely curious.
t1_dtvr7ho	0	*	So if they ate it afterwards you would have no problem? Because people do have problems with dogs being killed even if theyre eaten afterwards.
t1_dtvmd7n	1	*	Denied due to the apparent danger of writing about suicide. Unfortunate. 
t1_dtvdgo2	1	*	We don't know what this guy was doing with the lions after he shot them from what the article says. Maybe he was going to eat them.
t1_dtvzqgt	0	*	Damn, now I want some puffin!
t1_dtvolii	1	*	I only read until the end of 4. The rest isn't really worth the time imo.

t1_dtzs5bw	1	*	Really?What is significant about a hunters love of the kill?What grand good does it achieve?How is is productive?Now apply same to taste of the meat.
t1_dtvdwdv	0	*	They're confined to a small enough area that a 75 year old man can shoot them one after the other without either one getting away. Same same.
t1_ds3bvhh	0	*	Well, you are the one who quoted a dictionary entry to prove your point. I don't do junior highschool debate on reddit.
t1_ds3v7bm	0	*	Nay. I just have no idea what is going on inside your little mind, which you call 'reality'. In your reality, Trump is probably your hero, Roy Moore is a upright Republican etc...
t1_dtbd3vu	0	*	I was hoping for more but when he starting reiterating carbon lover I started losing it. 
t1_duw2bfx	1	*	Ontario, Canada!
t1_duwpndu	1	*	Yes it does... I put food-soiled paper in the compost all the time, since that is one of the main recommended materials to put in it. Where do you live that you didn't know that?
t1_duw2f5k	0	*	Yeah, how much does that cost?
t1_duvimlv	0	*	Is this something you can source? Or is this a generic places?
t1_duvvihx	0	*	Because if they didn't tell their customers and they changed it the McDonald's masses would be in an uproar
t1_duvbihj	0	*	I have been to an Indonesian city a couple of times over past 2 years, that would be a hopeless cause because you wont make a change, it's the people there who have to change.
t1_duvag3c	0	*	Hell yeah. I recommend checking it out. I always enjoy VICE docs
t1_duvd8uf	1	*	Glass is just sand reformed into a solid crystal. At best broken glass is sharp for like 10 years tops, after that it's just a pretty smooth stone like nearly any other.
t1_duva568	1	*	Somebody is carefully placing shit and toilet paper on the lines around East Anglia if you're right.
t1_duv6vt2	1	*	It's alright. I have already informed the appropriate parties. 
t1_duwv6fb	1	*	The McDonalds around me (southern Ontario, Canada) haven't used foam in years. All of their packaging is paper and cardboard. The only thing plastic is the straws.
t1_dsvbjlg	0	*	You're very good at not getting the point. Have you considered applying to play for the Buffalo Bills?
t1_du8rgup	0	*	The burden of proof is on you.
t1_dshjx2i	0	*	Probably because some refuse to admit that the 1950s was only glorious for a white, middle/upperclass men and even then that is very debatable.....
t1_dshvrcy	1	*	If one incident is all it takes, then the US, Canada, England etc are all as you described.
t1_dtiacfw	0	*	Except the deductions that corporations receive in America already made the corporate tax null and void. 
t1_durjom6	0	*	Yes, if he can live with the knowledge that he is a dishonest thief and the people around him don't finally realize what he's done. I'm done with this pointless conversation. You can't hear me.
t1_dsl2yc2	1	*	How many?
t1_dsl3sz8	1	*	Delusional is not an insult, it's a statement of fact.

t1_dsdrua8	0	*	Thanks friend! I'm actually working on them in duolingo right now, too!
t1_dunsazw	1	*	Great counter point. Japan was just something that came to mind immediately as an American trade partner in a region where were not entirely desirable. South Korea is a much better comparison. 
t1_dunl59q	1	*	In our society free press is seemingly dead, but authoritarian dictatorships didn't kill it.

t1_duoatth	1	*	Talk to any gay people?
t1_dunnocr	0	*	Nah, lets hope they are.
t1_dunnmtl	1	*	Well that was largely because minority groups were silenced/ignored. Most minorities don't think the past was good for them, but many white guys do.
t1_dunkx5f	0	*	Do you have a source for the fact that innocent people are being held there?
t1_dunwzng	1	*	Right. And its gonnna require an ammendment. Theyre trying to change the constitution! The founding fathers didnt want this kind of system! We cant even get rid of the electoral college.
t1_dunmgeo	0	*	Literally everything they do lmao

t1_dunpce3	1	*	Buzz feed? 
t1_dunv7y7	0	*	Right the Democrats are the side with the weaker, even if nearly always better, convictions. Unfortunately having too many moderates when negotiating with madmen hasn't seemed to work out very well.
t1_duntm4d	1	*	This. Nobody is going to oppress the guy saying I love apple pie and moms!  It's the offensive, unpopular, controversial speech that needs the most protection.

t1_dtv51kj	0	*	That's a childish position. When the missiles hit the carrier groups, then it's already too late.
t1_dtz4ykb	1	*	It wasn't, but that's a separate problem regarding Congress effectively surrendering its power to declare war.
t1_du2wupn	1	*	Why your post is so downvoted?

t1_duy1s8n	0	*	People who aren't angry are going to be less biased so yes.
t1_du2s43g	0	*	Oh come on. Sure, the fascists are the bad ones, but it's ridiculous to assume not a single self-proclaimed anti-fascist has assaulted an innocent person.
t1_du2kqqc	1	*	well, the masses either own the means of production or a small minority owns  them while the rest work for a wage, there is not much room in between.

t1_dttixpj	1	*	It would cost much less than that for private cover,  I might have extra money to give to charity then too.
t1_dtuaxah	0	*	Why should *anyone* believe you in that case? The right makes up plenty of bullshit about NHS death panels and wait times using that logic that they heard it from an offhand source.

t1_dtu19en	1	*	Dam, definitely wouldnt give up my universal healthcare after seeing those numbers!

t1_dsh4zjv	1	*	The irony of course is that Millennials were able to kill everything that previously made the country happy but were unable to kill the President that made everyone miserable.  -Senator Palpatine

t1_dsh2i26	0	*	The minimum wage increase was voted on by the same people who are now outraged by the effects of the minimum wage increase, eh? Guess the looneys dont fall from heaven.

t1_dsgssc3	1	*	They refuse to look at the bigger picture because their heads would explode. 
t1_dshcpkz	1	*	Because they spread on one side and slap it together like cream cheese sandwich. If I made $15/hr half assing my whole job, I never would have broke my ass in construction.

t1_dshf0tf	1	*	Yup. Pretty much what I said.

t1_dsrnm4s	1	*	He reminds me of some of the racist guys who Id run in when I was at university in the bumfuck South. They would say racist things to me in private because they thought Id get a kick out of it. 
t1_dsfku2d	0	*	Imo you're right and also very graciously explained, but looks like he just doesn't want to hear it. Might as well leave him be

t1_dsm2pi7	1	*	I've been to Florida, it's an uninteresting topic. We just met, don't be a dick, talk to me about something interesting
t1_dslxf6l	1	*	Or if you know what the majority of your heritage is likely to be, why not go with that? I don't understand why I would default to only the men in my family.

t1_dslx0w0	1	*	No, we're actually all from America.  Because we were all born in this country.   Why is it so hard to say, what ethnicity are you?

t1_dslx05k	0	*	... no? He's the incumbent and he has a proven voting base. That already makes him the assumed winner. Am I not being detailed enough...? I want to help you understand, here.
t1_dslxpw5	0	*	I guess that would technically mean nobody could really ever 'invade' subsaharan Africa because it's basically then just a civil war for control of their ancestral home.

t1_dsm5t5c	1	*	>you won't see ninjas fall  Ftfy

t1_dsm1m41	1	*	Oh yes. This is my new answer. Thank you, you clever bastard. 
t1_dsm16dv	1	*	Yeah I get that, Im just saying ethnicity would be a more accurate word to use than race
t1_dslvhhy	1	*	I have to agree with this. We say stupid things but we mean something totally different.    Source : am white people 
t1_dsm2t3r	1	*	Yeah, that would be like bringing up Project for a New American Century and the basically step by step plan that was followed by W.

t1_dt1wjto	0	*	A tax on everyone whose last name is Reagan.. hmm..
t1_dt2aei1	0	*	Im stealing the Liberty bell whos with me?
t1_dt1o1bt	1	*	That would actually be great if we didnt have two giant, collusive, deeply corrupt organizations controlling the whole business.
t1_dt1e0cl	0	*	Just like every other government of China previous to it
t1_dt1d7hd	0	*	I agree but at the same time the one making the claim should provide the sauce. 
t1_dt1vcg2	0	*	Ah, you're a troll. Ahaha, well played. I thought you were legit this stupid.    Thanks for the chuckle, dude.
t1_dt1icoe	0	*	> because the people don't even elect him.  Because you didn't vote for him doesn't mean the people didn't elect him.
t1_dt1cueo	1	*	There are some opinions that a usually only held by the ignorant. Education changes that

t1_dt1ci7a	1	*	Now bring me that horizon 
t1_dt1o59f	1	*	Yep! USAA as well! Seems like the best bet for now unless they fix it before the next pay period. 
t1_dt1kkwc	1	*	Young people see change as progress, wise men find quality progress in the trenches where it moves at a tortoises pace. 
t1_dt1e7n9	0	*	It's understandable. It is rather misleading.

t1_dt1rdza	0	*	How do you think making laws in other parliamentary systems differs?
t1_dt1e62f	0	*	Keep your cultural relativism horseshit in your sociology papers. Comparing Mao to Washington just makes you look like an idiot. 
t1_dt1t1de	1	*	Calling would cost you literally nothing.
t1_dt1frub	1	*	Like in many democratic South American and African countries?
t1_dt1of6z	1	*	My point is that 'the process' is whatever the CCP says it is, and can change at any time.
t1_dt1of6e	1	*	wtf dude
t1_dt1v32m	1	*	Good thing all their bills will be on hold the whole time too! And I'm sure grocery stores will just give them food and household supplies for free once they explain the situation. /s
t1_dt1ipsf	1	*	No.  I'm darn sure Congress likes to be paid.

t1_dt28lew	1	*	Sure let's go back a year and see who still has slaves.
t1_dt1yrlm	1	*	Likewise the Chinese communist party is flexible enough to literally embrace free market capitalism to the point where they believe in free trade more than the freaking US does. 
t1_dt1cdrd	1	*	To be fair, so would MLK.
t1_dt1k3w1	0	*	Ah, I'm sure there are some regional discrepancies. 
t1_dt1fcpy	1	*	Yes, we can. It doesn't make a difference, sadly. The government doesn't care :)
t1_dt355f2	1	*	Go protest somewhere where no one can see or hear them

t1_dt1nxuh	1	*	And so u/PabuIsTheAvatar was never heard from ever again
t1_dt1mhig	1	*	Tianamen Square. You can accept it happened without accepting exaggeration and propaganda. It's not like the CCP has shown even an inkling of sympathy for democratic movements since that time.
t1_dt1cbrx	1	*	In broad strokes: Good, with a side of this shit again?
t1_dt1blfg	1	*	i don't remember when they went away but they did replace the toys with hard candy before they disappeared but it wasn't good enough for who made the ban. but seems to have been changed recently.

t1_dt1qvm7	1	*	I fucking cannot wait for this season!!!!
t1_dt1iyqu	1	*	You fucked up by asking them directly to back up their statement lol 
t1_dt1eiqy	0	*	Because neither you, nor Errtai capitalized it either. You insisted on pedantry to get your point across, but couldn't be bothered to follow your own standards. 
t1_dv2hnb4	1	*	I'm guessing it's not mass but rather constant upward motion that's causing gravity.... which still requires some mass to... nvm
t1_dv29p6b	1	*	You are clearly in this 2%. 
t1_dv28x5q	1	*	His logic was absolutely sound. You on the other hand.. just came in willy nilly and threw ignorant statements around. Turn around.
t1_dv27rxb	1	*	It's not tariff it's it's applied to every product, including those made inside the country.  And VAT is applied to every product. So not tariff, just a regular tax.
t1_dv2aikn	1	*	Ya.. it happens sometimes. 
t1_dv2bbog	1	*	Foreign powers making it IN the US electorate's interests to vote for a candidate, is not the same as foreign powers manipulating the electorate so they vote AGAINST their own interests.
t1_dsyhb0x	1	*	No, it's with a  instead of a .   Edit: great, getting downvoted because they guy edits his comment to be correct
t1_dsyuau5	0	*	Do you know what the difference between establishing a residence and establishing a domicile is? 
t1_dsyl54i	1	*	I belive the spirit of this is 'if they were jewish enough for the germans to kill them, they can come', not the exact religious definition.
t1_dsybo1l	0	*	By the standard, every ethnic cleansing was done legally too.
t1_dsv970z	1	*	Yeah i'm sure you can prove your valor over internet message boards. 
t1_ds6kan8	0	*	Did Germany resettle 1 refugee?  No.  Then why do you keep clinging to this hypothetical case?
t1_dumulvv	0	*	Maybe. I can't speak on how many of them are dog shit, but I know for me locally the University of San Francisco has that reputation. It's partly why they call it the University of Spoiled Foreigners.

t1_dte2epp	1	*	I don't think you understand how hard it would be to nationalize a major company in the US today.  It would not be a simple matter of an Executive Order nor an Act of Congress.
t1_dteow3f	1	*	It was forseen though. 
t1_du9lhts	1	*	> suddenly Arab countries  how were these arab countries established?

t1_dto7wqp	0	*	Sorry, not a native speaker 
t1_dso958g	0	*	That is not true at all.  This forces the merchants to find the cheapest costs.  If you don't want to pay the cost associated with taking credit cards then don't take credit cards.  
t1_dsns7cl	1	*	Everything is more expensive for small business.
t1_dsnonzc	1	*	Yeah, its called Brinks

t1_du2bmlf	1	*	Truth
t1_du1yr6r	0	*	We both know this is a fundamentally different issue. But if you think we should just send pamphlets telling the NK people to go and fuck themselves we can go that route also.

t1_du8q2r7	1	*	There are like, orders of magnitude more bullshit YouTube videos of people giving their opinions like yours than there are peer reviewed studies.

t1_durvnqb	0	*	Ironic then that you don't see how your attitude is exactly the same as the colonialists.
t1_dt3eoji	0	*	Italy and Britain both colonized parts of Somalia. That doesn't mean the US has had nothing to do with Somalia since then. It also doesn't mean the Somalis don't have any blame.
t1_dsq2zrz	1	*	You need a place with low light pollution and clear sky. They found a good sight there. They used to put it up in the mountainy bits of italy, but even that is to light polluted now.
t1_dt3bhm4	0	*	After 50+ years of occupation ofcourse there is quite alot of resentment and hatred, you do not govern through an opinion poll.

t1_dt0te9h	1	*	Yeah, too bad that he doesn't have the power to stand up to his warheouse managers. If only he owned the company or something, maybe he could do something.... Oh wait, he *does* own the company.  
t1_dt2k91z	0	*	But millions can. Ironic that you profit directly from the companies you despise so much.

t1_dsahp20	0	*	I was 1 in 1994. I'll definitely be researching it 
t1_dud4hao	1	*	I don't disagree, but during the primary peak, they were getting to the frontpage very regularly
t1_dut3gpm	0	*	Yes cause solutions to problems are bad
t1_ds8s17w	1	*	I only read 2/3 of every article on Reddit though
t1_ds8b3nj	1	*	Yeah... that is not exactly conducive to a healthy economy... or to spur innovation. 
t1_ds8uvho	0	*	Please prove it. 
t1_ds8pcod	0	*	I don't care either, but making it at home is actually easier and cheaper. Tastes better too. Better than Timmy Ho's brown diarrhea water. 
t1_ds8aob7	0	*	so... helping the poor by bankrupting the businesses they work at?
t1_ds9vwlx	0	*	> In comparison to the rest of Canada and the US, Ontario had a pretty high minimum wage, actually.  What was the your point with that statement?
t1_ds9crxb	1	*	Yes.
t1_ds8iu82	0	*	You say you can prove it, so prove it. 
t1_dthb73h	0	*	Man to many vines have turned your ability to see nuance to shit
t1_dti5fl7	0	*	Thats only if you believe the content kids are viewing online is brainwashing them lmfao
t1_dtd6tt9	1	*	When considering all the options, being environmentally clean is still the chear**er** option. That just involves considering a longer term view than the next quarter.
t1_dtd1oi1	0	*	Black Licorice Melt?
t1_dtd0eu1	1	*	Saddening to see people like yourself convince themselves that obviously false things are true. 
t1_dtd0wvx	1	*	Like all Trump's speeches, then. 
t1_dtd4e0u	1	*	OMG! I can't stop laughing! 
t1_dtd0j8a	1	*	I wasn't expecting the inquisition to be a part of this discussion
t1_dtcx1ig	1	*	Maybe you need fewer words and more pictures. Make sure to mention his username a lot too.
t1_dtd26hf	0	*	Who's voting for them, though.
t1_dtdodh1	0	*	We were still contributing to the accord though, it doesnt matter. We were paying, they were not. End of story. They also have higher carbon emissions.
t1_dtd2ey5	0	*	Ah, I completely agree. ^^ Some people present it the other way around, like it means they didn't have anything to do with the outcome.. Could never understand that logic.
t1_dtdjlc2	1	*	The Trump speech reminded me of citizen Kane.
t1_dtdodx7	1	*	How the hell did you leap from money to racism? Those two things aren't even tangentially related.
t1_dtd1422	0	*	Migrating into the empty inner cities for Americans, I think Europe will have the worst of it, but it'll be more expensive than apocalyptic, IMO. 
t1_dtd563l	1	*	If he didn't then, he does now.
t1_dtdo155	0	*	Why don't they lobby the Dems for the same thing, though? Or, if they do, why isn't their lobbying *successful*?

t1_dtey4b2	0	*	gets given evidence... runs away calling FAKE NEWS.... we got one away from his safe space guys!
t1_dtdcelj	1	*	Boom, roasted
t1_dtd5hqk	1	*	...do you mean off the cuff?  Given the topic, I really can't tell if that was intentional or not.
t1_dtczuel	1	*	They probably aren't all that anti-science. It's just that environmental protections fuck with their profit margins because they can't just dump their waste on small villages.
t1_dtcyqtz	1	*	They are low balling over there
t1_dtcz4iy	1	*	Yes, that is what cold is.
t1_dtd0dgi	1	*	>That should tell you all you need to know about the American people.  FTFY
t1_dtd37ak	1	*	Nice one. Love it when people compare shit to genocides. 
t1_dtdlygn	0	*	In the US, only votes cast matter. Protesting all choices by not voting, is effectively a vote for your least favorite
t1_dtdo9pd	1	*	That doesn't explain the stark split between Dems and the GOP on this, though. Both of them are pro-business.
t1_dsic8mx	0	*	So you prefer Trump? Cause the guy you replied to said he preferred Hillary over Trump.
t1_dsqx45x	1	*	In the same way that removing your appendix just in case of appendicitis many years down the road is. Or cutting off your eyelids so you dont get eye crust.
t1_dstf10u	0	*	You don't read the comments? 
t1_dsqpgvj	0	*	If that's how you see it :)
t1_dupwdyx	0	*	>You say you want to escalate a conflict with russia because of their land annexations,      What, where did I say that? I haven't said that the US should or shouldn't start a war.
t1_dtvinrt	0	*	Carlsberg is Danish, but not a good (or bad) beer. We have many more that are better but you wouldnt know them. 
t1_dt8mvn5	1	*	Heh, fair enough. Ya never know on the internet. Cheers :D
t1_dt9nuly	0	*	It doesn't matter in this context
t1_dt8uiv6	0	*	Yes, but it appears that feminism is for equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.  The former requires tyranny - the latter only fairness.
t1_dt9fuh7	1	*	This is why Jews are liked in China
t1_dt8ufhh	0	*	Because they study more? Anecdotal but when I was in school the girls studied while the guys were playing around
t1_dt9qw0z	0	*	Could be? I asked for evidence and you reply with what you think with no basis yet again?  Your points aren't even relevant to the subject of why male applicants would decrease in this system.
t1_dt95siq	0	*	Women in the UK get better grades in primary, secondary, and sixth form education. Maybe the male candidates were just worse. :)
t1_dt8tx3v	0	*	No, men in the past got their benefits. Were not men in the past. 
t1_dt970ic	0	*	Hoe is giving women more time to do exams equality? Don't you get that that's literally the exact opposite of equality?
t1_duoh52g	0	*	Is a Bach the child or predator?

t1_dui94z1	1	*	Cya pussy asshole.  Duh
t1_dui9znx	1	*	You're an idiot who's completely missing the point on purpose. 
t1_dui7h69	0	*	Whatever they told you, man.
t1_dui8h78	1	*	And the croissant?
t1_duiabnh	1	*	And more forget - that job in downtown NYC is not available in rural Kentucky, so moving isn't really an option.
t1_dui9jfr	1	*	How much of the infrastructure do they use?
t1_duiayhf	1	*	I mean there's tonnes people employees that are filthy rich. Banker, lawyers, etc. Like Blackstone alone has made like 4 employees billionaires..
t1_duibfd2	0	*	You think 250,000 and 180,000 is doing big things. I'm face palming in real life. That's literally the cost of a yearly golf membership for the wealthy.
t1_duirm42	0	*	Yeah because there is such a long list of other politicians who walked with MLK, participated in segregation protests, and stood up for LGBT rights in the 80s-present right?
t1_duifou1	0	*	Ah, the fabled job creators?  Who now apparently take care of their workers because reasons?
t1_dumkxad	1	*	These people are shit! They really look at things completely based on numbers. Like everything was terrible before we got Windows right!?
t1_dui8v2m	1	*	I stand for the Republic, for Democracy!
t1_dui9aen	1	*	No, but that's not what we're talking about
t1_duic6zh	1	*	That would certainly kick the can down the road a few steps.
t1_duj3dd2	1	*	quite the vapid thought in progress. 
t1_duie8rl	0	*	Not in absolute dollar amounts 
t1_dui9f1x	0	*	As well they should be. SS is a poverty prevention program, not a retirement account. You have access to 401k contributions or similar vehicles for that (not to mention standard taxable accounts).
t1_duiaams	1	*	It can be a lot of money, if youre not paying off the student loans and other debt that got you there. A family with substantial student loan debt doesnt necessarily feel that 150k. 
t1_dui8lfk	1	*	Mark Cuban semi-good guy.  Because he shit talk trump. Lol
t1_duin9li	0	*	That is actually literally what whataboutism is you skidmark
t1_dui7sz0	1	*	Neither
t1_duiac9t	0	*	Nope.  A tax bracket refers to a range of incomes subject to a certain income tax rate.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp
t1_duiarjc	0	*	Keep in mind the school loans and debt accumulated to get a job where you make 150k . Our society has internal limitations to acquiring wealth unless you come from wealth. 
t1_dui8g3z	1	*	Hahahahahaha
t1_duigmhu	1	*	West Jersey isn't Jersey, doesn't count.
t1_duihit9	1	*	If you have $200+k in student loans you should be a doctor and will be making well over $150k pretty quickly 
t1_duiamxp	0	*	I mainly agree. My wages have stood still for 10 years (UK civil servant) but my mates are doing great. The rare occasion we go on a bender, they sort me out.
t1_duikoni	1	*	I'm sorry I'm just not going to feel anywhere near the sorrow for people bringing in that much money compared to people living in complete and utter disparity. 
t1_dui9ayd	0	*	But Zuckerberg wants to give free ~~Internet~~Facebook-only connectivity to the developing world. He's just a great guy!
t1_duic0no	0	*	That's what vehicle registration fees go towards I thought? That's why you pay more for registration on a big truck than you will a sedan, even if they cost the same amount.
t1_dui9l69	1	*	Most Americans in all brackets live beyond their means honestly. I struggle not to do so myself, although I am certainly lower income.
t1_dui88ku	0	*	The part where society is a bunch of people talking about what they want, not what YOU IN PARTICULAR WANT     If you don't like it, LEAVE SOCIETY checkmate
t1_dui7fzd	1	*	Only shooting?!?! Must be a deep state agent for Hillary /s
t1_duzeu6l	0	*	To say the US went to shit is a little ridiculous. The US was doing very well in the 90's. It may currently be going to shit, but we were rocking and rolling in the 80's and 90's
t1_dv3k87b	0	*	Did you ask What are you trying to say?
t1_duzd8xx	0	*	> assuming the amount of cars stays the same.  You didn't read this part of my comment, did you?
t1_duz9cdy	0	*	internet wasn't really an invention its a collective thing. first gps was during the 70s
t1_duzc3h7	1	*	that's great! exactly what I am talking about.  I lived in Florida, would have definitely used that Miami-Orlando line a couple of times.
t1_duzc2oz	1	*	22 years old isn't exactly old, especially for an airport. Look at how old Laguardia (what the original poster linked) is. 
t1_duzaphi	1	*	you are right! The thing where if the women dont find you handsome they can at least find you handy!
t1_duz589e	0	*	Just confused.
t1_duzgx4w	0	*	Right that's why I said DC-Boston, one of the areas in the US that rivals Europe in density

t1_dts8qtg	0	*	Won't engage with what point?  I replied because your comment was vague.
t1_du87dw8	1	*	no, the check came from the American people. So lets summarise, Obama signed the legislation, the American people payed for it. 
t1_dtu9a41	1	*	To the private contractors hired to do the job.
t1_du332hz	1	*	You should really educate yourself before lecturing someone else on his knowledge.  Read and come back : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2011)
t1_dteqta1	1	*	Wow, that was a great read.
t1_dtelf5h	0	*	Some do, others such as small pox, death by small wound and leprosy have been minimised. You tackle the smaller, easy to recognise problems first, and we're starting to move towards global ones now.
t1_dteu830	0	*	we have been in the age of humans for a while.... this is the result of it. if anything is going to be our destruction, very high chance its going to be ourselfs.

t1_dtelyff	1	*	No man is an island
t1_dtf4hh5	0	*	 Did they, though?  How sure are they that there are no confounding variables?
t1_dtergqt	1	*	Except you don't use tanks to fight climate change, so that doesn't help the Pentagon budget 
t1_dten574	1	*	Slight quibble. Wasn't Easter Island's [population collapse](https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/new-evidence-easter-island-civilization-was-not-destroyed-by-war/) proven to be a myth?
t1_dteqp9q	0	*	Oh, wow. 2014? You'd think we'd know the effects of breathing in dielsel engine fumes by now. What the fuck did they expect? 
t1_dtemui7	1	*	Literally tens of billions of points of pollution and economies/industries which facilitate a speedier downfall of our climate and oceans... but ROCKS can save us.   
t1_du7rtq6	1	*	You seem lost.

t1_dsi81hn	1	*	TD is far more hateful than most groups on Reddit.

t1_dsfrwge	0	*	Thems fightin words.
t1_dsil5nj	0	*	Yes an obligation to accept diversity. This is not Kabul. Not an obligation to eat pork like we live in some sort of a fundamentalist pork cult. Is this stuff really so difficult?
t1_dsglzr8	1	*	Fish is not that expensive. Not here, anyway. Depends on the fish but I doubt even monkfish or turbot are that pricey. 
t1_dtfuv8j	0	*	I havent tried any yet but I cant wait to!
t1_dtcu3es	0	*	Mutton is considered red meat. Either way, I commend you on your diet.
t1_dtcuj1l	1	*	That's at least a real animal.
t1_dtcpq7x	0	*	Not going to hell, but you're ruining the earth and causing thousands of animals to suffer in poor conditions and be slaughtered for your enjoyment over your lifetime. 
t1_dtcv8wy	0	*	Do you like Rick and Morty? 
t1_dtcvp7o	0	*	Wow those are some really vague problems to act like there's no solution to that we'll find in the next 100 years, and to think would be completely world changing.
t1_dtd111h	0	*	Diabetes and heart disease are not caused by animal products; it's the combination of large quantities of highly processed sugars and carbs.  Furthermore, humans are omnivores, not herbivores.
t1_dtcscri	1	*	Excellent post. Permaculture is the path to the renewing our planet.

t1_dtcw424	1	*	It was just a guess.
t1_dtd1jre	1	*	So is Russia.
t1_dtcodnn	1	*	Very true. It can feel hopeless sometimes though! But meat is bad on SO many levels.
t1_dtd7fd8	1	*	Basically that chart took he amount of meat produced in a country and then divided it equally among the people who live in that country.
t1_dtcq25z	0	*	I don't think that's an accurate analogy. We've been eating meat since we've existed. Cars are a created thing and it's just as easy to buy a different car. We aren't inclined to drive certain cars.
t1_dtcll25	0	*	The majority are morons, that's why we're doomed.

t1_dt1sudt	0	*	Would they know who struck if this weapon hit, or does second strike just assume a target?
t1_dt1wgh6	1	*	It can be preprogrammed for exapmple to wait for a week and then slowly go to it's target. And hit enemy when he think that he's already won.
t1_dt1qf68	0	*	Wasn't the reason that angle was dropped is because studio execs thought the general audience was too dumb to understand the concept of cloud computing?
t1_dt1trre	1	*	So why is it news if everyone had these already? Its so hard trying to figure these articles out based solely on context from the comments.
t1_du8sxgj	0	*	Everyone lives in peace happily ever after.   Who gives a shit what happens after Assad? He needs to die. End of story
t1_dslmkb9	1	*	Hate to burst your first-year-in-college-level socialist fantasy, but you sound like you have never taken care of anything yourself in your life.  If you have, you should feel even more ashamed.
t1_dsm7e6q	0	*	 Oh yeah definitely wasn't because of his radical communist political beliefs. Just simply because of his skin Hue. Got it
t1_dsmai86	0	*	You did say he was a trade off though. So you conceded he was bad but he traded well. If you're now saying that you're not getting much out of him, then where's the trade off? 
t1_dsld7yf	1	*	He is an angry child
t1_dsl45eo	1	*	I support their efforts to offend and make Nazis cry.

t1_dt2eynt	1	*	I didn't say anything in the above thread besides my explanation of the term. That person said the concept is scary for the US and Canada because they might be more loyal to China. 
t1_duwwkzb	1	*	I don't see how you think we don't have that.. when we know we do
t1_duvn3gl	1	*	Not really, I don't see any other country being subjected to that much propaganda. Reporting on other countries is more factual. Turkey somewhat, but to a much lesser extent.
t1_duq6p5g	1	*	Agreed.
t1_duq483q	0	*	South Africa hasn't seized land from farmers on a large scale, and won't do that.

t1_du34w2r	0	*	All the ones who are still allowed to compete but not under the official Russian flag were found clean iirc.
t1_du3280b	1	*	Ironically the mutations that make them natural freaks are often just the body producing its own excess steroids or blood cells. Maybe doping in the future will involve gene editing.
t1_ds70a1g	0	*	Well done buying into the sports team mentality that plagues politics.  
t1_ds6ee41	0	*	Is that why the EU has done what the people want? We don't want them forcing bills on us. If it keeps doing that it's not representative of us.
t1_ds7uqx4	0	*	> Keep referenduming, until we can establish a pattern. Best of three doesn't actually sound that bad when the margin is this thin.  That's not how democracy fucking works holy shit

t1_dtsmd9i	0	*	the income tax is 5.1.  ut here is what they take  Social security Fed Medicare MA Tax  all of that adds up to roughly 25% of your total paycheck. 
t1_dtsmtpv	1	*	sure. but why knock down the poor even more. the system isn't leveled across the board? what risk does the rich have after getting rich? none. 
t1_ds8hlrg	1	*	They still don't hold the shares though, and the shares are still privately owned, so it's capitalist. I still think it's a great move though. 
t1_ds7w1ez	0	*	Theoretically yes, in the same way that an alcoholic could theoretically only drink a single beer in a six-pack, but someone that are willing to do it once, might do it again.
t1_ds8ak25	1	*	Thanks to you capitalism gods, you can't seem to get the mental health aid you so desperately are in need of because holy fucking shit the start of your second paragraph is frighteningly mental.

t1_ds6d2f0	0	*	Good point. I don't really think the payments should have to be equal in order for your house to be razed though. But that's just me. 
t1_duz6roz	0	*	That is most definitely not facism.  I believe you are referring to corporate oligarchy or corporatocracy.

t1_dupdf0m	1	*	And the good replies said that 3.5g is a huge line, even for a shitty product. For a good product, 0.5g would be enough. This one was really high purity, so...

t1_dtp2w7l	1	*	You assume that a pilot that just ejected from a burning plane is ready or capable of fighting. This Russian pilot shows just how wrong that assumption can be. 
t1_dtput9s	0	*	How is it irrelevant? The law applies to everyone it doesn't matter if they're been taught it or not. I guess that means i can go murder someone and then claim I didn't know murder was illegal, right?
t1_dtpl8zo	1	*	War crimes only apply to the losers.
t1_dtp1abq	0	*	While I agree with you, it's pretty common for countries to lie about how many losses they have in a fight, I guess for morale.
t1_dtpiknm	1	*	popadop plead guilty, and I think we can both agree that our state should be listening into russian agent's phone calls.

t1_dtml8wq	1	*	That doesn't negate anything I've mentioned, since those countries have bilateral economic and military relationships with the US, and have territorial and political problems with China.
t1_dtmisax	1	*	You are justifying irrational hatred. Justifying irrational anything kind of shows how bat-shit crazy a person is. Perhaps you should reconsider some of your emotions.

t1_dusts70	0	*	Are you talking to me?
t1_duudc6p	1	*	And adjusting for per capita makes no sense because that does very little to sway international trade. Kinda thought people browsing worldnews would generally look at the big picture but ok.
t1_dusk8cv	1	*	I never said it was a mental health issue. Blowing up school buses is doable but it wouldn't produce the same fame which is kind of a big reason for doing it.

t1_dutlwnv	0	*	The point is you've made it clear you plan to discredit any source I would give you, as I would probably do the same for you. Honestly not worth the trouble.

t1_dsgou2r	0	*	the key is the low barrier to entry in the epipen case.  it's way harder to start a telecom company than to start manufacturing epi-pens.
t1_dsghugl	1	*	So are you mad at Trump for doing this? You post on The_Shitpost and only the most devout are allowed to stay there. Will seeing this change your mind? 
t1_dsgi7bx	1	*	Yeah but they could at least say they were better than blacks or women. Now they're having to face the fact that they're garbage to the rich too and they don't like it. 
t1_dsgxs51	0	*	Stop automatically saying all politicians lie constantly.  No normal person would ever want to run for office in that environment.
t1_dsgg3ke	1	*	You poor poor child. Humans don't work that way. Try all you want and it will never work. Do you post on r/communism or some shit?

t1_dulfxt6	0	*	Lol. So because his experience does not aliegn with what you think is true means it must be an exception??
t1_dulocr0	0	*	what is the non-religious framework? I think you're underestimating how much the west operates inside a Judeo Christian framework 
t1_dulfq4g	1	*	Why is that?
t1_dum6xgp	0	*	That it shouldn't be taught that anti-abortion is a core tenant of Christianity is so obvious that I feel any discussion with you is completely meaningless.

t1_dv2mrbg	1	*	What nepotism exists at the same level as the trump administration? 
t1_dv2woyd	1	*	It was just colonies of Euro empires. But Canada in a way has remained a dominion of the British, even after 1867.

t1_dsw8knx	0	*	Can you make that sound during a race to make other horses stop and pee?
t1_dsvxhsg	1	*	Yes they are, but I specifically replied to the comment above that discusses refusing testing. That is a different thing than dropping out, as you would say.
t1_dseord2	1	*	On that note, can americans stop using the imperial system? 
t1_dugcsri	0	*	> Surely it'd be better to just refuse to compete against them though  Can't do that in tournaments. You do it or you do not, you can not pick and choose who you are up against.

t1_dse0xof	0	*	So the guy in the video didnt work for the NYT and didnt say what he said? Does 'attack the messenger' not present as a logical fallacy in your reality? 
t1_dsdq8jj	0	*	Mass murder is worse than serial killer is it not?
t1_dsegcmg	0	*	Capitalism rewards profit seeking in any form by anyone. Why wouldn't state officials being corrupt be the fault of capitalism? The state is necessary for upholding capitalism so both are intertwined.

t1_dsdnfp2	0	*	That name being ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council.
t1_dsew2be	1	*	But superdelegates are worth more votes each right?   The whole DNC/RNC is hopelessly corrupt and a thorn in side of representative democracy. Not trying to seem pro superdelegates
t1_dse2cy4	1	*	~9.* Bill was in office until 1/20/2001. 
t1_dsdxol1	0	*	That's true it's when you *choose* one over the other when both are wrong that their is implicit acceptance, just the existence doesn't make it true. Fair enough!
t1_dsdjvts	0	*	Oh I see. It isn't really, but it doesn't directly involve Russia so I guess it doesn't suit the current narrative (not that it's any better).  
t1_dsdtndv	1	*	Totally.

t1_dsdn4r5	0	*	So your argument is Trump is a mastermind at hiding money and despite it looking like his networth is going down he's making billions more?
t1_dse2znk	1	*	True. Just thought it was noteworthy

t1_dt2hggr	0	*	They dont, now you tell me how America justified it is okay to have school kids shot by assault rifles and daily mass shooting is okay. Did you forget the recent leaked cia document about torture? 
t1_dt3ggl2	0	*	I'm not one to usually claim moral high ground but there's no excuse for a government to slaughter peaceful demonstrators. Did what they had to? WTF is wrong with you?
t1_dsljpfi	1	*	And the dudes often die for other reasons where women don't, but don't let reality get in the way of your ignorance. 
t1_dtxd3cr	0	*	how dense are you? could a gang operate globally without being globalists? lay off the koolaid, kiddo. 
t1_du6cpit	1	*	I'm sure you could write a law that was based on distributing appropriate percentages of company profits and not absolute numbers, thus avoiding company bankruptcy. 
t1_du6vk7h	1	*	I think they're also forgetting that companies would rather hold on to an already trained employee that is used to the company culture than bring in an new employee...  That alone has cost savings.
t1_duoj3im	1	*	Because even if it's illegal, there'll still be some poachers. Like elephants.

t1_dtdim1s	0	*	Not hard to figure out, look at the polls
t1_dtdlxfr	0	*	 I'd imagine that part of his support is due to what often happens to his opposition. Navalny was jailed 3 times in 2017... that has what is called a chilling effect. 
t1_dten5na	1	*	*sigh* People that talk about us sacrificing good life do not understand, that for lot of us it is still better than what we had in the 90s. And we don't want to go back.

t1_dtdwikw	1	*	> does name a successor.  Dont need to name one. Just need to have one.  The consensus between people who understand politics in Russia is that it will be a no-name guy specifically groomed for this.

t1_dturjs0	1	*	You just have to be 18 to but cigarettes and 21 to buy alcohol. Every gas station cash register personel is 21 years old and has a license to sell liquor.

t1_duh64o1	0	*	My country has a points system, where driving violations cost you points as well as money.  Lose enough points, and you lose your right to drive for a good amount of time.
t1_dugcki3	1	*	If you want to see it in action check out the conversation I'm having in another thread.

t1_dstqng6	1	*	The ballistics can only hit the northern side of the city. Still bad, but eh
t1_dstqy6r	1	*	To be fair, Trump's comments were written in in Korean and Kim's were in English. It was a total bamboozle because in English, Kim's tweets read just like Trump's fuckery.
t1_dstxajm	1	*	its still an awful looking flag. and should they reunite. They could come up with something better.  also. the south korean flag has a white background no? so does this united flag.

t1_dt8k40f	1	*	I mean, we pay Cuba to lease Gitmo. If SK wanted us out and refused a lease, then us stubbornly staying would be an act of war. 
t1_dtxgjwr	1	*	Wow good write up
t1_dty6hje	1	*	It appears to be very easy for you to judge a 14 year old fearing for his very life. Must be nice to have a childhood safe and secure. Not everyone had that.

t1_ds9cvq2	1	*	Yea sure go ahead.

t1_dux3poa	1	*	If it's illegal EU-wide then it's illegal in Ireland too, due to the supremacy of EU law over national law, and also because EU law is incorporated into national law. It's really simple. 
t1_duyhot9	0	*	I'm not arguing that.  However, some people are clearly taking it farther.  Look, for example, at the people cajoled into building a cage and holding an anti-Clinton parade by Russian operatives.

t1_duzghzg	1	*	So start a war? 
t1_duzj6si	1	*	But these girls are white.  And from a country very close to Norway. Minks is almost as close to Oslo as Houston is to Atlanta.  So they are practically Norwegians and therefore must be accepted.

t1_dun6tea	0	*	Just make sure that cafeteria shuts before midnight
t1_dunpcc1	0	*	Yeah, that works. 'Begs' compiles but gives a nasty runtime exception when you do it on platforms that have native rhetoric support. 'Raises' is standards compliant and should work everywhere.

t1_dskz40d	1	*	Just what I meant was that it was a crosswalk where pedestrians didnt have the right of way or where cars would be obliged to stop at someone waiting at the curb.
t1_dskktlk	1	*	After the way he operated in Scotland, I would be surprised if anyone didn't think he was a cunt. Going back way before he even announced he would run they all knew he was a cunt.
t1_dskc22t	0	*	Cymru am byth
t1_dski8bk	1	*	I applied to work there three times and was never hired despite a law degree and an undergraduate degree in Russian and Chinese. Seeing the people they DO hire pisses me off to no end sometimes.
t1_dskgi86	0	*	Yeah we're not exactly thrilled about it ourselves.
t1_dskh9fn	0	*	Nobody knew Trump said that until late 2017, AFTER the election.

t1_dsn5rsq	1	*	From now on when I meet an American I'm gong to avoid Trump conversations. That sounds annoying as fuck. 
t1_dsnnf06	1	*	Id be lying if I didnt say it was kinda fucked up.
t1_dskmnnd	1	*	Thank you
t1_dskk08e	0	*	Id love for  a constitutional monarch to dissolve this government we have...:
t1_dsk8b3v	0	*	It does. Anyone with half a brain knows that 99% of what comes out of Trumps mouth about anything political is nothing but pure lies and filth.
t1_dskkvad	1	*	The US embassy in Canada looks like a bunker with the top blown off.
t1_dskcsp1	1	*	He probably will if the democrats can't produce a half decent candidate this time and manage to get their voters motivated.
t1_dskjehl	1	*	I'm betting Charles will be dead before she is, so it's King Willy next (God, did I just say that?)
t1_dskgz7e	1	*	You forgot the most important step - they then realise they cant pay the bank back and go bankrupt.

t1_dsk8yja	0	*	Those are actually owned by corporate america
t1_ds557sj	1	*	You have not refuted a thing. But let's repeat  1. C-14 is 99% sourced from Nitrogen 2. Increasing Co2 does not increase percentage of radioactivity.
t1_ds3xdd8	0	*	I am not wrong but please continue to assume the meaning behind my post to be something other than what I clearly already said.
t1_ds54nrh	1	*	Do you even know what those words mean? 
t1_ds51ize	0	*	Average taken in the same spot, and the same time of year.   Which would be more meaningful if you had a control subject - an identical planet that _DIDN'T_ have growing cities.

t1_ds3qvrg	0	*	How about this then?    https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/docs/Smith_Reynolds_2002.pdf
t1_dtpje0x	1	*	Also a nation can be capitalist without free markets. Look at what ISPs are trying to do in America. Lobbying local governments to legislate against competition. This kills the free market.
t1_dtbyryd	1	*	Wow, never would've guessed that. Anything I can do to increase awareness? 
t1_dtbtlsd	0	*	Earth is the filter I guess. 
t1_dtbzb5b	0	*	Careful on that edge
t1_dtbxita	1	*	Source?
t1_dtc0a0a	0	*	So what part of expressing sympathy is detrimental then?
t1_dtcuf6o	1	*	war/terrorism is a tribal action. Anything less than a family unit you could call a mere crime.  war/terrorism has a tribe, sect, caste, nation, company, church, etc. behind it.  yep
t1_dtbss1n	1	*	Then what was the point of your comment? Nice try crawling back tho, reddit loves it when someone says muh strawman 
t1_dtdj3no	0	*	People who start sentences with I hate are hate-able punch-able face types.

t1_dtbvcct	1	*	Makes sense And itll save US tax payer and American lives too
t1_dtbz3y5	0	*	You can start by not grouping all Americans and labeling an entire country.
t1_dtbznbt	0	*	So its only okay to use kids in war if its against the right people? I disagree.
t1_dtcfsi6	0	*	Saw it on Facebook first.
t1_dtclabo	1	*	Rather than saying WRONG to u/poop_flavored_pee multiple times, how do you even know that? 
t1_dtcaqcm	1	*	As an infantry vet, none of us need an engineers to help us out in combat. Maybe in some engineer related shit, but not when it comes to killing bad guys.
t1_dtc9xci	0	*	And ISIS lives in the middle East and the in the heart of certain USA politicians.
t1_dtc909h	1	*	Besides, there's plenty of times where American soldiers have killed Afghani civilians. No need to exaggerate on that front.
t1_dtbww0t	1	*	relax a bit, it was only tongue in cheek. Realised after its basically a paraphrased 'theonion' article anyway. 
t1_dtbxywt	1	*	lold hard at this one. Thank you for that because my blood pressure was going through the roof from reading the comments. 
t1_dtbyho5	0	*	It was mandatory on my school. 
t1_dtbyryl	0	*	You'd be surprised how many people dont get the memo

t1_dtbzpcr	0	*	Youre creating an argument of something that I'm not going to argue you with.
t1_dtc4mwr	1	*	When a place as left leaning and progressive as Reddit upvotes heaps of comments saying the poster feels less for the distant and different, it is not simple racism...
t1_dtbtz12	1	*	I dont know how you accidentally hit a hospital. They are supposed to have good intel on a region. You dont just miss your building completely 
t1_dtbwmni	0	*	And yet, the world would be better off if none of them had been born. Your giving a bit too much credit to humans in this response. Dont see why its any more sad than a tree getting cut down. 
t1_dtc97vr	0	*	All of this is second hand. He doesn't much like to talk about it. I can ask.
t1_dtc4wge	1	*	The whole series was very insightful.
t1_dtc5yae	1	*	The really shitty part is that with all those people you listed, they were most likely doing things they legitimately believed were for the benefit of their people. 
t1_dtbv7g7	0	*	What high expectations do I have?
t1_dtbv10v	0	*	Some were just soldiers just like ours. Black and white thinking is for children and the childish. 
t1_dtgra48	1	*	Absolutely. 
t1_dtbzlii	0	*	their point is to avoid the Us versus Them mentality. were all human. ISIS, the nazis, ted bundy; humans. all of us. all of them. you cant forget that.

t1_dtbtr78	0	*	Why not all three?
t1_dtbun33	1	*	wtf? I hadn't heard about 1, or my brain just disregards it now
t1_dtcii5x	1	*	Honestly I'm not a chemist, I've just never seen water burn someones skin so bad. I guess it was more for emphasis.

t1_dtoiw4e	0	*	They are both excellent at convincing rich, dumb people to hand over money.
t1_dtm5tzm	1	*	I thought that Fidel visited Canada some time before Justin was born?  I could be totally wrong about that though, I only hear about it from the jokes on Reddit.
t1_dtz0nl8	1	*	Shitposting, duh.
t1_dtzffhl	0	*	Yeah you've just revealed that you haven't bothered reading about this at all beyond the headline. No-one is talking about censoring individual legitimate news sources. Read up.
t1_dtz35hi	1	*	Sounds like a good call. Thanks!
t1_dtzmznv	1	*	You're clearly a functioning adult, so I'll leave you to your not-at-all-foamingly-biased opinion.
t1_dtz3b75	1	*	Its funny how humour works. Your cromulent objection embiggens the smallest people.
t1_dtz4eqh	1	*	I guess, if the ideology is just a front haha
t1_dtz2f2z	0	*	> oligopoly full of corrupt capitalists  That's not capitalism. The kernel of capitalism is property rights. Violation of property rights is not capitalism. That's cronyism.
t1_dtyu7yf	0	*	Justin Bieber! Us Canadians are arguably terrorists
t1_dtyybc4	0	*	Tide pods... it's consumers are going to be allowed to vote in the next federal election...  let that sink in
t1_dtz3oun	1	*	They also seem to completely reject the concept of self deprecating humour. As if Trudeau can't make fun of himself at the same time he's poking fun at lady mitochondria.
t1_dtz6t3q	1	*	I ***aggressively*** give you all of my platonic love and support!
t1_dtzahw7	0	*	Well that's stupid, customisation isn't the only appeal of Android, and there are plenty of other reasons to not want an iPhone. 
t1_dtzdq8b	1	*	Fuck the Zuck.
t1_dtz16cl	1	*	General bamboozlement. 
t1_dtz7yig	1	*	You're on Reddit. Get your head out of your ass and look around. A third of the people here drink that cool-aid, so I don't know how you missed it! 
t1_du0257m	0	*	I totally agree. The majority of my former coworkers had been through at least two other defense contractors and they'd never had to move.
t1_dtzezjh	0	*	maybe you should just click on the link and learn something. the word delete means something and the word de-activate means something. they are not the same thing
t1_dtz2vb0	1	*	all right i'll go with that too. cheers 
t1_dtz3b3y	0	*	I'm misinforming the people that actually read the article with my questions?
t1_dtz9kaj	1	*	Facebook also owns whatsapp
t1_dtzwpzo	0	*	Okay, so you're talking about what it is on paper instead of what it, you know, actually *is*.
t1_dtzmjev	0	*	It wasn't a joke. He was serious. That is why he said inclusivity is important. He just backpedalled, and you believed him.
t1_dtyt0pv	0	*	So you want your leaders to be completely stoic when dealing with the people he leads? I personally think that having a bit of personality isn't the worst thing that Trudeau has
t1_du05476	0	*	An adult man harrassing a disabled 12 year old is pretty hard to justify. You can't harass people in Canada based on a disability, it's the same in the states. 
t1_du09h4d	0	*	That's not what I was saying at all. Thanks
t1_dtze3p6	0	*	After he got ripped a new one over it worldwide, he wasn't gonna double down.

t1_dtzp0x2	1	*	This is sort of what happened with AOL, but that eventually turned into a shell of its former self.
t1_dtzeuxi	0	*	Or you can move to the mountains and block out all the nonsense, I'm pretty tempted tbh.
t1_dtz0nsd	1	*	Buying up the competition is a very effective strategy to keep having a userbase.
t1_dtyztk6	1	*	Seems like you were, you gonna say sorry for being unclear?
t1_dtzsym8	1	*	That seems like the most likely explanation ya.
t1_du06mjd	0	*	Oh, thanks for telling me what did and didn't happen to *me*. You're really smart.
t1_du16wy7	1	*	Agreed. I meant from my personal experience anyway.
t1_duqrhxs	0	*	No. Stay pissed at Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. They should all being federal fucking prison or hung for war crimes.

t1_durjeeq	1	*	theres a latin phrase for that behavior 
t1_dur1axf	1	*	No, if the feds had a reputation for fucking people over on plea deals, nobody would try to plea.

t1_dutgshy	1	*	Do you not realise that there is no evidence to find? Hence why after all this time they are charging people with unrelated crimes.
t1_dus0u34	0	*	Squirming out of what.  I think that they are guilty.   I think that they lied and got that added to their charges as well.    What in your special mind am I squirming out of?
t1_dure59a	1	*	The video is 90 seconds long. That's about as tldr; as you're gonna get.
t1_dur3mrj	0	*	This isn't all that unlikely. The Russians have murdered people in sovereign countries many times, for example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko
t1_duqvzmq	1	*	If a liar and a thief swear loyalty to you, how much is that worth?
t1_duqc577	0	*	True, I misread your sentiment then. My bad
t1_duqm1h2	1	*	Overcome the resentment, man. Serriously. For your own sake. Its not healthy to have these kinds of opinions of your fellow neighbors.

t1_duqrue1	0	*	fucking cheapskates couldnt even bother to get the good shit instead
t1_dusohzn	1	*	If you don't care that Trump is surrounded by corruption, why would you bring up as a negative for Hillary? 
t1_duqmjow	1	*	I think he's saying that **you** can't get less time for it. You'd be in prison for life.
t1_duql48p	0	*	No, it was in association to an impeachment case.

t1_duqp4pl	0	*	Its just ironic when potheads vote for the party of Jeff Sessions thats been against legalization for decades.
t1_dso8beo	1	*	You provided the source. Trolls don't read. All they tend to do is try to derail your logic. If he had anything to counter your point, he would of responded with something more then one liners. 
t1_dsp9ui1	0	*	White man goes on a few trips & thinks he knows everything there is to know. Not surprising.
t1_dspsjmm	0	*	>*I did not support this decision.*  Assuming you live in one of the countries in the world which is considered democratic then you didn't have to -  your duly elected government did it for you...

t1_dtojtyk	0	*	Did I really just write that. Oh god, I'm kind of a grammar nazi and I really feel ashamed of what I wrote right now. The their-they're error never happened to me before. Thank you for notifing that

t1_dtoes29	1	*	We had reconciliation. Look it up

t1_dtonlj5	0	*	Me too thanks
t1_dton7f2	1	*	TBF that sounds like lack of investment. The problems under Mussolini stemmed from poor leadership, IIRC
t1_dtotm00	1	*	Which is exactly why we shouldnt import or allow immigrant refugees.
t1_dtox0da	1	*	Wow, good to know. Thanks for the info! Its crazy we can call George Takei technically a concentration camp survivor. 
t1_dtoldp4	0	*	^^^ The Islamic Calphate is much more fascist. Black Panthers (while very controversial) we're more socialist. 
t1_dtot1lj	0	*	There are many similarities between the basque and the irish movement in that regard.  What is their stance on religion though? I think it's quite a different deal from one country to the other.

t1_dtog0lm	1	*	I JUST BOUGHT THESE JEANS
t1_dtoxrj0	1	*	That'd be a different kind of ignorance, though.  I'm thinking the Swiss place would look at it and go oh, that's American whereas the Western Canadians damn well know what it relates to.

t1_dtv688a	1	*	Assange isn't being accused of being a Russia agent merely because he had a show on RT. That is the absolute least of the reasons.

t1_dv2rsgf	0	*	Sure we may have similar issues, but conspiracies about deep state and wanting concentration camps for migrants is a uniquely US right wing thing. So... Fuck off buddy
t1_dv2humc	1	*	> Third, it is a slippery slope and soon well  Have dudes buttfucking each other on billboards  -My dad 
t1_dv2kfmm	1	*	This is either incredibly disingenuous or you have been rather sheltered. 
t1_dv2hgh5	0	*	Not for lack of trying.
t1_dv2sije	1	*	And overthrowing them would go about as well as it did for Zimbabwe.
t1_dv2nx79	1	*	My friend is a solid guy otherwise. If I could choose a better wife for him, I would have long before this situation. 
t1_dv2k4sp	1	*	Yeah, well that's a work in progress :).
t1_dv2zisu	0	*	Your inference =/ my implication. You inferred incorrectly and in contravention of what I actually said, where I *literally referred to leftist traitors.*
t1_dv33305	1	*	Humans gonna human. I don't expect human institutions to reflect anything other than the best and worst of humanity... especially when they're so slow to adapt and so resistant to experimentation. 
t1_dv2jids	1	*	Yeah lol no they wouldnt. 
t1_dv2kpha	0	*	What's fake about it?
t1_dv2kdl0	1	*	I know.  It's a case of accidental steampunk.
t1_dv2j8v2	1	*	> then my marriage doesnt mean anything anymore.  I think a lot of ppl are thinking of this regardless if your gay or not. The issue with marriage extends beyond gay but, I understand what you mean.
t1_dv317ln	1	*	Pardon my French. 
t1_dv2gi88	1	*	Not true at all. Id love for more people to be legally carrying.
t1_dv2j6hg	1	*	The conclusion in the article itself is that it had nothing to do with the election or dirty politics.
t1_dv3oqw9	1	*	In common parlance, sure, but rejecting a candidate is an action, while refusing to accept or reject is simply inaction. It's nuanced and can make a difference.
t1_dv2eak3	0	*	You should vote early and often.  But only as often as they are holding a vote for something.  If you can vote for a new flavor of Oreo, be there for the cause.
t1_dv2n6b5	0	*	This, I like.  I'm still pissed my Grandpa was able to freely shoot auto weapons on US soil.  Like, I understand that he killed a bunch of Nazis first, but I want my cake, and to eat it too.
t1_dv2glai	1	*	And milk for the Khorne flakes!!
t1_dv2g6so	0	*	As I get older I see most countries suck. We just are under a bigger spotlight
t1_dv2d79x	0	*	Now *that* is truly a battle between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
t1_du4dc4k	0	*	Tbh US did kinda screw Venezuela over.   Were not responsible for this descent into madness though. That was their own doing.
t1_dt6iepw	0	*	Was it a limited space though?
t1_dujqgpu	1	*	How is the government meant to intervene and cause wage growth and lower cost of living?
t1_dujl55b	1	*	Fuck you, thats my fetish!

t1_dujoej1	1	*	I don't know her, haven't read anything about her lately, so I don't have an opinion of her.
t1_dujr2tp	0	*	So what you're saying is, we should be concerned about Russia. Ok.

t1_dukgyvq	0	*	Hm.  Emasculating... That's an interesting take.
t1_dujn380	0	*	I think he's more a sycophant traitor defending a narcissist and foreign country meddling in our affairs
t1_dujmhls	1	*	If this is a joke, this is perfectly crafted
t1_dujng3n	0	*	You are complaining about name calling... and voted for trump? Or are they measured by two different standards?
t1_dujn172	0	*	Just because we are rich and powerful doesnt mean we can't collapse. And also, only a very small percentage of us are rich and powerful, the rest of us are barely holding on.
t1_dujmi7k	1	*	It's a term that is is plastered in every right wing meme as a boogie man term on social media so I think your perception of the term might be skewed.
t1_dukiie6	0	*	...right... not in the form of intelligence.
t1_dujq0db	1	*	>  If hes certain then hes arrogant and wrong and if hes uncertain hes not worthy to be president.  Welcome to how people judge every president, are you new?
t1_dukg3mv	0	*	Everything not published by the FBI is fake? 
t1_duln69s	1	*	Well that exactly was my original point, I said it isn't inherently bad. 
t1_dukdaao	0	*	They literally float this idea around so you need a sarcasm tag to show you aren't a psychopath and actually want this.
t1_dujycei	1	*	Well this is not word for word accurate, the guy above you is wrong. However it's true broadly speaking and that's bad enough.
t1_dujwlm4	0	*	>The Russian government wouldn't do anything like that without Putin's knowledge  Did Trump know this? 
t1_duk0szc	1	*	What does it mean to be good at business in this context? 
t1_dujkxrg	1	*	same score for the 'good cop' that stand around while the 'bad cop' does X. Just as corrupt as the bad cop.

t1_dtjltm8	0	*	Well they are trying to ban it in Denmark at least if we can go back far enough to the original post.
t1_dtkxlvg	0	*	The foreskin protects the glans from dirt, dust, pollutants, etc. 
t1_dtjqywn	0	*	Except not a single person in this comment chain claimed it's an equivelant loss, merely that it too constitutes mutilation.
t1_dtph44p	1	*	Alas it doesnt count, although it wasnt done long before the treatment guidelines were changed and it would have been. 
t1_dtlft3i	1	*	It tends to be the primary justification from what I've seen, although I paraphrased a bit. It's often the essence of what people who defend their choice are saying. 
t1_dtllgt0	0	*	I felt it showed that on some level even they see how absurd their beliefs are if they know an adult couldn't possibly believe it without long-term indoctrination from childhood onward.
t1_dtjhzfy	0	*	The line is pretty good where it is.
t1_dtjh7g9	1	*	Any medically unnecessary surgery is cosmetic. 
t1_dtj74j2	0	*	No problem at all! Hopefully my point makes more sense now.
t1_dtj5obc	1	*	Yup, and it looks like the [Mayo Clinic backs up your research as well](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/circumcision/about/pac-20393550). 
t1_dtjp3y1	0	*	Nope, sure won't. A smart person would follow the absolute with the caveat, but you didn't do that.  There is no reason to drive a car, except for... like that. English 101 class is dismissed.
t1_dtj0k01	0	*	You are much worse. 
t1_dtjlnfm	1	*	That monster!
t1_dtkif9g	0	*	I wish I was exaggerating.
t1_dtjhlg7	0	*	You're wrong, it's not universal even among those whose religion might still practice it. The rate of circumcision among Jews in Sweden is 'only' 40%.
t1_dtjrryt	1	*	Sure, I guess, and sometimes breasts look strange or vaginas or whatever, but we don't go in and modify those without the consent of the person they are attached to.

t1_dtk21q9	1	*	Is this caused by excessive masturbation?
t1_dtlq4xb	1	*	And in this thread is quite a comprehensive list of the harm it does. All it would take is to get the word out, you know, same as was done with FGM.

t1_dtjhe0c	0	*	Good legal, now the previous comment can never be used against me.   But we are going to have to find us a European or we are just exchanging dick picks for no educational value.
t1_dtjakqe	0	*	What if the kid decides to leave Judaism? Just thinking out loud. Can 13 year old Jews marry(religiously if not legally)?
t1_du56a59	0	*	It's english. The language you speak is english. It's not my mother tongue yet I know when to use a comma. It makes it easier to read a text.

t1_dv0m5z2	1	*	I just want these wisdom teeth out. They cause so much pain and strife , but I cannot afford to get them out. Thanks Obama. (I'm Canadian)
t1_dv0m5vr	0	*	Depends how often you camp. 136.40 isn't bad when lots of campsites are $15 to $20 a night
t1_dv2to0y	1	*	Not wanting universal healthcare (while stupid) isn't the same as viewing taxation as theft. They just want taxes that exist to be for things like drones and defense contractors. 
t1_dv1p62o	0	*	Hundreds of deaths yearly due to accidental shootings is not a miniscule number.  Though I should clarify that after checking, it wasn't a majority, it was around 1/3rd who were under 25.
t1_dv0htjp	1	*	Pretty sure it is, though again, its been a while 
t1_dv0e2ww	1	*	Not by much, since it's definitely worth it already to charge an admission to tourists. 
t1_dv072hp	1	*	Sorry
t1_dv0d83i	0	*	Right? It's scarily individualistic on issues where it often makes more sense not to be.
t1_dv03qgr	0	*	I may be a bit biased because I work nights, and I'm often outside all night. 
t1_dv13bu5	1	*	The National Park system was created in the Americas so it would be your definition of national parks that is inaccurate. 
t1_dv0zj1u	1	*	Curious what the main difference/point you are trying to make?  What are the pros/cons you are trying to state with the Canada model vs the European model?

t1_dv3sz9e	1	*	I think I get the gist.
t1_dsqb4d8	0	*	How many troops do they have? Strategic arms? Mobilization abilities?    None. We prop them up, otherwise they'd be using Soviet-era arms against modern weaponry... and this isn't 'Zulu'.

t1_dua0m6c	0	*	He asked you to cite real sources for this 60% claim and you've yet to provide a single one.

t1_dv15u5a	0	*	They pay me handsomely.
t1_dv0tw72	0	*	Double ironic because it's not like the British government gives a rats ass about anything that isn't south east England. Wales, Cornwall, etc get most of their projects funded by the EU
t1_dv0qszo	1	*	Yeah I understand lobbying as a charitable organisation etc, but I didn't realise how much money was involved in it.
t1_dv0rhq9	1	*	Yes, I did. Food with highly allergenic properties must be labeled as such.
t1_dv1frwj	0	*	Also that anti-PETA propaganda is funded by Big Tobacco and other shit companies. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Organizational_Research_and_Education under funding

t1_dv1c3yf	1	*	It's probably more along the lines of restriction rather than outright banning, though that's speculation on my part.
t1_dv0q8dj	0	*	How is it not legal in all but name?  Donors literally go out saying they won't pay politicians if they don't do as they say.

t1_dv0q2jz	0	*	Glyphosate is safer than the organic alternatives. Weeds can develop resistance to organic herbicides too.

t1_duh4td8	0	*	It's just you attack people so negatively for having a political belief. Calm down. These are not bad people.
t1_duheheo	1	*	Batman.
t1_dugopj1	1	*	This is the only thing that would scare him, I think.  
t1_dugnrmh	1	*	Combined with hard evidence of money laundering that might find its way to a certain FBI agent if he looks at them funny. That's a long stint in prison.
t1_dugfx1l	1	*	I can post an Alex Jones article trying to connect two completely separate things as a conspiracy. You can verify that they happen, that doesn't make them any less nonsensical. 
t1_dsgvysp	0	*	Nope the US is the last barbarian still left in the field everyone has since moved on from such. Its currently the main instigator of every conflict the world has. 
t1_ds3uhoy	0	*	There were consumer protections in place when it was with the FTC before, and while it is under the FTC now.  AT&T was sued under the old rules in 2014.  Why are you afraid of the simplae question?

t1_duf5zjz	0	*	It's another democrat asking someone that plays one to reconsider. If you were a patriot you would understand that's normal.  Also, I hope Burnie runs again in 2020.

t1_dsmlc2f	1	*	Kwestions seems like a more authentic spelling, tbh. 
t1_dsmpi08	1	*	There is a lot of Brythonic Celtic descendants in England as well. Its a myth I believe that the Anglo-Saxons dominate every corner of England. 
t1_dsmtpcc	1	*	Yes, because Crowder is an accurate source of information. More of a comedian than a source, really.

t1_dsmrein	0	*	Exactly how am I a parasite?  What am I leeching off of?  What is the writing on the wall?  What is coming up in the future that is unavoidable for me?  How will the world punish me, exactly?  
t1_dsmk08e	0	*	It's so strange listening to someone honestly trying to associate the American flag with the swastika and pretending the association is logical and obvious.
t1_dsmt88h	0	*	Hell no, the constitution is perfect how it is in my personal opinion.
t1_dsn64az	1	*	it isn't people's fault that they go and beat up strangers?   that's an odd belief you have there. 
t1_dsmooso	1	*	Will the tavern be named 'Quarks?
t1_dsmpcwg	0	*	Er... ok... so youre saying you should have a right to be a hateful bastard if you want to? That being a cunt is your inalienable right?
t1_dss9xnd	0	*	You're writing contrary to the concensus of Anthropologists physical and social.
t1_dsmk7h4	0	*	Well we could have an open discussion here but I guess youve opted out. So my understanding prevails and youve proven yourself spineless. 
t1_dsnsxk4	1	*	I meant I believe Khan's position is that it's a bad thing. There are quotes in this thread where he says so.
t1_dsn4byt	1	*	I mean violence by the right. 
t1_du30ud7	0	*	So both used it as a distraction. Well played on both sides then. Like said before, it's not like it would have any life or history altering implications. 
t1_du4jiqs	0	*	kama kama kama chame-lion
t1_du5a8xo	0	*	He wasn't killing it for meat, you fucking buffoon. 
t1_du5hf0z	0	*	Yeah, fuck you bob with your stupid hat and dumb gloves.
t1_du6l4el	1	*	What an insightful statement.
t1_du6ddwo	1	*	Yep, the continent where we originated, and then evolved and moved on from. 
t1_dufa2bo	1	*	> monthly  Its called rent/house payments/mortgage.
t1_ds6m6n6	1	*	I mean, I don't want to sit on the phone 12 hours a day telling people: have you tried turning it off and then on again? 
t1_dunr640	1	*	> I am in India I wear salwar kameez for 3 reasons: .... and modest in ways that Western clothing isn't,  Yes. Fantasized it.

t1_dtyvota	0	*	Or maybe they give good results, hence why they are being referred by the doctors?
t1_dtytlss	0	*	If your husband is an adult and has scoliosis, yes, thats the only way to correct it. No amount of adjustment is going to bend the bone of his spine straight.
t1_dtyyvg0	1	*	Can you say Fibromyalgia?
t1_dtyuwqx	1	*	>Also, while the whole spinal blood flow concept sounds nice  That's osteopathy. Chiropractic is nerve flow.
t1_dtytbmi	1	*	Whatever works!
t1_dtz0iwl	1	*	So a Stanley nickel
t1_dtyxura	1	*	They are all taught the quackery and nearly all subscribe to it. Some will take on board additional forms of physical therapy and massage, though.
t1_dtyqpq2	1	*	user name checks out 
t1_dtzt1gv	0	*	Businesses pay taxes, how are they represented? 
t1_duuvszu	0	*	Okay! Thats fair. Banning someone from competing because ANOTHER person cheated.
t1_ds3s0rt	1	*	I know some employers that will pay for a masters degree or some other continued education, as long as the employee signs a 1-3 year contract with them. I'm sure something similar can be done.
t1_ds45y70	1	*	Absolutely. But that's what limousine liberals are like. It's all about helping the poor until the poor are blocking their million dollar view.
t1_ds3lcb2	0	*	Again, I ask, how has he done that? 
t1_dtr7241	0	*	How? There's no good reason to support brexit. Every reason I've seen supporting it is misinformed at best. There's no upside to it.
t1_dtrdrtu	0	*	Access to the single market.
t1_dtqmp7c	1	*	Agreed. If you want to do something different, you need to show how and gather the support for it. Kinda like Innocent until proven guilty, but with politics.
t1_dtqeldf	1	*	Oh I know, I wasn't saying otherwise. It goes with them being the largest state that they are the most in debt. It's all relative
t1_dtqaype	1	*	That's still pretty impressive though.
t1_dtr3eme	1	*	Calling yourself German without ever having been to Germany just because 200 years ago your ancestors left Europe is crazy. That's what they're saying. 
t1_dtrum80	0	*	https://www.thedailybeast.com/leaked-govt-report-every-brexit-option-will-hurt-uk  Have you heard about this report? I meant it literally, not hypothetically
t1_dtr12rl	1	*	Yet, keyword.
t1_dsdin90	0	*	The outrage my responses have caused here is quite baffling. Ive literally attacked no one, but somehow Im the asshole.
t1_ds49qxk	1	*	He would have his staff only read him posts from /r/the_dipshits and then talk about how everyone on reddit loves him. 
t1_ds53uby	1	*	Thank you! I have never heard of that before.
t1_ds65e9b	1	*	The point is that you don't care because you don't care about other people. You can't imagine it affecting you personally, so you don't care.   You're not being smart, just selfish. 
t1_ds439ly	1	*	I hope you're kidding but I don't know and that makes me sad.
t1_ds47mjr	1	*	How would nuking a concentration camp help the people in it.....   Something is not always better than nothing.
t1_ds4a4ne	1	*	Where do you see failure, friend?
t1_ds4exa6	1	*	Wow easy there trying to bring facts into this.
t1_ds439wo	1	*	Golden shower god maybe

t1_ds46xm4	0	*	K, little feller.
t1_ds4ic14	0	*	At least we can hide a flag
t1_ds43l1x	1	*	I spent 4 regrettable years on /pol/ before reddit, I know that /pol/ makes memes. Thank you for your insight.  But news? No, it's all junk. 
t1_ds43hh7	1	*	Its not an argument. Lol.
t1_ds43vfn	1	*	Yeah, so does the part where you say American soldiers have to die because you believe in Trumps words. Like a cult member. I'm sure you're ready to die for your president and signing up.  Lol.
t1_ds4fkwd	0	*	As I said in another comment, Reddit comments have absolutely zero effect on Pence because he's never going to read them.
t1_ds4iotq	1	*	You're in South Korea?
t1_ds4jwhj	1	*	The rest of the world disagrees, and by definition that means it is not irrelevant.
t1_ds4529v	1	*	...only this time even more one-sided.
t1_ds49vxj	1	*	And thinking
t1_ds48781	0	*	Sad day when Americans don't know that a forum isn't just some internet lingo. Not even my first language either. 
t1_ds4hasv	1	*	With John Liguizamo?

t1_ds447ya	0	*	Considering their presidential legacies, lets beat around the bushes just a little.  
t1_ds4lrrg	0	*	Why go to the hospital for 2nd degree burns? That's something you can treat pretty well with first aid.
t1_ds42evm	0	*	No former US leader treated them this way. Hell none of them acted like 12 year olds. 
t1_ds47fm1	0	*	See, this kind of shit is the problem.  You and I live in two completely different realities. 
t1_ds4b68p	1	*	Reading.
t1_ds44pjr	0	*	waging war against good people is bad for the soul. This may not seem important to you now, but it's the most important thing I've said.
t1_ds41oar	1	*	Would there be any tingling?
t1_ds5ic5t	1	*	Cigars.... He used it for cigars.
t1_ds41omo	0	*	I mean maybe we can assassinate him, I don't know if that's an option or not.
t1_ds48m2n	0	*	He should just do what I do and look for those shiny yellow star things and only read those comments
t1_ds42o56	1	*	I agree. But the fact that the system even allows it makes it stupid. America has a lot of problems with its election systems in general though.
t1_ds4gk0j	1	*	Yeah, lets not talk about what JFK and Clinton used it for.
t1_ds4anf6	1	*	The 2.0.1.8. System is that of a Golden ~~God~~ Year!
t1_ds463zz	0	*	They also make you go crazy.
t1_ds47gui	0	*	These are the same people who bitch about America being the worlds police and refusing to contribute money to fight global warming. Seems a little arbitrary who deserves our help and who doesnt. 
t1_ds43hkx	0	*	Could you elaborate?
t1_ds44nsn	1	*	You know, if you filter out the inconvenient parts of the article, what you have there is the most 'Murican way to fix climate change I've seen.  Edward Teller would totally be on board with this.
t1_ds4ppkh	1	*	U0001f631
t1_ds42f6b	0	*	Torn from within by Russia using tribal politics and racism. Nice job, Vlad, I really didn't think you had it in you. My bad. 
t1_ds42baj	1	*	Different, sure.  But is it a fair comparison to the picture OP posted of everything being broken?  Seems a bit disingenuous.
t1_ds4aq9k	1	*	Yeah, certainly.
t1_ds4e2w1	0	*	Whatever your particular modern-day understanding may be, Americans in 1942 viewed Japanese as another race.  
t1_ds5ltfp	1	*	That's how fucked up the electoral college is. The world would sooner end.
t1_ds43hsp	0	*	If you expect the worst and do nothing to stop it you carry responsibility.
t1_ds42vv5	0	*	>Uh have you just ignored all of his cabinet picks?  I haven't.  I disagree with a lot of the choices, but again..I don't see how everything is currently broken as depicted in OP's picture.
t1_ds4r4vu	0	*	So what makes his administration especially deserving of armed uprising?
t1_ds4jxm7	1	*	Sorry man I already died twice this year. First from net neutrality and then from tax cuts. My family was lost in the aftermath of Trump withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.
t1_ds4hadu	1	*	Naah, just when a retard manages to win by telling people he was going to build wall and deport all the brown people.
t1_ds4jjww	0	*	He won't even live that long, president 2 scoops/fish filets' heart will burst before the next election.
t1_ds4phd4	0	*	An aloof normie?  Arcane anime references of giving off an effluvium of masturbation?  Cavalcade of socialists with penchants for cuckery?  Are you writing like that unironically and defending 4chan?
t1_ds4hzu0	1	*	 What Good is a Phone Call ( If You're Unable to Speak?) Would make a great title for an emo rock heartbreak song
t1_ds47cnt	1	*	The side you don't like? 
t1_ds4c39c	1	*	Bien ca
t1_ds4bt04	0	*	Eh, I could have explained things better, but I'm sick and tired of having to explain why lumping people into categories is a bad thing. 
t1_ds440r1	0	*	Blame the democratic media for bragging about Hillary winning months before election day. If it's one thing Trump has done right, is point out all the bullshit the news puts out. 
t1_ds4ct26	1	*	Like jet fuel melts steel beams, wait...
t1_ds4f7tv	0	*	Howard Dean, former governor of Vermont. Not Howard Stern, New York radio shock jock.
t1_ds4onxy	1	*	I don't think we've got time for a handjob.
t1_ds42p47	1	*	No. I'd be dead.
t1_dsbzxfw	0	*	It's interesting. Ireland, for example, is ranked several places above the US, which I found surprising (no offense to the Irish, I adore your country).
t1_dsbky9w	0	*	Nuclear power, and bicycles? perhaps.
t1_dsbwd41	0	*	Cars are shorter, but more frequent trips. One 10K trip by air, vs 250 days of 50 km trips.

t1_dt5ko1c	1	*	:D
t1_dutbkzm	0	*	Which embargoes would those be ? 
t1_duo7w0q	1	*	But you write enough to blame it on one minor aspect ?...
t1_dv1v578	0	*	Yes we did. They ignored us and called us libtards.
t1_dv1objx	0	*	Urbanites live close together on small pieces of land. Ruralites live far apart on large pieces of land. This should not grant them greater voting power but it does. 
t1_dv31f8q	0	*	Jokes on you, with FPTP it's a guarantee the majority of voters are choosing Scheer or Singh instead.
t1_dv1jocl	1	*	You're correct.  The 180k new jobs claim appears to be false.  It appears to me that it was a net negative.
t1_dv1y866	1	*	this is a lose lose win situation. the winners are countries we've imposed sanctions on with the help of allies these tariffs hurt. 
t1_dv1qltk	1	*	China did all that 20 years ago. People were arrested and charged. Nothing happened to China though except we advanced their missile technology and cut them good trade deals. 
t1_dv1z4fk	0	*	IMO he didn't release them because we would see who controls him, not because of taxes
t1_dv1sikc	1	*	I mean thats pretty irrelevant to the discussion but thanks for sharing your opinion.
t1_dv1wwvk	0	*	I keep seeing this everywhere what does it means 
t1_dv1sk8l	1	*	I saw that documentary.   Those poor poor people.... 
t1_dv2aeim	1	*	its a russian strategy to make the usa weaker via our orange muppet for a president
t1_dv3mt87	0	*	Nope.   Canada does more trade with the USA than the USA does with Canada. Canada needs America. If Canada leaves, the USA will do just fine. It is just a fact. 
t1_dv2ypvr	1	*	so that $830 will go to.. about $1k? $200 increase? that is going to decimate the car industry? 
t1_dv3s7z7	1	*	You won't regret it. Some truly cringeworthy photos.
t1_dv1v49f	0	*	The 2 party system and corporate funding is what caused the us vs them mentality. 
t1_dv1o1t4	1	*	In 18 months, when we'll still *absolutely* still occupy those countries. Ugh. 
t1_dv2d06e	1	*	Easy, breezy, beautiful Canada?
t1_dv233ev	1	*	Software too. Ive had to sign dozens with every company Ive worked for and with. And Im no where near anything defense related 
t1_dv2b1ql	0	*	Maybe not as much, but it still is. 
t1_dv1qwh5	0	*	Ok gotcha.  So your 100% foreign competition gets an effective price break because you pay more to either import steel or use US steel?   What about - how many companies will just leave the US?

t1_dv1u46d	0	*	No it's a bucket.  FTFY:  Is this a bucket of we don't have it so neither can you?
t1_dv20d58	1	*	Computers are nothing but rocks, human's tricked into doing math.
t1_dv2h605	0	*	How Canadian of you, whine and complain instead of fighting for your freedom. 
t1_dv210nx	1	*	Yes, the Democrats propping up all those John Doe investigation was a money waste
t1_dv1s2eo	0	*	I'm high, and after reading all those combinations I realized I was infact wearing diapers.

t1_dv1ysle	1	*	I agree

t1_dv266th	1	*	Probably while typing it all out on their phone or computer...
t1_dt0x2f0	1	*	Haha, I actually thought about whether or not my comment would fit, but pay millions to keep them comfortable made me pretty sure he wasn't talking about the Iraqi justice system. 
t1_dt0puic	0	*	People do come back from that level of insanity though - [Maajid Nawaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maajid_Nawaz) for example.
t1_dt0nlsg	0	*	 Wow, conspiracy much? I have no plans. 
t1_dt0rc89	1	*	As I said previously, this specific case doesn't really bother me. But this could very well turn into a precedent.
t1_dt0owbs	1	*	I mean, in a fundamental sense, courts are part of government in the sense of the institutions which are funded by the state to provide a civil service.
t1_dt12ti0	1	*	It's not even just a matter of principle; It's also about precedent. Saying hey, we're ok with you executing our citizens when you have a good reason is just asking for trouble.
t1_dt21bdc	0	*	I support love and peace, you support hate and murder. See the difference?
t1_dt0syho	0	*	Please, believe me I'm not advocating for that. I just wanted to point out that considering ISIS supporters insane isn't some bleeding heart approach. It's what totalitarians would do. 
t1_dug6g54	1	*	The current immigrants are Jewish. The Ethiopians are Jews and therefore have just as much of a claim to Israel as any other Jew.
t1_dugi04x	0	*	To be fair, Regan was a fucking monster, and put the Republican party on the path the led it towards the cesspool of traitors, thieves, bigots, and hypocrits it is today.
t1_dugbyda	0	*	I was joking, yes it is a normal tool  My grandpa was a farmer a long time ago in Singapore, rubber plantation or something like that. Machete is part of the management tool
t1_dugdogb	1	*	They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.  - Actual quote by Trump, not the one you made up
t1_duggbt1	0	*	Were the non-Jews conscripted or volunteers?
t1_dugie7l	1	*	You didn't. The guy we've been responding to very much meant that anyone Jewish cannot be considered a loyal American.
t1_dugcu9s	1	*	Back in the old days people came and gone like no big deal...but the american drug consumption holy shit
t1_dug2gu5	0	*	Okay, send them with less money. They'll feel safer. /s
t1_dugb3zt	0	*	See.. spin. Funny how you accused me of doing that.
t1_dugenxr	1	*	Ok, you're a nutter.
t1_duga1nb	1	*	No, welcome to your complete lack of understanding as to what constitutes criminal behavior. 
t1_dugbtxx	1	*	You wouldnt be for Mosquito genocide if it was on the ballot?
t1_duia9z1	1	*	If you really believe the Jews and Algos are similar peoples in their experience you're lost
t1_dsbrq8s	1	*	For sure there is at least as much extremism and bigotry on the other side. Thats why anyone advocating for a one-State solution would be quite universally hated.
t1_dsuwqnh	0	*	Come to think of it. Canadian police is probably so nice that kids mistaken them for Santa.
t1_dsuwpq0	0	*	What? lol sounds like you came out from South Park and into real life!! What have you been hiding??
t1_duc14n4	1	*	dude is probably a neo-nazi, ignore him.
t1_dskq2zt	1	*	Old uneducated white men dont fall under the 80% Republican approval rating umbrella?  Oh, but that didnt factor in that youre upset, so lets ignore it.
t1_dskn3sd	1	*	Couple that and the Draconian style fact that the federal government does not have any minimum days of leave, and America is a slave republic (see: the middle class)
t1_dsl52i5	0	*	But when it pays off its worth the risk 
t1_dskm5e1	1	*	Ya, it's just not worth it. I tried to get post karma on hiphopheads when I was really staying on top of rapper news, but I'm just not fast enough.
t1_dskrzjr	1	*	But its a shit hole.
t1_dskyt2q	1	*	I agree, especially the way it was used. There are some countries I wouldn't want to live in but I'd never call them shithole countries and certainly not discredit the people living there.
t1_dskkta9	1	*	fair and reasonable response
t1_dskozrb	0	*	Im gonna go out on a wild limb here. Alabama and Mississippi are shithole states. Throw Indiana in there too.   Source: From Chicago, burn indiana.
t1_dskmx0j	0	*	There's a difference between too hard and not possible without the votes. 
t1_dskn9eh	1	*	Its unamerican to say we dont want someone because where they came from is less than where they could be. Thats *literally* the opposite of all American principles. 
t1_dskzm4q	1	*	This country is made up of and was built by immigrants. Instead of worrying about immigrants we need to work on making American companies bringing jobs back here. 
t1_dsknr7m	1	*	The people have been brainwashed since the 90s with a steady of diet of Fox News. They're not bad people but the officials manipulating them are bad people.
t1_dskr8tz	1	*	There's a difference between the Commonwealth and the Anglo-sphere Commonwealth though 
t1_dskud8p	1	*	its horse shit, early voting is extremely flexible. you dont have to go on election day, no one has an excuse not to vote.
t1_dskk2fm	1	*	I was going to say, wtf is the guy trying to pull? I think he is trolling for the bamboozle. Dont fall for it.
t1_dsk8i1p	0	*	^ This is the attitude that made you an incel.  It's your fault and nobody else's.

t1_du4hd4y	0	*	Also foxes shouldnt even be slaughtered for anything they're not a farm animal and that's a whole other debate aside from the current conversation. 
t1_du0gh2q	1	*	Sure, but I like moral philosophy lmao.   I find it the other way, I was turned around by a utilitarian argument, and I find people telling people they are monsters pushes people away.
t1_du014y3	0	*	I've often wondered if we shelter kids from this stuff because deep down we know that they'll turn around and call us out on how fucked this is 
t1_dtzo8zq	1	*	They just dont understand how amazing a dry-aged filet mignon is.  
t1_du037hk	1	*	I agree completely.
t1_dtzu80q	0	*	It depends on where you live, but in general I agree. I struggle to condone the conditions most farm animals are kept under. 
t1_dtztomg	0	*	Maybe he's talking about the _other_ Stockholm. The sunken one, in the North Atlantis.
t1_dtzpu9q	0	*	Was 2007 a particularly bad year? Are there no more recent statistics?
t1_du0f9lq	1	*	I don't know who Khorne is but that sounds hardcore. I know it sounds crazy, but I basically fully believe that there are entities beyond our perception that control things like this. 
t1_dtzoyr0	0	*	I don't understand this analogy.
t1_dtzvsyy	1	*	He possibly just mistook the two
t1_dtzu55f	1	*	Gotcha, agreed.
t1_dtzpkxw	1	*	They will tell you that the government is too big to run without lobbying. They won't tell you that members of congress frequently have lobbyists actually write the legislation they put forth. 
t1_du16q3d	1	*	You heard it here first, folks. Lack of meat leads to eventual 'bone collapse'. 
t1_dtzyrv5	0	*	I'm messing with you. The first comment I wasn't, but the second one I was 
t1_du0g4ct	0	*	I definitely have a lot of my own vegan/vegetarian recipes.  Largely I think meat alternatives are a waste of time.  Id like food to stop pretending to be something its not.
t1_dtzvmu7	0	*	If you can't see the difference between eternal race to the bottom for every dollar and series of one-time mistakes (early Soviet Union famine), you need to think about it some more.
t1_du1hqq2	1	*	Dumist
t1_dtzpbv0	0	*	Have you ever tried it? The overwhelming majority of vegans say that it was way easier than they expected.
t1_dtzyw97	1	*	That's not how supply and demand works. If we didn't eat them, we wouldn't be breeding them. How you you let something to do waste if it doesn't exist?
t1_dtzh475	1	*	ayoooo
t1_dtzig94	1	*	thanks!
t1_dtzj2kn	0	*	They're defensive because a part of them agrees it's immoral to consume meat.
t1_du0bzr8	1	*	Going on reddit doesn't involve harming and killing defenseless beings. 
t1_du0a2ti	1	*	yes, you're right, and so what? Because they were created for that purpose by us, their suffering doesn't matter?
t1_du099t8	1	*	I have always bought Reynaldos soy chorizo it is labeled vegetarian. 
t1_dtzpk9g	1	*	What a thought provoking reply! Careful not to cut yourself on that edge!   
t1_du1fjks	1	*	I love that city so much. I had no idea about the styrofoam ban. Good on them. I hope to live there one day, or at least somewhere close to it.

t1_dt8ut38	0	*	Orangutans have far too much dignity to be made to put up with that. 
t1_dt90eke	1	*	No, probably not, because I'd actually want to pay my contractors instead of stiffing them, and not following through with countless deals. Also, I'm not a narcissistic psychopath.

t1_duh21ul	1	*	Maybe he's implicating *China* will be fine, and China gives no shits about their farmers. I'm not sure -- I definitely mean maybe in a non sarcastic way.
t1_dv4p6w1	0	*	How do European countries have an advantage because of VAT? Vat just makes everything in Europe more expensive, it doesn't factor into imports/exports. 
t1_dtwvdpp	0	*	What exactly has Trump done that the Mueller investigation hasn't uncovered? Its been over a year now hasnt it?
t1_dtx68ux	1	*	I thought that was the joke about Rose. She was supposed to be simple and innocent. But, many of her stories were actually highly scandalous, super sexy, or filled with wisdom.

t1_dt0h07c	0	*	One could argue that this makes them a German product.
t1_dt15yb6	1	*	The US does it to ensure that supplies are not cut in wartime. If the guns are made here, they can't be blockaded or embargoed away.
t1_dt0o1a8	0	*	There are consequences to war, if you leave the bad alone because there are innocents around them then the world would be an even worse place.
t1_dt0he9g	1	*	Seems to be a troll with the aggressive  bait.
t1_dtiq1xq	0	*	You know what does curve off after 50 meters though? A 4.2/4.5kg rocket. The tracer is designed such that it will (mostly) follow the trajectory the rocket would.   For ranging.

t1_dur5kij	0	*	Is it running?
t1_durb435	0	*	Actually that's a common misconception, you can do both of those things.
t1_dumt6s9	1	*	While prosecutors should certainly focus on following the evidence, too much focus on conviction rates makes for a timid justice system.

t1_dtrnsce	0	*	No not at all I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying I agree with them that it's so rare that keeping your children inside is over protective, I just don't think that makes someone a bad parent.

t1_dubm670	0	*	Attacking EU and NATO territory would make the US lose all support from other countries. And the US can't invade mainland Europe if it's united against it.

t1_dsvsv7e	0	*	>much higher poverty rate at home  Thats not due to foreign aid being too high, thats due to capitalism.
t1_dtc8srq	1	*	Oh, I see. So what you're saying is... That you WOULD promise it to some people. Your racist, heteronormative, cis-gendered bigotry sickens me. 
t1_dun410y	1	*	The dog? Or was that Colby.
t1_dumhj3n	0	*	We don't even do ourselves any good by preemptively reinforcing that idea in our own minds. You are setting back your own potential recovery by thinking that way.

t1_dsl68jb	0	*	Which books are you referring to?
t1_dtwv4g9	0	*	Talking at some one over a deal doesn't make a deal.  Trump wants to sign it, but only if it's actually effective AND doesn't screw over the US. The people who wrote it don't want to talk at all.
t1_dsizb0u	0	*	Are Tamils safe now?
t1_dsk6zro	1	*	I would agree the problem is more with people overstaying visas or that crossed in illegally.  So I'll meet you half way on this.
t1_dsk3mi5	1	*	[Its not so black and white](https://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-father-kkk-1927/) Its pretty unclear wether Fred Trump was there to support the Klan or just at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
t1_dskrkks	0	*	No it really is a lie.   You can block an entire country of people because Barack Obama enabled future presidents to do so.   You should probably read up on this. 
t1_dsjutt4	0	*	Of course it does. Ballooning lower class on welfare and benefits and using infrastructure without paying much in terms of taxes is how you end up bankrupt. 
t1_dskawkr	1	*	Yeah. Norwegians are social with those that they have a reason to socialize with. It's generally only the older population that talks to strangers in the public
t1_dsl0tw9	1	*	Ohhh ok yeah I forgot it was white peoples fault 
t1_dsk0oz5	1	*	Lets not forget that anti-obama politicians made it their promise to block anything he planned to do, that certainly has an effect 
t1_dsjv8cj	1	*	We understand it. We do not accept that it is the race of the people from these countries that makes it so. 
t1_dsk4nvp	0	*	Have you noticed the white house isn't denying it. U0001f917
t1_dsqcrhv	1	*	No, I truly don't understand how it is racist to say we want immigrants who are likely to be able to support themselves vs those who likely cannot.
t1_dsjwqw4	1	*	I mean, nearly 30 million votes in the Democratic primary. Someone certainly voted for her.
t1_dsjzya2	1	*	And that's why you aren't in a position where important people from those countries hold your opinion in high regard. 
t1_dsk4y3o	0	*	Honestly im not offended or bothered by it, im basically on the page of your professor. I just assume they aren't any more empathetic or intelligent than a middle schooler. That they never grew up.

t1_dsk16kr	0	*	Thank you for replying.  Clearly we dont see eye to eye, but I do appreciate the civil discourse.

t1_dsjx35z	1	*	Right, and a point system would treat them equally as those coming from another first-world country. Canada has it, Australia has it, and about a dozen other countries in Europe have it as well.

t1_dskgupm	1	*	So edgy
t1_dsk0yq8	0	*	Your lack of acceptance for rules and laws leads me to believe you didnt have any rules to follow as a child, and that your parents gave you everything you wanted.
t1_dskitr7	0	*	And yet Trump wants to send many people inside of America TO those countries he describes as shitholes.  You can't have it both ways, Republicans.
t1_dsjvz8c	1	*	Shutting the fuck up and not alienating the less retarded members of the party is kinda important. Plenty of Republicans think he's a fucking imbecile now, and that ain't good for reelection.

t1_dudmr3r	1	*	Oh good, you're sane. I have to check in these kinds of threads, it's a bit rare.
t1_duef7h0	1	*	That's one staggeringly hot dude.  Am i gay now?
t1_dud5diq	0	*	It's fun to watch you all scramble. 
t1_duhj13b	1	*	The way of the Bern is long and circuitous, and leads one to fight with Bernie himself.  Or something.  
t1_dud0rdm	1	*	probably not, more like trained agents. I like to think it was just some people who responded to a craigslist ad looking for social media specialists. 
t1_dudfhjg	1	*	Not when it's his own goddamn fault.
t1_dudlx1i	1	*	Fucking normie... always too late to understand. I bet you in 10 years youve forgotten this and elect a kangaroo as president. 
t1_dude88t	1	*	Didnt care who won except that they took no pro-Hillary actions and ONLY pro-Trump actions.
t1_dud4znr	1	*	not really... thats if you believe they had some major influence, which in all probability it was minuscule.
t1_dugukou	0	*	Yeah and poof just like that, your argumentation just went out the window! 
t1_dud9ysx	1	*	Yevgeny Prigozhin is absolutely a Russian oligarch.
t1_dufgblt	1	*	The Hillary campaign directed media in the US to blare Trump non stop in an effort to help him win the nomination. They figured he would be easier to beat. 
t1_dud6v9o	1	*	Mueller is pretty good wih a needle...
t1_dud9rju	1	*	Hopefully the TSA has some extra hands....
t1_dudmlsn	0	*	Look up the Magnitsky Act
t1_dtbxrf3	0	*	It's just business.
t1_duaeq6c	0	*	So he likes a dictatorship regime over a democratic republic.  How does that make him an anarchist?
t1_duagbmx	0	*	Motivation matters. It's the difference between being a whistleblower and acting as a foreign agent. 
t1_duaz4cs	1	*	You know, jokes are supposed to be funny. 
t1_du9aq72	0	*	Hilary Clinton wouldn't be in politics if she all she wanted was money.
t1_duacql8	1	*	It's already a subreddit (one I am unaffiliated with), you'd just fit in perfectly there.
t1_dsyunss	1	*	I like you
t1_dtq58fx	0	*	You sound hysterical. And you wonder why people dont take you seriously l. Youre like the infowars idiots of the left 
t1_dsiol39	0	*	Yeh lets go back to invading and taking other people's land and resources. Enslaving and murdering millions. Fantastic idea...........
t1_duuvnpz	1	*	Silly, incontinent is what I am right now, incontinent of the United States of America.
t1_duutsfx	1	*	>insert comic putting stick in your own bike spokes
t1_duuryrj	1	*	It's just a prank, bro!
t1_dshbya2	1	*	I started out reading your comment and picturing Jesus browsing wikipedia.  It was all downhill from there.   Heres a few commas in case you just ran out... ,,,,,,,
t1_dshdyfo	1	*	OMG I'm eating a sub!  WHAT DOES IT MEAN???
t1_dshqmod	1	*	Considering the number of operations submarine accidents have been extremely rare. -submariner.
t1_dsh5ym2	0	*	And you know this because you've got years of experience working with large and complex projects?
t1_dtg8hk9	0	*	Shhh let them play out their fantasy that womenless men are criminal men.
t1_dtfwgf5	0	*	>Life continues, but only sentient life requires moral consideration.  So you're pro deforestation?
t1_dt48ec9	1	*	Because he doesn't get paid hourly, he gets paid a salary. 
t1_dt3yhxq	1	*	The balance is 99% in favour of the owners and 1% in favour of the workers, so yeah it's not working right now.
t1_dt37r2e	1	*	> I don't see businesses making these changes on their own.  Yeah, I agree. Businesses that lead the way in terms of employee well-being are not a buck a dozen.
t1_dt5l4yy	0	*	We're a repair company, and actually doing better year after year. If we were failing, he wouldn't have renewed my contract for another year.
t1_dstfujf	0	*	Uhh, I replied to a lower comment describing it as a logical fallacy, not to Nixon4Prez.
t1_du5eol9	0	*	fun fact: ISIS started to lose ground only after Russian intervention  cya
t1_dsydhby	0	*	Oh yes. Like the same trial that israel gave before it killed the Palestinians he collaborated against you mean?
t1_dt6p9ta	0	*	It'd be nice, but that ain't been true for a while
t1_dt6b4cm	0	*	Bernie Sanders was the Alternate to Trump. Clinton was just next best and did NOT have the same platform as Trump. She had VERY liberal and progressive policies she wanted to implement. 
t1_dt7mop5	1	*	So no answer. 
t1_dt6cwkg	0	*	The article you quoted is from 2012 at 50%. Worldbank.org says 57% in 2016 so probably around 60% today. 
t1_dt7dcvx	0	*	It is.
t1_dt6lho8	0	*	Which nations are you walking about? America is probably the least imperialist western power
t1_dt66d4u	1	*	Danke. Ich spar mir die Mxfche und gehe off.
t1_dt68emj	1	*	yeah good job :) 
t1_dt6wcyh	1	*	A lot actually.
t1_dt6e4gr	0	*	Then you agree that Europe should help its former colonies
t1_dsor2p3	0	*	Earlier you just said this is why the Tories want us to leave  Did you mean, this is why a segment of a minority of Tories wanted to leave?
t1_dt8806m	1	*	It can't be properly regulated. We've been trying hard for 20 years, and still the animals in this industry suffer horrible cruelty.
t1_duu3952	0	*	That makes EVERY nation imperialist. That would make the distinction silly to even talk about.
t1_duwa2ml	1	*	UK allow these things. China also allowed for Mongolia and Korea to secede. Not Tibet though.
t1_due7nwl	0	*	Entitlement for not being injured at work? You've lost the plot.
t1_du6102c	0	*	Are you saying that because you believe it, or is it just a justification for revenge? It seems like most people trend towards the latter in this case.
t1_du60kh2	0	*	Gotta up the ante.  Ice cream, my dude.
t1_du6gf7d	1	*	We have Alberta for that. Alberta is Canada's Texas
t1_du61z57	1	*	VIGOROUSLY!! REPEATEDLY!!
t1_du61oze	1	*	Your command of the English language is unsettling.
t1_dueho96	0	*	No, the California market is huge. The rest of the country needs to catch up.
t1_ds5owu9	1	*	They will once they get their tax cuts for the rich and deregulations through.
t1_ds673at	1	*	Not if clown shoes the laundry boy gets us into a nuke fight they won't.  Oy vey.
t1_ds5l3x2	0	*	>  But the investigation is taking a very long time   Not compared to Watergate.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Watergate_scandal
t1_ds6q008	1	*	The whole subreddit is very curious.  Filled with fuck faced fictitious foreign facets of fascism.  
t1_ds5e1sr	1	*	Trump wants to be an autocrat, but he's too incompetent to do the job. In a way, we've dodged a bullet with this one, but we need to get Liberty under cover before the next guy fires.
t1_ds51y2e	0	*	Actually, being fat sort of makes sense, in a way. How much exercise you think his meat-body is really getting with cybernetic arms and legs that do all the work for him?
t1_ds5j470	1	*	Buttery males
t1_ds5ouyv	1	*	Wanna bet that after the repubs got their tax cuts and deregulations, they will suddenly grow a spine and start talking about impeaching trump because it is the right thing to do!
t1_ds630p1	1	*	Permanent as in his skin has been preserved in the same state for a hundred years. It's starting to melt, though.
t1_ds5rb9q	0	*	Touchxe9
t1_ds5ekmd	0	*	Sir, a Mister Matthew Perry has arrived to be suspended in your dinning room.
t1_ds5lnyx	1	*	Hopefully [in the next few years.](https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/neill-blomkamp-on-game-engines-making-district-10-w506821) 
t1_ds6penz	1	*	You're the one going out of your way to harangue others on proper grammar when you don't even bother with it yourself. 
t1_ds5tm9m	0	*	The only person jumping to conclusions about complete strangers here,.. is you. Im 100% happy to let you continue embarrassing yourself.
t1_ds5bvdn	0	*	We don't *have* fascism, they're just openly advocating it.
t1_ds5itsa	1	*	1) Trump may eventually become a liability rather than an asset to the Republican party.  2) There is a midterm election this year, after which Republicans may not hold as many of the votes.   
t1_ds51hb0	0	*	Dude, if Trump threw out a Dune reference, I would officially give up trying to understand anything anymore. 
t1_ds5c4zj	1	*	Exactly. This whole system is a sham. The only way to destroy it is to not participate in any way.    
t1_ds5150s	0	*	Bannon had something to do with that?
t1_ds6czb4	1	*	You mean Sausage by J. Depp right?
t1_ds5kusv	1	*	Ugh. Hopefully it'll be after the midterms.
t1_ds56yi4	1	*	As a Chinese-American I'm too busy crippling America's economy with hoaxes to feel anything.
t1_ds7ld0g	1	*	Okay? I never said that wasnt the case.
t1_ds65oyq	1	*	For context - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAdGYYsG7yc
t1_ds5958u	1	*	Super mega ultra fascism! Shhh noooo, it is legend.
t1_ds5oi55	1	*	That would be smart. Even if it doesn't swing majority blue, if enough reds lose their seats it could scare the party into action.
t1_ds6kgrf	0	*	You replied to the wrong person. 
t1_ds5a4qv	1	*	Smart doesn't mean always successful.
t1_dtwijve	1	*	New Ireland and New Britain?
t1_dtwlzae	0	*	Ireland is not british
t1_dtwchps	0	*	As an Englishman myself you seem to be exaggerating. I'd pick over the subjects but you seem to be entrenched in this opinion.  Drilled in from birth?! It is not that bad.
t1_dtekrgg	0	*	And no where in the book did he say  most of this could be false.  Get some fucking reading comprehension skills.
t1_dsnunfj	0	*	Living in Ghent I probably would not understand what a person with a heavy West-Flemish dialect is talking about.  That's 40 miles or so apart in the same country.
t1_dsns81v	0	*	You're comparing lifespan as a pet with lifespan in the wild. Look at how long wolves live in captivity for a more fair comparison.
t1_dt9b849	1	*	A province with it's head so far up its culture a good fart will burst every french speaking eardrum.
t1_dt91j5g	1	*	...or any tiny mining town in West Virginia...
t1_dt9pmoz	1	*	You are absolutely right.
t1_dsf768p	0	*	Yes? Why not?
t1_dt0ugxf	0	*	That is a military airport, I don't think is open to common traffic.
t1_du4giug	1	*	Not many people do.
t1_dth6tjq	1	*	It's baffling to me people think it was okay for him to contribute nothing to the DNC establishment but still expect on the ground support. 
t1_dusosjc	1	*	large businesses*   you don't get the bulk rate unless you purchase a good number of seats. 
t1_dut2f2x	1	*	My last paragraph covered your use case, and I agree that most of my post doesn't apply to such a use case.
t1_duwgcmg	1	*	Ok. Youre dick MUST be bigger. Obviously since your number of years is larger, that clearly means I know nothing and *didnt* see what I saw out there. My bad
t1_duhwfdv	0	*	The pioneers would ride these babies for miles!
t1_dslp28e	0	*	The liver regenerates, it's the only internal organ that has that capability.  He should be fired for unprofessional conduct, but to say he 'mutilated' the patient is dramatic hyperbole.
t1_dswbc5p	1	*	I thought that was Frosted Flakes?
t1_dv39bqg	0	*	Well of course the subject isn't Bernie, the argument is that basically it started as an anti-jerk (so to speak) about Bernie.  The link doesn't really prove or disprove that at all
t1_dv3gw55	1	*	Well, to be fair, that's pretty much reddit in a nutshell. 
t1_dv36we0	0	*	Smart jews?
t1_dv3d4t1	1	*	Grok, lol. 
t1_dv3ci9s	1	*	It's horribly sad. This is the kind of thing that happens in fictional totatilitarion dystopias.
t1_dv8x6bk	1	*	I said nothing about speech. 
t1_dv3hskk	1	*	I used to like that song. Once again red hats ruin everything.
t1_dv35xyc	1	*	Yeah but Hillary's emails though. 
t1_dv3bzql	0	*	Looking at other sources I've come to the conclusion I was wrong. Thanks for a source to read
t1_dv3a4i1	1	*	But this chain is in reference to stickied post letting people know that Nazis would be there. They just showed up.
t1_dv4hz5w	1	*	Wrong. r/t_d is the destruction of /pol/
t1_dv3l89q	0	*	My bad, didnt realize I was talking to a political genius 
t1_dv3ht90	0	*	It was after 2013 and I was auto subscribed to politics along with those others I mentioned and more.
t1_dv3c1d1	1	*	2 meta
t1_dv385d8	1	*	wow.  that ... that was amazing.  is this performance art??
t1_dv3fqe2	1	*	Probably should have listened to Romney about Russia 
t1_dv39yf9	1	*	lol that's going to be an earworm for the day for sure. thanks for that. :)
t1_dv3pq44	1	*	Its not a propaganda poster, but Kilroy was here was one of the OG memes.  Lombards fighting snails was the OG racist meme
t1_dv3a2tz	0	*	Or America is so far right, the center looks left. 
t1_dv3enns	1	*	That was one of the last useful updates Reddit has made!
t1_dv36qna	1	*	Most conspiracy theories are skepticism in the face of evidence, not in it's absence.
t1_dv3fme1	1	*	I agree, but the reasons I list I still feel.is a reason they haven't closed the sub.
t1_dv3nxi5	0	*	Those lackeys were all Republican... 
t1_dv3corj	1	*	Or memes are just online posters.
t1_dv3pr6y	1	*	Its not a propaganda poster, but Kilroy was here was one of the OG memes.  Lombards fighting snails was the OG racist meme
t1_dv3c4o5	0	*	Just because there's no legal precedent doesn't mean it doesn't work. It could very well end up in a court case and the judge rules in favor of it.
t1_dv3kq7s	1	*	So...still no links to upvoted posts in r/politics discussing how r/politics was influenced...  
t1_dv3o362	1	*	Seriously? You're busting out that nonsense in this thread? 
t1_dv39dv3	0	*	Ask any centrist looking at either sub from the outside and that's the impression we get. Unrepentant obstinacy is an annoying trait to have, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum.
t1_dv3xhmx	1	*	Wait, that's why? I enjoy that song...
t1_dv3aah9	1	*	True, I was unbanned from Twox shortly after.
t1_dv3ei92	1	*	Fair.  Perhaps it's more of an incubation chamber than a quarantine. 
t1_dv3oatw	1	*	Jokes on trumpsters. The reddit admins are LIBRULS! HAHA
t1_dv3etaf	0	*	Ill remember to not care about what you claim
t1_dv3drq3	0	*	Well shit
t1_dv37pxs	0	*	>Literally an offshoot of /r/T_D.   No... the subreddit PREDATES T_D by years.  It's been here on Reddit for 5 years.  Quit lying.
t1_dv3wb2g	1	*	Wow. That seems to be correct...  Song  - https://youtu.be/GKzsktuqwyU  Strange Trump video - https://youtu.be/MKH6PAoUuD0  Wow. 
t1_dv3o27e	1	*	I guess i am the dick nipples of r/steroids, I'll take it as a compliment hahaha
t1_dv380gc	0	*	I wouldn't be surprised if reddit management were instructed not to touch the sub, perhaps by some three letter agency
t1_dv3d7p5	0	*	No I cant be fucked and dont care enough if Im honest. Feel free to put this down as a win for you. 
t1_dv59htw	1	*	Yes. QED

t1_dv3eakx	0	*	wait...what?
t1_dv3985u	1	*	7 years? Bwahahahaha
t1_dv38zgf	1	*	9/10 of the most gerrymandered states are gerrymandered to Republican interests. Go ahead and pretend bofe parties
t1_dvcdbkg	1	*	Plus movements similar to the one that's buoyed Trump are springing up all over Europe. They have a stake in seeing how things are happening here.
t1_dv38se4	0	*	That's what I told her. To never make a politician, even a *good* one part of your identity. Yet alone Donald freakin Trump.
t1_dv3fp0a	1	*	Yep. That'll be the narriative. With this fact coming to light about Russian intervention, reddit might have.more ground to stand on. 
t1_dv3krxl	1	*	I would argue that LSC is not anywhere on the level as T_D. LSC is far from a hate sub
t1_dv763i1	1	*	Remindme! 38 days
t1_dv3bqpf	1	*	So when do we get t the remake of *The Producers* but about Trump's campaign?
t1_dv3c315	1	*	I was banned from r/offmychest for a comment in the Donald that got me banned from the Donald. 
t1_dv3osvt	0	*	Who was spoofed?
t1_dv3f586	1	*	Take some gold buddy
t1_dv43i6h	1	*	So its your alt troll account?
t1_dv3acer	0	*	What was your source, out of curiosity? I have a degree in IR and I wouldn't agree with that. I concede that they are both focussed on the importance of the state, but that's where it ends.
t1_dvcvh9p	1	*	there is Ask_TheDonald for that
t1_dv3awbi	1	*	Not a problem! If you dig through some of the comments in this chain you will find MUCH better write-ups about it.
t1_dv3ex62	0	*	Yeah, why would I expect a poor, put-upon conservative to make any effort to defend his ~~opinion~~ feelings.
t1_dv5x0xo	1	*	I think you're still not getting it.
t1_dv3pj15	1	*	You know, thats the kinda stuff the Russians were doing, creating camaraderie with wacky stunts. Wouldnt be surprised if the troll farm came up with the nicknames. 
t1_dv39t07	0	*	Probably because squirrels are all a little nuts
t1_dv3bw4g	0	*	I'm a hiring manager for a giant tech corp. It's not sweeping, anecdotal sure. Go take a look at the numbers of our STEM graduates compared to Asia or Europe.
t1_dv37nyb	1	*	Who knew Trump was actually Bialystock this whole time?
t1_dv3j54a	0	*	I thought they were claiming they are all pedophiles.
t1_dv4hcra	1	*	That had not happened yet.  And there was no way to know it would.
t1_dv38t6s	1	*	Not for long 
t1_dv45lpi	1	*	Yes. History has consequences that sometimes have to be dealt with in the present. Shocking, isn't it?
t1_dv37gym	0	*	This is the real talk. Follow the money. 
t1_dv3oh9t	1	*	Lol okay man

t1_dv3ocmn	1	*	Not from a redditor
t1_dv3chvl	1	*	Oooh latestagecapitalism was a fun ban for me. There was a thread about humor and comedy in socialist countries, and I made a comment about 20% state mandated laughter and got banned by the mod. 
t1_dv46q2o	1	*	That might be the reason, but I'll just assume because it's like the human centipede, and they constantly eat and regurgitate their own shit.
t1_dv3sldw	0	*	You mean the one who [DIDN'T want FPH banned](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc/)? 
t1_dt59qhr	0	*	It's important. 
t1_dt6j7x8	1	*	totally understand why they're trying.  you understand why the US and other countries object?

t1_dt5da1t	0	*	So not a democracy.
t1_dt5trkv	0	*	Artifcial islands are plenty around the US, nevermind the Guano Act actually claiming piles of bird shit in the ocean. Historical rights, think Guantanamo Bay.
t1_dt979j0	0	*	Not too hard as you were not in context to begin with.
t1_dt5xraq	0	*	You're setting an outlandishly high bar as far as expectations are concerned. 
t1_dssrep2	1	*	What did I do to warrant personal attacks like that? 
t1_dt5qa55	1	*	There wasn't really any kind of meta revelation in the panama papers. If anything to me the revelation was it's apparently not a big deal to offshore.
t1_dthgiu6	0	*	Why are the thousands of Dutch who wish death on Americans every day here not a good sample?
t1_dspm53a	1	*	I prefer not to speculate too much.
t1_dspr9ff	0	*	Ackthually, tell me more x-ray specialist/physics expert.
t1_dspw8cw	1	*	It is definitely a blog. Mondoweiss is not a news source. 
t1_dsq1ez4	0	*	Clearly you do, but that doesn't make them valid, it makes you a fool. He is biased, as are you.

t1_duinm0y	0	*	Problem: most of the people entering are refugees, and they have a right to asylum.

t1_dv3xis7	1	*	Oh yeah everything's as it should be here, if humans had never existed the earth would be in the *exact same state*
t1_ducb07l	1	*	Im not a Robin expert but I believe comparing the unsavory fictional characters he stole from to innocent nurses makes this hypothetical rather useless.   
t1_duc8eo1	1	*	Sign language gay dove erotica, my favorite 
t1_dsemy6a	1	*	Oh my bad I thought we were talking *before* the election like you said earlier. I didn't realize that only applies when it's to defend him. 
t1_dta5l82	1	*	Of course it makes no difference whatsoever.  It's just an obscure little anomaly.  
t1_dsf6rjb	0	*	Except for jokes apparently. Can't have those, they might cause the feeling known as 'fun'.
t1_dsf48et	1	*	That's a massive assumption and a bit offensive. Perhaps elaborate on your only point instead of saying you're wrong and an active member of 4chan.  
t1_dsf6vuy	0	*	Yes but if this isn't expressed along lines of hiring, promotion, or management, its extremely tricky to prove.
t1_dsf8foc	0	*	You too my friend. I see we both enjoy browsing the same pastures :)

t1_dtrcdr8	1	*	Tobacco prevents aging, thanks for tip
t1_dtrbibv	1	*	I like memes as much as the next guy, but putting random text over pictures of minions is enough to drive anyone to the edge.

t1_dtrj9kk	1	*	> The other site where you watch German midget Porn, everything.  Great job pretending you don't have that memoriezed, bookmarked and set as your home page! We all totally believed you! ^/s
t1_dtrna18	0	*	Thank you for understanding!
t1_dtrayl3	1	*	The change to 240 eas somewhat annoying, but otherwise Twitter's been great. Except the amount of bots is concerning...

t1_dtrlm1n	1	*	Dank memes and milfs.
t1_dtrql0q	1	*	You logged into your browser, like you were walking onto a yatcht.
t1_dtrbvk8	1	*	The first time I went there I assumed it was making fun of minion memes. It was just minion memes. Imagine my disappointment.
t1_dtrltvr	1	*	I got a PM on my last account that said 'Hello, *real name*'.  Abandoned that one quick sharp.

t1_dtrc7nu	0	*	You just reminded me of the old palm pilot my mom gave me as a kid, which said it could store web addresses, and I was so let down that it couldn't actually do the internet in the palm of my hand. 
t1_dtrcs65	0	*	come on man, people barely have 1-5 real friends now a days.

t1_dtrerij	0	*	It might be, but we all already have facebook and are years deep into these groups. 
t1_dtrboiy	0	*	The volume of ads in the newsfeed is beyond ridiculous at this point. Thats my main problem. Search the web for a product one time, get bombarded on Facebook till you die with ads about it.
t1_dtrew8d	0	*	What makes you say that? I haven't kept up with discord changes, so I didn't know anything was going differently from before.
t1_dtru0bn	1	*	Ugh yeah, that terrible, terrible site. You know, that site is so terrible I've scrubbed its name from memory. Remind me of it again so I can make sure to avoid it?

t1_dubo4wj	1	*	You are committing major ad hominem.  Just stop.

t1_ducr11z	1	*	just trying to put it into layman's terms.   I guess a good analogy would be if their seeds came with ransom-ware.
t1_dubkk49	0	*	> Irrational people like you instead blindly accept whatever Trump says and calls anything that reports otherwise Fake News.  [Citation needed]
t1_dubndjd	1	*	Did thread filtering not work then? I filter out Trump posts fairly effectively, for my mental health. I still end up in discussions a lot, but that's comment-level usually.
t1_ducbrgd	1	*	Nobody sensible is blaming Russia wholly for these problems, but it's undeniable that Russia is aiming to capitalize on them and widen the underlying divisions.
t1_du1oo3b	0	*	I'm not worried about wifi in my fingers, though.

t1_dtky5vj	0	*	Mature adults don't want to take it out on people. They want to work together with other mature adults to fix the problem.  This doesn't lend itself to hot takes. Sorry.

t1_dtkwcoq	0	*	To a lot of people it's a moral issue.  
t1_dtl9k1w	0	*	that doesn't really make any sense, since meat is more expensive than vegetables per unit protein or calorie.  
t1_dtkwdfg	0	*	You mean Reddit is exaggerating?!?!  NEVER!   ...but seriously though, it's still a problem because people are dying. ...it's not just a world-ending level problem.

t1_dthsoxg	1	*	Soooooooo not guilty? Cheers.
t1_dthgdnh	1	*	Guilty until proven innocent.
t1_dthdx74	1	*	It's a lot harder to defend your belief in religion with more critical thinking. Not saying that two can't be reconciled but it sure takes a hell of a lot more work.
t1_dthclkq	0	*	Yeah I don't believe that. She won by 3 million votes. 
t1_dtjjvvk	1	*	You are reducing it to family group level now? Well, the Romanov dynasty still has pretenders who are alive. Bolsheviks? The communist party is the second largest political party in Russia.
t1_dthcsae	0	*	Rich LOL 
t1_dth4lah	0	*	If you're a canuck, then shut the fuck up?  Why do you care that Americans would be disturbed that Russia has a tape of Trump getting pissed on by hookers?  He's not your president.
t1_dtiift0	1	*	> Because the latter is all under one party, the center dominates.  On the contrary, the center is still losing.

t1_dthzwnh	1	*	ok sure. 
t1_dthgfp0	0	*	I do.
t1_dthfnno	0	*	That's not what the security clearance reviewers cares about. They care about the possibility.

t1_dtht8q1	0	*	Will you eat your hat if she doesn't get any charges?
t1_dthn6yb	1	*	Fast and Furious  (not the movies, the selling guns to cartels) was pretty major.
t1_dthnp1z	0	*	I'd tell you to listen to BBC and NPR, but then you'd probably paint them with a broad brush.
t1_dthj1u8	0	*	>Whatever propaganda may be, it differs from such techniques because it resorts to suggestion and persuasion  Thanks for proving my point. 
t1_dtgzdkg	0	*	Did you even read that article it backs up the person above you saying the DOJ thinks it would be reckless 
t1_dthef04	1	*	No. They're winning right now. But there is no end of history until human extinction.
t1_dttdikr	1	*	To be fair, Judit Polgar was a *very* unique outlier; there have only ever been three women in the top 100 players, and Judit was the only one to ever break the top 10.
t1_dthhm1t	1	*	A blanket statement is not fixing any problem

t1_dti164l	1	*	Absolutely fucking scandalous. 
t1_dtijeg5	1	*	> simultaneously a world-conquering criminal mastermind, while also being completely incompetent and stupid.  That's what the Nazis said about the Jews too.
t1_dthpmw8	0	*	...Comey saying no crimes had been committed for one.
t1_dthljux	0	*	Yeah, the witchhunt was really successful. 
t1_dthm3ic	1	*	No, it's not *from* that guy, he got it from an intermediary between himself and Shearer.   There's nothing to suggest Steele made any changes to it. 
t1_dtikewg	1	*	Yes, the guy is a genius. But there's a lot more beyond his work, and I find it amazing that Harari ignores all of it. 
t1_dthuxot	1	*	>You know we're lying, but the Americans don't know they're being lied to just as much, so you're better than them.  Is it bad that as time goes on; this statement is becoming less and less of a lie?

t1_dthbc9a	1	*	Damn, can I save a user?
t1_dti3g3g	1	*	I'm not blaming anyone and am aware that  a large percent of women were in favor of Trump too.  I am simply stating what the statistics on demographics say
t1_dtiebv6	1	*	You know the other forms of gevernment were tried already, right?  That's like.... why we became a country. One of those ways didn't work for us.
t1_dthgnco	1	*	Ooh were all scared now 
t1_dths0t3	1	*	You hypocrite. Face it... you only hate Trump because he's orange.
t1_dthng3y	0	*	Ironic that you bring up carpet bombing while asking what issues some had with Obama. 
t1_dthhazq	0	*	You think fox, cnn, msnbc, etc don't lie?  Oh, I see.  When they do it, it's just an error.  
t1_dti7x5a	0	*	I mean we also never had a president that actually seemed like he supported white nationalists before. Not condoning people calling you a nazi, but times are interesting. 
t1_dss5s7y	1	*	lol
t1_dssx4zk	1	*	Actually back then it was much harder to leave.  You should ask her what special circumstances allowed her to leave the country.  
t1_dssc0dz	0	*	So and idiot, gotcha
t1_dshfczc	0	*	From Websters bigxb7otxb7ry bitr/Submit noun intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.  Yes it applies.

t1_dthia8w	0	*	I'm not reading your absurdist theories, sorry. 
t1_dtgn3i1	1	*	I dunno, the IRA (not that one, the Internet Research Agency; they've probably rebranded by now) pays really quite well by Russian standards, if what I've read of them is true.
t1_dtgp0ub	1	*	Why do you think it's the social media of choice for the orange? It's also that and the murky beginnings of the endlessly retweeted info, keeping things nice and muddled and obscure.

t1_dtgjon2	1	*	Elections will be suspended or hacked to pieces
t1_dtgjn27	0	*	That is often the argument right? Get the system to the point where the people are dependent on the system.  Then you can't bite the hand that feeds you.

t1_dtyq7vu	0	*	Interesting how the claims of the article about the memo don't match the memo itself.
t1_dtywd7y	1	*	Do a little research my dude.  They absolutely attempted to influence both sides.  Anyone who is even slightly informed on this issue knows that.
t1_dtywz3v	0	*	Have you ever read up on what previous Presidents have done?  The only difference now is the media informs us about everything and well...Trump tweets everything.

t1_dtyn3e7	1	*	haha yes
t1_dt4x5v4	1	*	From the relatively small amount of reading I've done, it can be done by slightly lowering the temp during flowering depending on strain. If that's stress, probably a good thing.

t1_dtop34m	0	*	And I've acknowledged this in the last paragraph of my last comment.
t1_ds26pga	1	*	US should not have divided Korea into 2 states after WW2. NK wouldn't have needed to invade SK if US didn't divide Korea into 2 countries after WW2.  Learn some history bro.
t1_ds6w7rg	0	*	True think we're all guilty of that to some degree but some folk take it too far only a sith deals in absolutes 
t1_ds8kj1q	0	*	And a team has to use it's income for more than just the players wages.
t1_ds7exnw	0	*	Better get a job that cant be done by a machine 
t1_dsfkas9	1	*	well that's a shitshow.  holding folks with no seniority-based salary progression for any protracted period of time will lead to disaster.  thanks for the context.
t1_du96z4t	1	*	That shit was just evil 
t1_duakp8q	1	*	We can, look up biofuels.
t1_duak98o	1	*	500 is the lower bound bud. Its called uncertainty. You get a range of possibility. 
t1_du97ma9	0	*	I think the point of the fly-bys is leverage. It takes orders of magnitude less effort, just little nudges.
t1_du96459	0	*	This is still much more far off then the comment said.
t1_du9nsd2	1	*	true, its like when the population of Rome tanked massively after the aqueducts were destroyed by barbarians.
t1_du97oqx	0	*	This totally disregards evolutionary processes. I'm sure that life will find a way as the saying goes.
t1_du96mo9	0	*	For credible nuclear deterrence. It can't be credible if you're not willing to use them. Russia is willing. 
t1_dsp1thb	0	*	I'm playing the devils advocate here, so I don't believe the idea.
t1_dsp8ztf	1	*	These people have an inferior culture for that exact reason, and probably a few others.

t1_dtyaokr	0	*	~~No, obviously not. Quit with that whataboutism.~~  Ignore me.
t1_dty9l8z	1	*	No. When the storms clean the solar panels, they just blow off the accumulated dust, allowing more light to reach the panel. They don't sandblast the surface.
t1_dsosuyn	0	*	And then in the 70s the US became buddy buddy with Israel. What are you trying to deny here?
t1_dssfik8	1	*	You can't stay on topic so let me ramble on about debating and logic. Uhh, okay dude. If China is so great, why not move there and stay behind the great firewall?
t1_dsw216i	1	*	Interesting, I never even had a chance to respond to the fellow and his post has disappeared. Not sure what he was going on about.
t1_dsse3cs	0	*	It's funny to me that you actually believe they will fall any time soon.    edit: queue the delusional communists. Reddit is very amusing indeed.
t1_dssgluy	0	*	54% military spending as 2015 and as we all know now is more than that now. That is no 20% of the total.

t1_dteyyua	1	*	Living in Israel as a Muslim may be the best, on the other hand living in the OPT would be hell.
t1_dtfsm85	1	*	Okay but if we could just put a ban on people saying _______, my dude that would be awesome. 
t1_dtezk3j	0	*	But what *is* progress? That seems to be the largest hang up
t1_dtff3hw	0	*	Hey dude, quick question. Did Mohammad have a flying horse? 
t1_dtfmbh4	0	*	Youre missing the point. His point is not about feminism. 
t1_dtf3zke	0	*	yeah it's definitely sickening to see all this misogyny. I want to blame Russian trolls (which maybe there are some) but I feel the truth is sadly they're real people... 
t1_dtf7hud	0	*	You sure are good at posting text walls that say nothing to obfuscate the truth
t1_dtezx4i	1	*	Totally right! Women cant rape! /s

t1_dtex1iq	1	*	Exactly.
t1_dteyeki	0	*	> engage them like people  That almost always ends up as No, you come to my way of thinking and fuck you, I don't have to concede on shit. Not necessarily the most productive of methods.
t1_dtgcfgd	1	*	You've never heard of a hat?
t1_dtf2xr7	1	*	Because there are efforts being made in trying to make it illegal.

t1_dtev69m	0	*	That's pretty rude lol
t1_dtf9dhn	0	*	The middle East is fucked up and our culture at the moment is much more progressive. That isn't racist that's true. That doesn't mean Muslims themselves are terrible people
t1_dtf850l	1	*	Santa brought the presents, your mum wrapped them and wrote the notes  EZ - PZ
t1_du2943t	1	*	You are correct. Its federal law mandated by the patriot act
t1_du2lbdn	1	*	Awww. Did someone in denial get hurt ?
t1_du2d4f5	1	*	That's part of the timelines getting mixed up at the end of 2016.
t1_du27r2e	1	*	That hasn't been my experience.
t1_du2i4h7	1	*	Thanks, thats a solid list
t1_du3ihdd	0	*	Lol no,if you're in any kind of management,you will be getting calls from underlings who's name you can't even put to a face.
t1_du30sus	1	*	Haha maybe not you then. The dude that messaged me was pretty chill about it. Even sent me a screenshot
t1_du2aycs	1	*	Trump's hired the best people with yuge brains.
t1_du2c97q	1	*	As long as you are the authority on it, Mr. Assistant Manager.
t1_du28c5i	0	*	No problem whatsoever.  *Frye? Frye? Frye?*
t1_du2kzuk	0	*	right, because the only cash paying jobs are collecting phone books outside on the heat? 
t1_du2r2b0	1	*	Im always baffled when I read threads like this. Did you know that in most European countries credit scores don't even exist? 
t1_du30v5k	1	*	I got a screenshot of the activity from them. But then I realized how futile it'd be to take it to the phone carrier and more or less accepted my fate
t1_du27dix	1	*	Yeah except in order to rent at most places, they do a credit check. So yeah you dont need a loan to rent an apartment but you either need credit history or a co-signer and their credit history. 
t1_du296mj	0	*	I think that's not true. You should be able to use your passport if you have one. If they don't accept it, you should not bank with them. 
t1_du29m23	1	*	Oh darn and dang. Whatever shall we do. Nothing. We shall do nothing.
t1_du31um6	1	*	'you're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole' 
t1_dsy8fh8	1	*	everyone knows 10 year olds can consent. Thats why they vote. 
t1_duavqgy	1	*	True. But counting on that support isnt a very good long term survival strategy. Alliances change all the time.
t1_ds12ci4	1	*	Thank you very much.
t1_ds29vp3	0	*	I do understand, I just also disagree that you can have benevolent sexism. You can have certain people benefit from sexism, but it comes at a price. 
t1_ds162av	1	*	Oof feel empowered their shitstain?
t1_dsepcri	0	*	So you think multiple women risk getting a defamation lawsuit and possibly ruining their public lives for fun?
t1_dsexpv6	1	*	That's not how any of this works. Regardless of the situation, the accuser always has to provide evidence of wrongdoing. Just making a claim and then vanishing isn't going to fly anywhere 
t1_dtx0yzv	0	*	I fart in your general direction

t1_duxd5km	1	*	Cheers
t1_duxde8s	1	*	The whole healthcare for non managerial positions in the public system in quebec is unionized. So id hazard to not much would change :)
t1_duwp8vy	1	*	Oh. Youre damned if you do and damned if you dont, I suppose.
t1_duxisnp	1	*	The fix for everything is increasing the number of graduate. This artificial shortage is wrong on all levels.
t1_duxvmzb	1	*	Here comes Potvin with some poutine and maple syrup for you.  IV.

t1_dtt4sfx	1	*	Thankyou u/freexe
t1_dsmzo9e	0	*	I'm not really mad, just disappointed. Guess I just have higher standards than you
t1_du9zwe2	0	*	Makes perfect sense. Let them consent when they are adult to have their life terminated. Can't let the parent decide to subject them to an unnecessary procedure.
t1_duaippz	0	*	You can rub the right person's foot and they'll have an orgasm. Some people can think themselves into having an orgasm.
t1_du9c8q8	0	*	Aww bless, you're so insecure about it :(  Have you tried speaking to a psychiatrist?
t1_du98rop	1	*	What serious harm? I was circumcised professionally and have no problems with my penis, not to mention I think it looks nice and is simple to clean.
t1_du9c9dp	1	*	> dirt rascal
t1_du9a5sa	1	*	Actually I think his linked article refutes your statement pretty solidly. Also, your random capitalized words make me imagine an obese midget screaming, which made me giggle slightly. 
t1_du9feat	1	*	Would you? I never brought that up
t1_du9c6y5	1	*	Actually it being a baby isnt required https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_(circumcision).  Guess i was wrong
t1_dv276o3	0	*	They're putting tariffs on imported goods. The EU is putting tariffs on exported goods. Prices will go up. You're comment makes no sense at all.
t1_dsocnn7	0	*	> So before you can make a judgment on it walk a mile in their shoes.  I'm not making a judgement either way. But I can say without a doubt that shooting non-combatants is not SOP.
t1_ds8oycm	1	*	it wasn't a rename
t1_ds8h3eq	1	*	[People occasionally try](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform) and IIRC that's why America spells some words differently from Britain (e.g. color/colour.)
t1_du6s1ae	1	*	Just so you know, Nokia has a manufacturing plant in China as well
t1_du73hhz	0	*	They didnt legalize bribery. Its never been legal. It seems you dont want to actually learn about what lobbying really is. 
t1_du93ms7	1	*	Orwells horror could still happen when the rug is ripped out from under us.
t1_du9l3c0	0	*	You only get arrested if you fail. You look at recent coups like the ones in Zimbabwe and Fiji. The coup leaders became the 'reformers'.
t1_du9vk0b	0	*	Yes, but it doesnt merit him to go to jail because it's plausible he is planning a coup. 
t1_du9jfvg	1	*	No, you don't. You may get questioned a bit, but nothing more. Threatening the safety or the life of the president/chancellor/prime minister yes, that's grounds for prison just about anywhere.
t1_du6xx54	1	*	you do know that many protestors were actually killing assads people and there were snipers targeting police/military? Try doing that in the US and see what happens to you.  
t1_du7dloi	1	*	I swear I had read about him doing security consulting shit in the UAE. Could be wrong about that though, I havent researched him that thoroughly. 
t1_du7c6zz	1	*	Just a pet theory, but seems they needed to shed a redundant workforce and were eager to trade that for resources that found new value.  
t1_du7kp67	0	*	Where's my cybernetics that allows me to judo flip a building-size mech?
t1_du7ch6b	1	*	There were US advisers there and they responded with aircraft support which I'm pretty sure the SDF can't muster.
t1_du6ukyg	1	*	I know, and I agree with you. I was just given more context to the previous comment
t1_du6nd3g	0	*	I read an article by them about this earlier, can't find it now, but it wasn't as neutral as the article we're discussing. 
t1_du7274z	1	*	You can't prove anything.  Even in a court of law, when people are convicted, it's due to evidence, not proof.
t1_du6oe3q	1	*	I mean, those are two separate things...
t1_du7m8m8	1	*	yes. As bad as ISIS is, its not okay for any country to just join in
t1_du76o7x	1	*	Laws are odd, you can use White Phosphorus as a smoke making agent legally, you can also legally use it as a thermal weapon, but its illegal to use as a chemical weapon.
t1_du6p5l4	1	*	Yes
t1_dsjesu0	0	*	Sure, Germans caging people who don't have their same beliefs. I guess some things never change

t1_dtwejzq	0	*	yes obviously i also mean the Kurds in those countries should get a vote and Im talking about what should be, not what is practical

t1_duvddxc	0	*	And nowhere i said they are responsible for everything
t1_duvpjdi	1	*	Well we know America isn't. Maybe I'm naive in believing that EU is rather dysfunctional in this regard to pull something like this, and whatever happens happens at state level.
t1_dsn8ctu	1	*	US doesn't always blame Russia.  I answered the question, nope am not.
t1_dst7l8c	1	*	Well, Trump didn't throw millions of regime dissidents (and the families) in there, for one.  
t1_duxhz8m	0	*	The meeting concluded that eating glyphosate isn't a risk.  That's what I said...
t1_dsxuk60	1	*	polynesian sauce as lube

t1_dtwrtwg	0	*	Something youd like to say?
t1_dtxp9nc	1	*	> Falcon Heavy is obviously so much more than science and tech.  True, but before it is anything else, it is science and tech.
t1_dtwnvdw	0	*	They are relatively more fair in the same sense that punishing the class for the bad behaviour of a student is relatively more fair.
t1_dtxj6k9	1	*	The difference is legality and openness. The alternative to punishing the administration is to punish the american people.
t1_duz3m2j	0	*	So, what is the function of the Government?
t1_dsbv7zd	0	*	The point is: It's not even close to enough assuming that everyone whose application has been denied has to leave. Not even close.
t1_dscucmz	0	*	But what do you do once someone from El Salvador makes it to US soil and is likely going to be killed if they go back to El Salvador and the other Latin American countries won't take them?
t1_dscvu8v	1	*	Honestly, let them continue that policy and then perform a rigorous study on what the effects are.  I wonder if letting in appropriate refugees as opposed to any refugees will physically manifest.
t1_dt2d8kf	1	*	I just explained it to you....
t1_dt2kr09	1	*	Ok I wont blame the mode of production we have in society for our economic woes. That should provide a clear analysis of the issues at hand. What a great idea, you totally changed my mind.
t1_dt1whvq	1	*	The big problem is the evaluation of real estate. When a landlord is told the property is worth x, they try to get x plus profit. In a real estate bubble, it becomes a chicken/egg phenomenon. 
t1_dt2656d	1	*	Damn, you seem like an awesome person.
t1_dt1tjfu	0	*	So why don't we get rid of money?
t1_dt21hj3	0	*	Oh, then I guess we're both wrong. Me for thinking that wealth earned in 2017 is the same as income, and you for thinking that wealth earned in 2017 is the same as total wealth.
t1_dt1u4vy	1	*	Education and critical thinking skills
t1_dt28edj	1	*	I've never been super into 'things' though I did buy a lot of musical instruments for a few years. Mostly I spent money on travel.

t1_dt9jjmc	0	*	That's not how the modern world works.
t1_dt200wx	1	*	I think I'll limit my political career to analysis and writing. I just like my sanity too much for anything beyond that.

t1_dt2kghh	1	*	He makes 48 million in a day! What do you think it is monthly?
t1_dt2184r	1	*	even options arent gambling lol, what makes you think so?
t1_dt389ke	0	*	so, if someone works hard enough to save money in order to invest, they shouldn't be able to accumulate their wealth via compound interest and capital growth anymore?
t1_dt2my01	1	*	That's the median well outside the city  lol.   Inside the city average listing price is >$700k, with most homes going over $1 million.
t1_dt2it1k	1	*	I'm not following
t1_dt1rweq	0	*	Man, i don't think you get what income distribution is and how the rich has affected them. 
t1_dt1t8l6	0	*	I can think of a lot of things I'd do out of necessity that aren't in my best intrest in the long run. Necessity implies no actual choice, while acting in your best intrest implies another option.

t1_dt1tinr	0	*	depending on what you invested in and if the company went bankrupt or not. In short people did loose money, that is the bottom line, rather or not they made bad decision with their money
t1_dt69wve	1	*	1% is earning over $32k, that's not workaholic levels. 
t1_dt51nsp	0	*	Not saying that, i believe the article is true. But the reason to use that statistic it to say to the poor, 'lay off the rich, because you're rich and greedy too'. Which is bullshit.
t1_dt2mq8l	0	*	Because it needs a steady supply of new consumers.

t1_dug7pfx	0	*	But some edgy neckbeard virgin leeching off his 1st world government is telling you the real truth. You are just some highly educated guy who actually lives in Iraq what could you possibly know?
t1_dugnoic	1	*	The stance of thinking that a child cannot change is moronic, if you don't understand that children can be influenced (for better or worse) you truly are an idiot.
t1_dugnsg6	1	*	So you agree? Yes, those country did not want them in.  And yes she failed hugely and is not exactly popular.

t1_dukjrh7	0	*	Well, I guess one of the reasons is fact that american culture is very strong. We love stuff like Godfather and I think it makes some people interested when they see a cigar.

t1_dujb23y	0	*	I'm confused, do you want the above (French) website to counterbalance every condemnation of Russia's human rights records with an internal review?

t1_dul6gvz	0	*	So a shitty, backwards country likes a shitty backwards leader? Color me shocked.

t1_duj0ruu	0	*	Right, is this a common occurrence or did it happen once? Because if its the latter youd be able to say something similarly horrible about practically every country.
t1_dujdm6u	1	*	Without equating them? Or trying to suggest that condemnation of Russia is less valid because of other examples?
t1_duj43ki	0	*	Well, russian people have always been like that - kinda indifferent in daily life, but when shit hits the fan - we all unite. At least that is what impression I got from history books.
t1_dujfl4y	1	*	Noice! 
t1_dujnhv5	1	*	I'm saying it shouldn't if they're as conservatively Islamic as reddit makes them out to be.
t1_duj4cba	1	*	Good thing they can vote for a new leader to end their hardships instead of continuing to vote for the same guy.

t1_dumdfyh	1	*	Your people awaits you, over at voat.   Trump isn't trolling anyone, he's just incriminating himself.
t1_dsx8w66	0	*	Because you own an equel share of what your company produces, that's not stealing, companies paying people 1/10 of the wealth they produce for them is much closet to stealing.
t1_dswr6sc	0	*	Which part exactly is insane? Are you claiming socialism doesn't involve a command economy? Or that command economies don't require a commander?

t1_dsvht4r	0	*	You literally made that second number up. Great lies, best lies.   Edit: number is still wrong after edit
t1_dsuuyyr	1	*	Exactly, in denying the Haitian the opportunity to live and work, they're losing. I'm glad you can see that. In allowing them to work and achieve their potential it's a win for everyone.
t1_dsvahug	1	*	Saw that, thanks :P 
t1_dsv7zvl	0	*	I'm sorry these mouth breathers beat you up so bad for making an observation fun your home. Why don't you tour middle America then you don't have to tell us about movies

t1_dsvt5k5	1	*	Okay so basically, Haiti is a shithole but it is mean to say it is a shithole, so you just say it is poor, underdeveloped, with bad economy, high in corruption.  Sounds great!
t1_dsuzgwg	0	*	Facts do have relevance though. And you sound like an ass.
t1_dsusipx	0	*	Sure has failed Puerto Rico, but I digress.  So, you admit that it's purely spite.

t1_dsusabu	1	*	Do you think it had never changed?  That the laws, practices, standards, opinions, and customs surrounding immigration has remained static since we allowed people to emigrate here? 
t1_dsut1r3	1	*	I agree with you.
t1_dsw8pwl	1	*	You can also work above the table at walmart and still collect welfare :P  i mean, steal the job of some other potential walmart employee...

t1_dsushwl	0	*	I mean, if he banned *all* temporary work visas, it would be a lot less discriminatory-looking than banning a targeted country. That was his problem with the travel visas.
t1_dsvdd3i	0	*	How did it autocorrect to something that isn't a real word? 
t1_dsuwun8	1	*	Well.. assuming you're from the US, your country has had a boom in slavery since the 1970s.
t1_dsuwls4	1	*	Elaborate.
t1_dsv6ofy	1	*	I'm sure this should be obvious given the context, but then I've seen people say but what about [country] when someone made a statement clearly about the US several times in this thread.

t1_dsuspwt	1	*	Some legitimacy to claims would help

t1_dsuyf3k	1	*	Agreed.  Bring back Ellis Island immigration.

t1_dsuscwx	1	*	Well, too bad thats how you feel 
t1_dsvrrw1	0	*	You say that about Haitians that live here, which is a whole different thing. Why don't you go live in Haiti if Haitians are so great? I'm sure you'll be very safe, LOL.
t1_dsuqf6a	0	*	You must be buddies with half of congress.
t1_dsutwu4	1	*	Come again?
t1_dsusvah	0	*	You mean the money that is cited in the article I just linked?
t1_dsx6gpi	0	*	You can be proud of your countries accomplishments. You can be proud of your culture but to pretend that you inherently special because of where you were born is ridiculous. 
t1_dsurt5l	0	*	I guess his base is mostly unreachable but his disapproval rating has been steadily increasing. He's turning everyone outside his cult against him.
t1_dsurabn	1	*	Yeah the biggest problem with talking about _anything_ on the internet is the slew of unending word vomit completely unrelated to the actual point being made.

t1_dsvw5rm	1	*	Impeachment is NEVER gonna happen.
t1_dsutk9i	1	*	Do you have a source for that?   The studies I see from googling show that there is a minor or non exsistent  correlation between immigration and wages.
t1_dsusm62	1	*	it's not that it's offensive. It's just an idiotic line of logic to take. 
t1_dsvh5m2	0	*	Dude I live in Nxf8rrebro, Copenhagen where half the people are immigrants. I live next to immigrants and Walk With Them everyday. You have No Clue what you are talking about, clearly.
t1_dsv7nc3	0	*	Lol, whatever, numpty. Enjoy your semi autos and your processed fast food
t1_dsvg1oo	0	*	Oh fuck off, you have no intention of actually helping those people. It's just a convenient excuse for you to rationalize helping no one
t1_dsv4a0r	1	*	Your entire argument is trying to put words into somebody else's mouth. If you want to argue something differently, then make that point. Don't pretend the other person already did.
t1_dsv94cr	0	*	What about the 120,000 Canadians that overstayed their visas last year? Should we ban Canadian visas?
t1_dsuvd5k	0	*	The combined population of the 50 biggest cities is only about 47 million. There are around 323 million people in the US. I don't think this is giving the biggest cities all of the influence.  
t1_dsviezw	0	*	Idiot

t1_dsvz8yf	0	*	But California actively supports them by refusing to help ICE and never auditing them for labor standards.

t1_dt61y0n	1	*	like I said
t1_dt6ezkt	1	*	You have it backward. That stuff was written during the time of Abraham, and Abraham proselytized a lot (Jews don't do that anymore).
t1_dt6007q	0	*	> the Bahai are all about peace and unity though, AFAIK  tbqh isn't that how the other religions are sold at first blush?  
t1_dtt3un3	1	*	Nope. The opposite of free speech is anything that (get this) suppresses speech. That includes suppressing Nazi speech. 
t1_du73472	1	*	The Sinhala people came first, then the Tamils a few hundred years later. Who came first is irrelevant anyway, that was 2500 years ago.

t1_dsyoijd	0	*	Just google it. Or keep living in denial.

t1_dsvcelx	1	*	Yes, except that you don't have lots of people acting like it is anyway.
t1_dt8bbxx	1	*	It started way before that. In December 2008 the gop said if he was for it, they had to be against it. He wasnt even officially in office yet and they were planning no. 
t1_dspi4nt	1	*	Why are you so butthurt?
t1_dskhs3a	0	*	>Israel had 6 million of its people eliminated  ...what? Israel was founded AFTER the holocaust. There might not even have been one, if the state of Israel would've existed back then.

t1_dsxd283	1	*	In fairness Azov is only accessible by the Black Sea. Technically youre correct as Turkey could block traffic there, but the Black Sea is overall much more important.

t1_dtgfy1z	1	*	Lmao of course it's immigration. Fuck off you conservative prick
t1_dtg6dhe	0	*	That's because it dilutes the states power. That being said a state is free to apportion their electoral vote however they see fit. You can effect this by voting in state elections.

t1_dtgexgp	1	*	very USSR-like of them
t1_dth98xz	0	*	Still, it was a British colony.
t1_dtgfrl6	1	*	Not all of them will vote for him, basically if you have a university degree you won't vote again Berlusconi. That's what happens in my opinion. 
t1_dtggawk	1	*	By making the expression of any opposing opinion seem like an attempt to get a reaction from someone it actually makes it *easier* to dismiss such opinions and *strengthens* the circlejerk.
t1_dtg152d	0	*	Right I forgot empty tracts of land are more important than actual people.
t1_dti0zjo	0	*	Thats nit how culture works.
t1_dtg4ygf	1	*	Are you a tory supporter as well? Sorry to inform you but they're also a bunch of self-serving cunts.
t1_dtgg349	1	*	Yeah just saying people should be more x, without policies or ways to do this (other than talk to your friends and family, guys) is just idealistic malarkey.
t1_dtggprq	1	*	Australia then! Fantastic. I was under the impression that it might be slightly more racist in Australia, but the UK is working hard to catch up recently.
t1_dtgetu1	1	*	I voted for it and I dont regret it at all. 
t1_dtg6nt3	0	*	Show me an unbiased news source
t1_dtgzned	1	*	We tried the EU experiment with the Articles of Confederation here in the US.  It was an utter failure.  Stop repeating the same thing hoping for different results.
t1_dtgp86g	1	*	Focusing on the important things I see
t1_dtgf1sq	1	*	Im sure you believe in the Illuminati too. I have some votes in the shadow government I want to sell. It will get you some leverage. PM me for prices.

t1_dtgfpsa	1	*	Calling voting taking part is really a slap in the face
t1_dtgg056	1	*	Peoples growing distaste for the current political systems say otherwise. also, whoever makes that comic is a presumptuous cunt.
t1_dtg5g1m	0	*	Or.... that the Polish have the merits/financial support to go to England are the elite...
t1_dtgb6n7	1	*	We will need a supreme allied commander
t1_dtgf105	1	*	Too formal. Lets just be fuck buddies, where we are both ugly and nobody else seems to like us much, so we have a go at it. 
t1_dtgmbrf	0	*	I didn't know the Swiss did that.   They aren't just BS propaganda leaflets like I get in the mail? 
t1_dtgfjf8	0	*	No, see, we aren't benefiting from that.
t1_dtgxgdc	0	*	In other words, he made you feel good.  
t1_dtg8nwq	0	*	If I had to guess, I'd say because he fell for the trap of believing news that sounds too good to be true.  Once you start down that dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
t1_dtg8rga	1	*	Only in the mind of an idiot.
t1_dtg9d8p	1	*	This is so insightful. Thank you. 
t1_dtg5d4t	1	*	The fuck are you smoking
t1_dtgejao	1	*	You used a dumb satirical subreddit as your source lmaoooo
t1_dtg247o	1	*	Yeah, if you live in California, or Texas, or Alabama or any of the numerous safe states, there's little point in voting because everyone knows who is going to win that state.
t1_dtg502t	1	*	Staaand just a little bit closer.
t1_dtg4av8	0	*	More Scotts support remaining with the UK now than the Indyref result, and the SNP lost a lot of seats to the Tories in the 2017 GE. So why waste time and money on another referendrum?
t1_dtm377l	0	*	Or maybe I'm 5500 miles away, and have no damn idea what the fuck you're whining about.

t1_dtm27pk	0	*	We could if you linked it... 
t1_dtm1y45	1	*	That's because 95% of people that did it we're fucking morons about it. You don't chug a bottle of Everclear the first time you try drinking, y'know?
t1_dtm2vb2	0	*	Right? So easy to piss on something thats given the best living conditions ever without attempt to offer a better replacement.
t1_dttkexb	1	*	She didn't say it was trash, she said it needed improvements - and actually had details.

t1_dttzktj	1	*	More like Ellen Degeneres' deathbed
t1_dttzdo0	0	*	I didn't say you did, the original comment that you were comparing and relating to did. I'm not trying to be an ass, it was an honest question, no need to be trite and condensing

t1_dtu4yb9	1	*	Now that, I don't know.
t1_dtjtar9	1	*	People should listen to you.  
t1_dtkg6v3	1	*	The link did not have an example of yeah, nah  It's more of a long yeah with a quick nah  Yeeeaaah na
t1_dufjxbw	0	*	No, it's just that what you said isn't really what'll happen if we believe Jews will just leave. You haven't stopped them. They just left to do it elsewhere.
t1_dufzzra	0	*	You are defending the arguments for circumcision. Don't pretend that you're just here sitting on the fence now.
t1_dufhgl1	1	*	I already gave him three branches of government controlled by the GOP.  That's enough. 
t1_duhbxw6	0	*	If it felt different than it does now then that would be abnormal. Socks (of the clothing variety) are abnormal too but Im not giving them up either. 
t1_dufsylw	1	*	I bet they also like procol haram.
t1_dui0g6l	0	*	I am circumcised. Your the one talking about other people.
t1_dufn8ui	0	*	Fact: Less atheists = less atheist babies to be aborted.  Do the math.
t1_dsimidn	1	*	Does that metaphor assume that the American people didnt know about our interference in other democracies? Because we totally knew  
t1_dsjq84w	0	*	No rebuttal to actual points after revealing you dont even know what type of system the US, got it
t1_dsj9m1m	0	*	You could say the same about the states? I'm not saying all of Europe is to blame, but neither is a Americans. You're just muddying the waters with statements like these.
t1_dsitehq	1	*	Except this was a big deal before she lost, as was proven to you earlier. And you're currently trying to pretend you meant to ask why it wasn't reported before it fucking happened.
t1_dsiocx8	1	*	Make sure you lift with your legs when youre moving those goalposts.
t1_dsj8by4	0	*	Refusing to click on a link, see its from Chomsky and googling for the appropriate book does. Refusing all you tube no matter the content does as well, what if it was a video of an academic lecture?
t1_dsj900i	0	*	I benefit widely by this bill but I just care more about the less fortunate I guess. Youre way too concerned about your bank account balance rather than being a human being. To each their own though?
t1_dsins90	1	*	There are two baskets.  That doesn't mean the deplorable basket doesn't run ***deep***.
t1_du5p6ip	1	*	Animal lovers are hardcore.
t1_duc3d17	0	*	Why are you so focused on child porn? 
t1_dtk51ay	0	*	I don't think you even understand what people are saying... you're just hearing what you want to hear.
t1_dtke2kc	1	*	> Forcing women to not wear it, is literally oppression.  These women are already oppressed, a large number of them don't have a choice.
t1_dt2zkh4	0	*	Its not about whether you have an opinion, its about you having a strong opinion without knowing anything about the subject you are having an opinion on, which is dumb.

t1_ds9ywez	0	*	Yeah, I thought he was a reservist, so I was a little thrown because I know 22 SAS was the one that kicked ass at the Iranian Embassy.
t1_dsa3g2u	1	*	Then it's his North American right...
t1_dsa48my	1	*	Youre not even technically correct, the worst kind of incorrect.
t1_dsaucht	1	*	Now he's American he can take advantage of all that free healthcare if he hurts himself in the bush.  ...  Wait a minute...
t1_dsa2ekw	0	*	I'm talking about 'The Island' by Bear Grylls. The show the article is about..
t1_dsa9ib3	0	*	So is it only wrong to kill animals when it affects the gene pool?
t1_ds9zw2s	1	*	She's on an island in the middle of no where with no clean water or food, what's she gonna do, say no?

t1_dsa2992	1	*	One planted land animal. 
t1_dsaajor	0	*	Youre missing the point  were not debating the ethics of eating meat, were debating the authenticity of the show, given they planted the animal on the island.
t1_dsauu6w	1	*	Human animals spend a large portion of their life just sitting around... watching survivalist tv shows... typing Reddit comments...
t1_dsaaw08	1	*	Also it wasnt referred to as a bible college. It was a bible college. Thats what its called. 
t1_dsa16dz	1	*	Mmmm, [pool water](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/emergency-disinfection-drinking-water)
t1_dsjpf4w	0	*	Using raw numbers to determine newsworthiness is weird. 9/11 wasn't newsworthy as only 3,000 people were killed.  This is newsworthy *because* of what it says about Brexit.
t1_dtttuol	1	*	The law imposes prison sentences of up to 3 years for even mentioning the term Polish death camps. This is a fundamental freedom of speech issue.
t1_dsj1vqx	1	*	It's a buffoonish baboon. 
t1_ds5oqtv	0	*	Dude the CIA acknowledges installing the shah as a dictator by paying off strongmen and having them start a coup.

t1_dtskcnf	0	*	You mean you needed real money for that?
t1_dtdq6l8	1	*	Trump is a buffoon, but BoJay is following his act closely.
t1_dtdnd6o	0	*	To be fair, one is a generalization about a current set of people who have a set of traits.  The other one is saying that humans governing themselves is always about corruption. 
t1_dtdp7is	0	*	No... The Tories were literally founded with the mission statement of supporting the upper classes. 
t1_dtn2on2	0	*	Again as I mentioned the dossier was originated by Republicans. Democrats picked it up when Trump won the primary.
t1_dua9lja	0	*	Glorious Rebootition
t1_duasxn2	0	*	Use the word respectively in that case.   As to the sharp drop? I'm not exactly in a position to have stockpiles of foreign money in case I travel and I'd say that's hardly rare in the UK population 
t1_dua9giq	0	*	That is also my logic, but people like to feel like they are doing something.  Currently jkldh;lksuiogu;'sfg: Do you want to do something or do nothing?
t1_dubg7mm	0	*	The cheapest way to get yogurt is to make it yourself, and you're looking at 150 for 1L milk.
t1_dubu0sw	1	*	Anything helps though. And to be honest, we usually buy cheese at IKEA already. Decent cheese at very good price.
t1_duak8t5	0	*	What constituent country is your spouse from?   BTW, saying you can get a visa to go there and saying that you have the right to stay when already there are two completely different things. 
t1_dua6dh8	0	*	Very expierenced in being a lying cunt? Like all politicians including Trump? Yeah mate, they are the same. 
t1_dua73qq	1	*	You sure misunderstand me a lot eh! Sorry I don't have the energy to hold your hand and explain everything again.
t1_duat3nq	1	*	He's not going to respond. I don't like Trump but I hate retarded Democrats even more.
t1_dua5il1	1	*	> still convinced that there are no good anti-EU arguments despite being outvoted.  A majority of people voting for something does not prove that there are good arguments for it.
t1_duag2ks	1	*	I meant legitimacy in the eyes of the world, not Little-Englanders
t1_dua81zh	1	*	That's a retarded view.
t1_dua8xhn	0	*	We all just wake up one day naked at an intact Stonehenge with no recollection of the past 2000 years. I can dig it. Can we get Italy to reboot too though, I don't want Romans harshing my buzz.
t1_duabi2y	0	*	It's propaganda because it didn't mesh with my preconceived notions, therefore this is everyone's faults!
t1_duafp57	0	*	Felt in what way? Be specific. You don't think new trade deals can be negotiated?
t1_duaiu8q	1	*	The Socrates method at work ;)
t1_dudsbxv	0	*	It's obvious what I'm saying. Don't even attempt to insert words into what I said. That was extremely intellectually dishonest of you Cathy. https://imgur.com/wqyaqP1
t1_dua8vgy	0	*	Ah ok, thanks :)   To clarify I was just hazarding a guess as to why it might not be a situation Japan is not in a position to exploit britain, rather than that being a real life concrete example.

t1_duacwva	0	*	Thank you. Good luck believing the UK is done for. Glad Im not as pessimistic as you

t1_dst7q55	1	*	Some of its true at least.   I doubt Trump going ape shit on Bannon, Bannon apologizing, and Bannon losing his job all happened because of fake news.

t1_dsplqzp	1	*	So then your response to santa is irrelevant since you can't think outside the box. He's arguing about the morality of it, not the legality. 
t1_dspjrup	1	*	Child pornography is defined as the filming of anyone under the legal age of 18. No matter how many times you try to deny this. 
t1_dspllov	1	*	And they are being treated as juveniles if they are juveniles.  Sheesh.  You need to learn the difference between a status offense and a regular crime.

t1_duxa6rm	1	*	Well when there is only one party and no option for a change then it becomes a regime now the president is president for life. 
t1_dtknngz	1	*	Why do I bother to deal with someone who has no idea what it's like there? 
t1_dtir5o8	1	*	idk why youre getting downvoted. pretty accurate 
t1_ds8kfdj	1	*	Again, does not prove anything.  
t1_dusn9tq	0	*	Yup. Because embracing the anti fascists worked so well for the USSR didn't it. It's not like millions died of starvation, thousands murdered and tends of thousands dying in gulags.

t1_dsz2gop	1	*	Apparently it worked. Thanks for proving my point.
t1_dsyus9c	0	*	Because they were so accurate in determining the winner of the election.  Obviously something in their models was not capturing all the variables correctly.

t1_dt6y86m	0	*	How does Delaware make it easier to do Ireland?
t1_dt6wkx7	0	*	Thats misleading, iirc: the tax code contains everything that had gone before. If you were to change the law to Fuck it, ten percent, that would still technically make it longer.

t1_dsql886	0	*	I haven't appealed at all. I was also rejected for unemployment. :(
t1_dtlfaq4	1	*	Not at all changing the definition to suit my argument but the definition itself was arbitrary to behin with and serves no goog sociological purpose.
t1_dtl0i08	1	*	We tend not to hold children to the same account as adults
t1_duphp3j	0	*	Ha. And I will gladly become a teacher for that! Make it happen!
t1_dupc9bj	0	*	That makes sense, but maybe to reduce accidents with kids still learning muscle control, we give 9/10 kids blanks. So the teachers know that a few kids in the class are packing real heat.
t1_du4gsc6	1	*	Competition and socialism [aren't mutually exclusive](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/32722/why-did-the-soviet-union-have-multiple-airplane-manufacturers).

t1_dsmkpiz	0	*	Shhh, don't ruin my fraud dreams.
t1_duqa763	0	*	Yep. You can look up what the FBI has for a definition of sexual assault.  It conflates rape, with things that totally aren't and makes talking about these things maddening
t1_duprdn6	1	*	Fully agree. The only way to tackle problems is with truth and fact. 
t1_duq4o7a	0	*	that's fine!  thank you for being reasonable

t1_dtrtuuf	1	*	You think we should have continued with conventional bombs? What does it do to your opinion when I tell you the Tokyo fire bombs had more casualties than either nuke?
t1_dtsvdw5	1	*	Excuses. Japan extended peace feelers. There wasn't any peace to feel.  The United States accepted one of those four conditions. You can't tell me how much blood each of the other three were worth.
t1_dtr5mdz	1	*	Roughly 400,000-500,000 causalities in the first six months were the best estimates if an invasion had occured.
t1_dtrmq4i	0	*	The problem is that its hard to *not* hit civilians when your enemy's solution to the whole factories are being bombed issue is to move production into residential homes.   
t1_dtre26l	0	*	Hubris and underestimating enemies is always a good idea.    Also, South Korea is not a member of NATO. The clue can be found in the name, North Atlantic while Korea is in the Pacific.
t1_duj8w5i	1	*	How clever you must imagine yourself.
t1_dsqmkq0	1	*	Well, it would make referenda basically impossible to win, so that's a good thing.

t1_dugr4r5	0	*	The word legal wasn't used. Irrelevant lawyering.
t1_dtbcy7y	1	*	That's not the reason lol.  It is in the US interest that it is international waters so its own shipping can use it free of charge.
t1_duffaog	1	*	I think what's being referred to is a glorified version of homlessness, like a nomadic gypsy traveller scavenger i met once. 
t1_dsm22r2	1	*	As a non-American, leader of the free world is absolute bullshit.  Americans are not free. 
t1_dslvp66	0	*	The user you just ripped into when they were adding to your point.
t1_dttxi4i	0	*	Lol so because they were too pathetic to succeed we should give them a free pass. According to you if someone attempts a murder they shouldn't go to jail because they did not succeed. 
t1_dt8kv0u	0	*	It is not misleading.  It was expected there would be an extension.  It was up to Trump to choose whether or not to extend it.  It is newsworthy regardless of which option he chose to take.

t1_dt89ho1	0	*	Blue Origin's tourism rocket doesn't actually go into space, LEO is out of the question.  It is an up/down vehicle, to get to space you have to go horizontal.  The Virgin project is similar.

t1_dsmn0vc	1	*	No, that wasn't what my answer meant... 
t1_dsnivsw	1	*	There is bounds of pretty direct evidence.
t1_dsovds4	1	*	That's why you base the company in a country with very friendly tax and financial privacy laws. Most times, its completely possible to hide who actually owns a private company
t1_dtrq9qe	0	*	OK well we are talking about pharma marketing RX drugs (see my source quoted above), your inability to follow a conversation is not my problem.  Seek help.

t1_dsokegq	1	*	The Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to rejoin the Russian Federation.
t1_dv1rltj	1	*	The transition couldn't be done instantly anyway. Technology advances quickly.
t1_dt9p5j2	0	*	Arab Christians use the word Allah, so your claim that it's the Islamic God is false.
t1_dug5jx9	1	*	I don't deny that, but I do object to the original commenter implying that all the Americans are defending the CIA.

t1_dtk8ky3	1	*	I mean yes, usually people are not trying to cure cancer of things that will kill it so much as trying to cure the people who have cancer though...  If that was already the joke, I'm sorry

t1_dtkctal	1	*	I think wil smith stared in the cancer cure gone wrong film. 
t1_dun3vu8	1	*	No, just El Al, probably. They're known for paranoid and unusual security arrangements (and I kind of understand why).  Flights to the US also have extra screening on European airports.

t1_dt5d3a9	1	*	You know what? Tobacco companies have been banned from taking such actions according to the TPP. It's actually an improvement over existing trade agreements.
t1_dt5alvw	1	*	Quebecer, but not de souche: found it very funny, but maybe more French from France. Jean-Guy Charbonneau would prolly b more accurate. Not sure if I count tho.

t1_dt5dcw3	0	*	But it's good for me.
t1_dt5fb86	1	*	The American political system necessitates massive quantities of cash to win any public office. It was no surprise America had a choice between two 1 percenters for their Presidential election.
t1_dt56bex	0	*	Oh yeah it's way better now that the world has moved on without the US. We're all so upset at the starkly positive direction the country is going in.
t1_dt5jy95	0	*	Yep. Had +7xb0c and -30xb0c in the same day. We are getting there, just some minor stalling, like todays Rain.

t1_dt531gq	0	*	Arrogant Worms
t1_dt6dw0k	0	*	I think that properly conducted opinion polling is a completely valid way to measure the mood of the public, particularly when it shows very wide differences well outside the margin of error.

t1_dv0ltor	0	*	hmm this is your opinion here. I still find those videos kinda traumatizing, can't imaging what would happend in the head of a kid watching them.

t1_dv0mg28	0	*	Sorry for not being an English mothertounge. But if that is your best comeback, I know that you truely must have *really* good arguments.
t1_dv1ifg1	0	*	I am familiar.  Jean Marie Le Pen is not being charged, however.  Or do you believe that people should be charged for the opinions of their parents?
t1_dv0rh0y	0	*	Y'all also had a bad dose of communism over there too, but that hasn't changed anything.  Also, it's really ironic that y'all are using the fascist idea of restricting free speech to combat fascism.
t1_dv0xtls	1	*	Tell that to law enforcement in SF!
t1_dv0y1f3	0	*	It actually wasn't a rhetorical question in this context, no.

t1_dv0zcyv	1	*	yea I'm not sure about the laws. I just figured it was included in obscenity. The media seems to do most of the censorship on its own here.
t1_dtwee1o	0	*	I disagree. Flying to the moon is brave. Starting a car company and a rocket company with less than 10% success rate is impressive. I admire both.

t1_dsi1sxk	1	*	Well, their president is in a shady business with Russia, apparently. 
t1_dshujxi	0	*	Thats fine. Just wanted confirmation that Cold War 2.0 is what we want as a people. This time though I think itll have a lot more major players than just US vs Russia. 
t1_dshp4gs	0	*	The fucking irony in this is amazing. 
t1_dsi0uqf	0	*	Not everyone, but a lot of people. I think the success of Fox News, a non news network, is a testament to America's lack of critical thought.

t1_dshqila	1	*	Lmao 
t1_dshvmyy	1	*	I'd still go with the 1953 US govt vs the 1953 USSR government. I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it was still better than the Eastern Bloc governments.

t1_dshssi7	1	*	I heard Irkutsk's lovely this time of year.
t1_dsi0o11	1	*	Yeah I don't know man. People in other replies seem to think Canada doesn't engage in international political espionage because its citizens say sorry a lot
t1_dshwo4u	1	*	And with their propagandizing I'm sure some actual inhabitants of those countries come around to their worldview and can be recruited.

t1_dsifw53	1	*	The government refers to the majority party... Maybe you didnt know that?   Not to be a pedant, but engaging a corrupt politician is not the same as interfering with an election. 
t1_dshsztp	0	*	Okay, that's fine. I'm not trying to be combative with you. I'm just trying to let you know that without any perimeters that comment could easily be taken as whataboutism.

t1_dssdhgz	0	*	From their view are they not fighting for the sake of God? If they think that's true then wouldn't suicide bombing just be laying your life in Gods war? 
t1_dssqvl6	1	*	You just made an enemy for life!
t1_dssqx48	0	*	I feel like you are conflating Muslims with the doctrines of Islam. 
t1_dsspfkw	1	*	It's even more akin to calling the US California or Texas. While they are some of the most well known parts of the country, they are but part of the whole.
t1_dteeh7e	0	*	So, racism is indoctrinated into American society, then.  Comparing now to 50 years ago does not equate to racism not being indoctrinated into American society.
t1_du75mgg	1	*	Lol, what? 
t1_du7l9rl	1	*	> but he was too busy ~~doing other shit~~ being an 80's guy that he forgot to get treated.  FTFY

t1_dsnetmq	0	*	And you were told that by the same party that nominated donald trump. It amazes me that people can see through a lot of his bs, but even a lot of liberals believe what he said about hillary.

t1_du4crnm	1	*	Apparently in Urban Dictionary #2 explanation for fucking moron is The Secret Service codename for Donald Trump.
t1_du4740z	1	*	It's not that they aren't allowed to use the internet. It's too expensive for most people to have in their homes right now. Most of them get wifi cards and can use it at public hotspots. 
t1_du4gilz	1	*	Yes, that's a better way of putting it
t1_dumwc44	1	*	Such as?
t1_du4f9qe	0	*	What you've just described is even less shady. This reverse whataboutism you guys are trying is super weird.

t1_ds69lqn	1	*	If you can't handle him at his worst, you don't deserve him at his best.
t1_ds5jkol	1	*	The fact that there is corruption and outsized influence for the wealthy in every society does not mean that those problems are of the same degree in every society, far from it.

t1_dsiqeph	0	*	>Don't be pretentious.  I think its more pretentious to assume my opinion on where I would want to spend vacation is wrong.  Good luck with whatever you got going on inside that head.
t1_dshhwvz	1	*	Tell that to everyone who has their life savings in Ben Franklin rather than their home country. 
t1_dsipypf	1	*	This is a factor, however, my argument is not totally symmetric. English has a simpler written form which has a direct correspondence with its spoken form.

t1_dtsvvc1	1	*	They have to. There's no other choice besides walking away or continuing to lose. Eventually they'll have nothing left to bargain with and Israel will just tell them to fuck off.

t1_dsb667u	1	*	Honestly didnt know about the TPP until Trump pulled out. I will say though that you can find fault with something yet not find the answer to be killing the whole thing. 
t1_dsbbi6z	1	*	So is the wall going to do much about the fact that most illegals enter the country by plane on a valid visa which they then overstay?

t1_dujj6qd	1	*	Use the truth and don't give them something to strawman. That's how they invalidate everything you've said/written. And people believe it
t1_dtxj6z2	0	*	They literally didn't want to colonise NZ. NZ had to actually ask them to come and take over.  jej
t1_dtxm5u9	1	*	Nature tries to kill us in other ways - I woke up this morning to -30C and snowing so hard you could barely see. 
t1_dtxft5g	1	*	And water, in much of the country. Likely to get worse too.
t1_dtxfxw4	1	*	Also it has to be noted that Polish is basically Eastern-European to many in the UK so when they complain about The Polish they generally mean all Eastern European countries
t1_dtxdmwg	1	*	Germany and France have high wages meaning there isn't mass immigration into the UK unlike with Poland.

t1_dtxdzom	0	*	States directly vote for thier own governors 
t1_dtxk4h4	0	*	It's not just ROI-NI, though, but ROI-UK. You don't need a passport for a flight from Cork to Birmingham or the ferry from Dublin to Holyhead.
t1_dtxg7tn	1	*	A better life as long as they find work and can adjust to the new country. Is a big gamble. 
t1_dtxe7ge	1	*	It's hypothetical
t1_dty81kw	1	*	No I wasn't really comparing. It seemed like you were saying that old chestnut white people have no culture
t1_dtxfubb	0	*	What if it's not supposed to be a minimum wage job, and is only a minimum wage job because immigrants will accept minimum wage to do it?

t1_dtxfi9w	0	*	Yeah someone told me if you hook up in Banff or Whistler you better wrap yourself in cling film. 
t1_dtxas8f	1	*	Depends where you go. The south island is basically northern Europe levels of pure white; the north island is very diverse.
t1_dtxdzuv	0	*	Depends on where you're from, in Scotland near the northeastern airbases we've had polish communities since the forties
t1_dsx3rjn	1	*	Not with that attitude they arent.
t1_dsx2ni6	0	*	That's why we have the charter
t1_dswo8oi	1	*	It has not been decriminalized in Canada federally, it has merely been conveniently ignored (or enforced, depending on your perspective).
t1_dswlite	0	*	Such as it is, they've now made the matter Crystal clear. However, beforehand, it was unstated and perhaps misleading.
t1_dswko98	1	*	fucking lol
t1_dswptie	0	*	Murder is not a legal technicality.  Do you quibble also with the title of that famous war-crime video, Collateral Murder?
t1_dswukar	1	*	It proves your point of being solidified in your position? Ok. 
t1_dswmmch	1	*	Im gonna need a source ok that, especially if you consider kids for adoption solely in the US since so many come from overseas
t1_dswknyq	0	*	Ya I get it, I know what you're saying. But you know what? If you're anti-abortion, fuck you. 
t1_dswyet5	0	*	What Hitler did was legal in Germany,  so it must've been okay then by your logic. 
t1_dswn1j8	0	*	There is nothing in the law that says you need to promote or support abortion.  You seem to completely misunderstand what this change actually says.
t1_dsx11mp	0	*	Could be there is less stigma around abortion in Canada, so women may not wait that late to have the procedure done. I bet they have birth control and sex education programs too.
t1_dsx0zci	1	*	Use a sock.
t1_dswnoqd	0	*	Tell that to all the people who's lives were ruined because of drunk drivers.
t1_dswu7h2	1	*	20 weeks is the cut off for most abortions. After 20 weeks requires a hospital and a medical reason.   In Canada, anyway. 
t1_dswsjh4	0	*	Ok so you're against morning after pills. Are you religious? Out of interest.  And what do you mean by comment delay?  
t1_dswuf5f	1	*	Too bad Canadian citizenship isnt revoked for racism. 
t1_dswv80u	0	*	At that point you become a mass murderer everytime you jerk off since each sperm cell could in theory become a person...
t1_dswp2ns	1	*	We should not be giving them false hope and taking their money just so that thousands of teachers can graduate ever year and vie over what, maybe a hundred positions. It's just wrong. 
t1_dswmvn7	1	*	It applies in a great many circumstances, but in the case discussed here specifically it applies with regards to federal employees and federal funding. 
t1_dswpuoe	0	*	>your argument is that it's okay to restrict what women remove from their own uteri.  This is my argument when we are talking about a living human, yes.
t1_dsybnko	1	*	Not sure about that, but they do bomb clinics and kill doctors.
t1_dswxa51	1	*	This situation quite literally could not happen in Canada 
t1_dswpn8e	0	*	Spoken like true, well educated person.
t1_dswp4ud	0	*	There is no fucking argument. You're just spewing utter nonsense. 
t1_dswptq8	1	*	My point wasn't to argue that pro-life is right and pro-choice is wrong. I originally started by explaining that neither side is objectively wrong.
t1_dswt5t9	1	*	hence the regulation of opinions. You are saying some groups get stuff because they agree with the current power's beliefs. 
t1_dsxjxn1	0	*	Nope. not that I know of. You apply for a permit to do so. And handguns are even more restricted, with snub-nosed and others prohibited that you can only get through inheritance.
t1_dsyo3kz	1	*	That's what I said in my first comment, they should change the wording.
t1_dswmcwv	0	*	Religious couples are overwhelmingly more likely to adopt than non-religious

t1_dswmlp9	0	*	You have fuck all lmao, keep crying as the cells die.  
t1_dswz6h2	1	*	>HER OWN BAD JUDGEMENT  So what if it was an accident? You're fine with an abortion then? They could use good judgement and still end up pregnant. Why do you want to punish women for having sex?
t1_dswr9cw	0	*	Hating gay people is not a matter of simply disagreeing with someone. 
t1_dswzn2s	0	*	Exception: Quebec
t1_dsx0za7	1	*	::sigh::  There is so much wrong with that comment. But its 5:00am, and I dont have the energy to deal with it.  Peace.
t1_dswtrzm	1	*	Ds had a strong candidate trying to win and a pre-ordained me turn candidate who was expecting to win. We are so lucky that the worst of both primaries made it to the general election.
t1_dsxahms	1	*	I completely agree.
t1_dsx06tu	0	*	It's a bit trickier than that.  The Magna Carta was actually ignored for a while after it's signing, before being enforced again later.
t1_dswomav	1	*	 It's a joke mate, if it's dissected and explained it loses all effect. To answer your question, more possibility of blowjobs.
t1_dswpgxi	0	*	>HER OWN BAD JUDGEMENT that caused the pregnancy  How do you know this was the case?  
t1_dsy7as3	1	*	So that would be you can't come up with any examples.  Okay then.

t1_dswp6im	1	*	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you. I was just trying to help.
t1_dswwg0s	0	*	 This actually isn't technically true. The Bill of Rights 1689 means she can't dispense of or execute laws without consent of Parliament. 
t1_dsx6dg7	0	*	Nope.
t1_dswkfad	1	*	Zygotes arent the only thing you can abort, at least in america, you can abort fetuses.
t1_dsyc8i2	1	*	A day and a Norwegian soul, I guess.
t1_dswojyr	0	*	Exactly. And that makes it pretty clear that, like a lot of groups these days, they don't truly believe in (or think about) what they preach. 
t1_dsxkpte	1	*	If he's the worst that recent Canadian history can offer, I think I can live with it.
t1_dswp2j0	1	*	If only more people would listen to reason and make an informed choice like you did here, instead of people drawing a hard line in the sand. Talking to people nowadays would be so much better.
t1_dswoai6	1	*	Not a very scientific way of determining that. Very subjective and hard to measure.  More philosophical, which is why the study of consciousness and identity typically falls under that cloth. 
t1_dswqfws	0	*	I don't see anything wrong with it.
t1_dswqfg0	0	*	Lol who TF is going to invade Canada? Your statement is absolutely absurd. 
t1_dswwhgm	1	*	The Canadian govt only participated in the vietnam war as peacekeepers...
t1_dswnldp	0	*	>But they don't want/aren't ready to have the kid.  That can be equally true when the child is at any age.
t1_dswpixn	0	*	You think the viewpoint of not supporting the killing of children is unrealistic, idealistic, and ignorant?
t1_dswwfpg	0	*	The electoral college only ever seems to be a problem for whoever loses then they shut up about it when they win.
t1_dsxe3dc	1	*	No, it isn't. I'm against abortion and I'm agnostic. 
t1_dswqgp9	1	*	Why are you polling Americans when its a Canadian policy...  We also have significantly less people that think the planet is 8,000 years old.
t1_dswn5tr	1	*	> In summary, I didnt like him and would never vote for him, but I didnt hate him.  Must be nice...
t1_dswp64g	0	*	No human being has the right to live at the expense of another human being.  Child support is either a fine for having sex, or a human being's right to live at the expense of another. 
t1_dswl6wn	0	*	Is a seed a tree?
t1_dswsyft	0	*	They're forming in straight line

t1_dsxw4uk	0	*	Abortions are generally fatal for one party involved. 
t1_dswzkn5	0	*	I dont know what your referring to. The guy above was alluding to the difficulties in governing a large, diverse nation. No mention of Canada. 
t1_dsx1b4g	0	*	Not getting free money from the government is not discrimination. Take your bullshit christian persecution complex somewhere else
t1_dswswto	1	*	Not as hard as learning another language or, I suppose, for an English-speaker to learn a foreign one. 
t1_dsxz2fd	1	*	It withdraws funding from religious organisations far more than any other kind of organisation.
t1_dswod13	0	*	Yes, this was awful.
t1_dswzkdd	1	*	You don't know that.  Maybe they just thought it was funny, I blew air out my nose at it.
t1_dswmd4n	0	*	Wait what is this link supposed to be? It sure as shit isnt changing your unnecessary dramatizing of statistics
t1_dsx1iw7	1	*	I think you should actually look up the statistics for abortions in countries where it's illegal. The rate of abortions *doesn't go down at all*.
t1_dswnu3k	0	*	Can you please not slide an already stretched analogy to increasingly absurd levels and stick to the core idea?
t1_dswowpu	1	*	Only if the life support is another person's body.   Edit: Think Mad Max blood bags.

t1_ds1b70q	0	*	Never used a deodrant. Human beings are supposed to smell.
t1_ds123xa	0	*	Facebook is not US-based in Europe. It's an Irish company thanks to the fact that Facebook wants to share taxes. Technically the USA have nothing to do with this.

t1_duytv3x	1	*	How is that relevant?
t1_dsmeqpg	0	*	Well, that got weird quickly. 
t1_dus3nul	1	*	I cant speak for other countries. I dont know if they care or not, but I think its just because they dont want to deal with the type of leader Hun Sen is. Exhibit A: Threatening to beat up Australians
t1_dusdvt9	1	*	> Some kids do that in Australia too, mate.  I don't know what bogan part of australia you live in, but i live here in SA and i've never once seen a kid try to wash windows of cars in traffic.

t1_duuohc3	1	*	Rich smart Republicans aren't on the_donald, they're funding fox news and lobbying politicians. Anyone on the_donald is either a troll, bot, or someone lacking critical thinking skills 
t1_duue10g	1	*	I can definitely see how it might come across differently too, cheers.

t1_ds87oae	1	*	I have no problem with people refuting it. I'd honestly like to see honest replies. But just posting cringe is lame af. 
t1_ds94tnn	1	*	They want to maintain american economic domination, because they dont want to get shafted like they have been doing to everybody else.
t1_dt9fy4k	1	*	Because thats actually illegal. Notice how Trump never uses these people even though he could? All he does is get you to believe its lies because thats as far as he can go without being proven wrong.
t1_dt9i8y2	1	*	How do I make that nifty little META word sculpture on here? 
t1_dt9o955	1	*	Yeah, that's where I stand.  I completely oppose most of his policies, but he has some logic to him.  I feel like at least with Pence, we can regain some allies

t1_ds635kk	1	*	He didn't try very hard. Look how Hafez Al Assad quelled the previous Syrian revolution attempt. At least we should have killed Khomeini in France as soon as the unrest started.

t1_dsl36zj	1	*	How would you like to run FEMA?
t1_dsjiejg	0	*	I'm not defending idiots, but this whole us vs. them ideology is pretty big part of US's problems IMO. If you blame everything on your enemies, it's easy to dismiss your own mistakes.

t1_durv74k	1	*	We don't even have truly free speech in Canada. We are currently trying to push for a law that could land you in jail for misgendering someone. That's not freedom.

t1_duhxr7e	1	*	Not like we're in a scientific environment though, is it?  Common parlance, hyperbole can be, and is, used.
t1_duig3tg	0	*	If you had prevented immigration, the economy would be heading into a dumpster fire because of the lack of young workers.  See: Japan
t1_duhv7gl	0	*	at first i was cross with you but now u have melted my heart ;D

t1_dtt6hru	1	*	There's a bit of a selection bias going on there unless you met those folks in Iran.  We're also talking about the 40s and 50s here, so it was quite a while ago.
t1_dtu5sy2	0	*	That's like saying a quarter is worth relatively more then a penny. Its missing the point that its not ten dollars.

t1_duysx15	0	*	There's a line that's undeniably too far: taking away a people's rifles and handguns. Then we are powerless. We nees to protect the power that we the people have.

t1_duy6kmp	1	*	It's not a coincidence that the only country on earth that considers guns to be a right is the only country that has regular mass shootings.
t1_duyf8tt	0	*	> This ban is absolute stupidity.  Well, we Norwegians think otherwise. We ban the guns BEFORE they become an issue.

t1_ds6h87n	0	*	Thats right. A place that tells you what you want to hear will sell more of their product.  Correct.
t1_ds7022f	0	*	Or you know, you're in a minority opinion? Perhaps we shouldn't get bent out of shape over natural occurrences like death and suicide because they prevents constructive conservation? 
t1_ds6k4ur	0	*	Ooooo gett'em
t1_ds6n3b7	0	*	Which of your opinions should be censored?  Or do you, in a huge coincidence, have only the 'correct' opinions

t1_ds6f1l2	0	*	It's gotten really bad ever since 2016 because, well, *you know*.  Even boards that have nothing to do politics have gotten hit by a certain other board's posters and shitposting.
t1_ds8e9bw	1	*	We're supposed to be upset that people aren't getting paid for making Youtube videos?

t1_dshsjjf	0	*	Then the boss will just shut down the location and make a new one two store fronts down.  It's definitely cheaper to fire everyone and relocate than it is to deal with a union.
t1_dsi1jvh	1	*	unions here in canada is why the Oshawa GM plant died / is dying this year, and why the city of oshawa is fucked.
t1_dsim5md	1	*	Just say Walmart.
t1_dshezz4	1	*	I don't think it's a dirty word. But conservatives have managed to denegrate them quite a bit. 
t1_du9m7s4	0	*	She did assault a soldier, yes.   Her motive - provoking a response for propaganda - is irrelevant. 
t1_dtxybzb	1	*	The problem is you were just proven wrong when you cited the reason we pulled out of the deal. You can look this shit up. The policy stance is made public. Stop being a numbnut.

t1_dtx4tlh	0	*	Damn... wait what? The comment thread you replied to literally already agreed that the Paris agreement didn't actually do anything, it was just the stance he applauded?
t1_dtvk46r	1	*	Where the hell did you get climate change from? Lol echo chamber, the pot calling the kettle black.

t1_dtw22xe	0	*	I dont think you know what a technocrat is.
t1_dtvkjnc	1	*	Its literally no worse then it was 8 years or even 16 years ago if you were under the poverty line. That's why it's called poverty, and guess what, it's not indigenous to the US.
t1_dtvy031	0	*	Don't be betting on the wrong horse. Time for the US to correctly occupy its spot in the 3rd world.
t1_dtw2m4l	1	*	Ah I get it. So that South park joke about having to choose between a douce or a turd is a ref to this!

t1_dul5qxj	1	*	>  they will never win  They have already won
t1_dt2w8an	1	*	And I assert that's not a meaningful statistic, for reasons I've explained elsewhere in this thread.
t1_dt4bi7o	1	*	I meant to say it's not the same thing as money. Typo.
t1_dud19g7	0	*	That's a fair point. I am by no means saying capitalism is a bad solution, it's the best we have.
t1_dudmbj4	0	*	And Communism *isn't* corrupt as fuck? Jesus Christ, come on.

t1_dsc4em8	0	*	The US didn't start bombing North Vietnam till near the end of the war. Would have helped a lot more earlier on.
t1_dsbtkxl	1	*	Let's not pretend they're the same. Republicans are worse by far.

t1_dsc5c9n	0	*	> well before the Greenland / Iceland meme was a thing  That has *always* been a thing. Some theories say that they were named that way to confuse invaders.
t1_dsbyv7v	0	*	I can't understand your post because your English is so bad. Not much logic needed to realize that. 
t1_dsbopee	0	*	That's a silly opinion to have. Just because political groups are smaller doesn't make it any less a war when they get together and fight to the death.

t1_dv056cl	1	*	 to be efficient would require them to actually run.
t1_dv00et4	1	*	That's because most of them got the fuck out when everything turned to shit after the apartheid ended.  Many of the ones who remained kept hoping things would get better.
t1_duzzsdj	1	*	Venezuela used to produce food. After the government switch is when the oil dependent economy became worst, business and land expropriation started, and the whole implosion we know today came to life.

t1_dv0ln1r	1	*	Glad we cleared that up. The colonizers accidentally killed the native Americans by bringing disease. Besides that they had good intentions right? 
t1_dv0poka	1	*	Oh, I never meant to say they're the same. I just think it's dangerous to not include both definitions in the root word, hence a term like systemic or cultural racism
t1_dv0mjbh	0	*	How do you win Hearts and minds by blocking traffic ?  I can understand using tactic as sort of threat. This is what we do if  you dont submit to our demands. but how it is winning hearts and minds ?
t1_dv02orc	1	*	Yeah forcing people to sell their land is called eminent domain... and doing it on a large scale is nationalization.

t1_dv0147i	1	*	I'll send the cat food.
t1_dv005xb	1	*	Well, don't we need to factor in international support? Also, I can't believe that entire African population would turn on these people, these are people who have lived their entire lives there. 
t1_duzzick	0	*	And then everyone clapped
t1_duzy000	0	*	Even using 'new definition' of racism this absolutely fits the bill.
t1_duzyk0u	1	*	I never said i agree with it.
t1_dv00652	1	*	You underestimate whites.  Generally speaking, thats a bad idea.
t1_dv05uzf	1	*	After you see what he actually looks like, it becomes very obvious why most of his pictures are in black and white only.
t1_duzyats	0	*	Somehow I bet your sources on that are a little weaker than literal video.  So I'd say its safe to say, south africa is without a doubt worse than north korea.
t1_dv07tu4	0	*	Wasn't just Canada, they got turned back by a bunch of countries, including the US. The story is quite tragic.

t1_dv03679	0	*	Yes exactly thats cool, these farmers don't deserve this at all.  I just would like it if people respected everyone suffering regardless of race. Antifa has pretty much died down, as they should.
t1_dv0xjcp	0	*	Did you not have world history in high school? You should have learned major events throughout history. Things that directly changed the world even though they may have happened continents away.

t1_dv00ugk	0	*	That doesn't make you an expert. And you're still wrong despite being African. 
t1_dv006wq	1	*	I want to know the story now but not having a lot of luck. Turns out there were quite a few Kulaks named Grigoriy. Could you throw a link or a last name?
t1_duzzj8m	0	*	That is a far stretch.  I don't think I personally know anyone that would equate the two.  
t1_dv009fi	0	*	Personally, I value water and food over employment.
t1_duzxaox	0	*	That wasnt the question
t1_dv0fdc8	1	*	Economically, you are correct. But currently that is the only clout they have and even then they have to tread carefully

t1_du8de7i	1	*	We elect a company as president and like Miley Cyrus said You've got the best of both worlds.
t1_du831zs	0	*	Then that's an issue with capital control, not taxing revenue as the person I replied to stated.  Capital control is completely different conversation than taxation.
t1_du8i3lf	1	*	Youd be incentivised to pay a bit more on higher rent thats true, but whats wrong with that? It wouldnt suddenly mean you can double your rent.

t1_ds9u6t3	1	*	Berlin is a beautiful dog name. Im going to remember that. 
t1_ds8gjsa	1	*	No, but we shouldn't be making people breed that have a high chance of having a child with a deformity.   Actually, we shouldn't be *making* people breed at all.
t1_ds8plwa	0	*	Reasonable living is one of the best things about this state. Kentucky is not bad as long as you avoid conversation with most people. 
t1_ds99w5q	0	*	What advantage does the golden doodle provide that makes a normal poodle a bad choice?
t1_dsedd0q	1	*	I agree, I just jumped into this, I'm not even the guy that made the comment.
t1_ds1797l	0	*	You just gave the Queen 1 more day to live! She will not die before 2185-08-14  Reddit has given the Queen 88 days to live!
t1_dstsuns	1	*	Fair point.
t1_dttb4vf	0	*	Prevalent and legally allowed are completely different things.
t1_dttns9l	1	*	The fact that you're able to say that - meanwhile Canada doesn't support its veterans or First Nations populations adequately...  You're the problem.
t1_dtej24p	0	*	Yeah, they've been capitalist for a long time.
t1_duuwmsl	0	*	But it is by no means socially acceptable and it happens at a vastly lower rate.  Please note I didn't say it was the only cause, just the leading cause.
t1_dutfe1b	0	*	Wouldn't it be fairly practical to make punishing paying for votes to be criminal?  For example, if there is a written record or recording of it, either party goes to jail.
t1_dszmpiz	0	*	He said sorry for being in the KKK = a-ok Trump says he isn't a racist = definitely a racist
t1_dt06btf	0	*	Why would one pay for a fake dossier. Why not just make one up yourself? This is where right wing projection falls apart
t1_dt73uro	1	*	Lol
t1_dt0kznr	1	*	Bequest was actually a typo for request, but behest would be a good word choice as well.
t1_dt0e1cd	1	*	Check out his username. That alone should answer the question.
t1_dt28zv6	0	*	Abortion is murder, plain and simple.    Reproductive health is choice.  If you can't afford it, you probably made terrible life decisions and are poor.  That's your fault.
t1_dt057ol	0	*	The best double agent ever, believe me! Very special! Very double!
t1_dt0cnlr	1	*	He's the latter. Of course.
t1_dszxmub	0	*	We arent talking about Clinton. Were talking about trump. Im not defending Hillary in any way Im pointing out your supreme leader trumps wrong doings.
t1_dtj1ig0	1	*	You got the answer, smart business. Sounds like Scientology didn't really have the choice in this regard, though.
t1_dtj2xiz	0	*	I'd be happy for my taxes to go to those in need 
t1_dtiq4ws	0	*	Speak for yourself, I'm here to support the devices. What is and isn't moral is subjective. There exists no one who isn't aware there is homeless people.
t1_dtix9qu	1	*	It's that male privilege. 
t1_dtk2423	1	*	A modest proposal
t1_dtjlgro	0	*	Interacting with you is like conversing with a retarded child.
t1_dtjd8a7	0	*	I'd rather be homeless than live as a wage slave.
t1_dtja0ql	0	*	Because the homeless are all junkies amirite
t1_dtj3k8l	1	*	And now you're at my original position, can't agree with people pissing on peoples property right? Install the window spikes!
t1_dtj4ui6	1	*	This is probably a lot easier in a wealthy neighborhood than in a poor one. And, from what I've seen, probably is what happens. 
t1_dtjay14	0	*	I think the shitheads criticizing shelters from behind their screen while doing nothing meaningful to work towards a solution are even worse
t1_dtj1azg	1	*	I see you've never been to San Francisco.
t1_dtjdkip	0	*	Yeah, that must be it. Let me ask, have you ever lived anywhere with an actual homeless problem?
t1_dtjg93b	1	*	What?  The same thing would apply to your lawn or beside your house.
t1_dtiuiam	1	*	Venezuela has a housing program which is planning to provide 2 million families with homes.
t1_dtj2wqr	1	*	What a homeless person thinks they need and what society thinks a homeless person needs are often not the same thing. 
t1_dtiwhqa	1	*	I'm not characterising it as a main problem.   Just pointing out that's one reason why shelters won't take people in.  Nothing I said was untrue was it?
t1_dtj7bft	0	*	what do those rooms have to do with female protagonists?
t1_dtj0a6l	0	*	Which makes complete sense, since 3/4 of homeless people are men. Of course there should be more shelters for the group that has more members. 
t1_dtjiahh	1	*	People do. But I believe men should have more places to go with their kids if they need to.
t1_dtivtes	1	*	Wait, so is there a problem with homeless shitting everywhere, or is there not a problem? You keep flip-flopping. 
t1_dtk2bwu	0	*	Nah, if someone can't care for themselves they absolutely should be institutionalized against their will. Plenty of people were, but were kicked out into the street.
t1_dtizhtv	1	*	Why not both? And then eat lobster. No real reason related to the cake thingy, just always wanted to try lobster. 
t1_dtk72zq	0	*	Oh man, if you want me to solve all the compounding issues resulting in homelessness, we are going to be here a while. But while we're at it, how about first we do no harm? 
t1_dtj1zcg	1	*	People pay capital gains taxes on stocks and bonds. Not property taxes.
t1_dtj0yag	1	*	Yeah, funny...
t1_dtirnyn	0	*	Your understanding of the issue is lacking. 
t1_dtivjw1	1	*	I get the joke but there is still the forcefully religious part
t1_dtjk2ba	0	*	You mean into a town cube?
t1_dtjb83f	1	*	I tried to post this video in a Reddit thread before and nobody caught on, I'm glad you found one that will spread awareness for this classic sketch. 
t1_dtj9o59	1	*	>Almost like homeless people are humans and don't necessarily just piss where they lie...   Though, a lot of homeless people have mental issues and don't really care or seem to notice.  
t1_dtj30dk	1	*	We must defend ourselves from the dirty homeless rabble!
t1_du8fslu	1	*	It's typically the Muslims from northwest that did the conquering of India, not the other way around.
t1_du7zlif	0	*	I'd rather not
t1_du8kdz6	1	*	not really. that means, religious minorities unwilling to accept contraception simply become dominant regional majorities in next century, demanding exceptions and holding progress hostage...
t1_du7vam7	1	*	Indian here. Both Taj Mahal and Buddha site is fine to visit. Many Indians stereotype Bihar and UP just like the president of US does with Mexico. 
t1_du887am	1	*	Khalistan in the 1980's comes to mind.
t1_du7lwer	1	*	Gotcha. 
t1_ds4gsph	0	*	They would be classified as WMDs because they're not aimed or targeted and rely on massive area effects which are uncontrolled.
t1_dtke3ah	1	*	You can't just say your argument is right. You have to tell me *why* you think it is.
t1_dth5ng4	1	*	The pickings for English news regarding Iran's internal affairs are slim.  
t1_dst7k5e	0	*	Why not? I have no idea about the numbers, but doesn't a successful transaction depend on it being included in a block? And that block has to be found, which takes a lot of energy.
t1_dsszmpg	1	*	Bitcoin cash is currently 8 times as efficient as Corecoin. And that will only get better with further blocksize increases.
t1_dss1xn8	0	*	My point is that VISA energy usage is probably higher than Bitcoin usage as a whole due to the volume of transactions.
t1_dssi8b9	1	*	Victoria 
t1_dss8jk1	0	*	But you're talking about it going back up after it dips as if it's a certainty. 
t1_dst2php	0	*	Huh? I'm just telling you the source of the meme. Look it up and you'll see it's not an acronym.
t1_dtabv33	0	*	Are you seriously trying to pretend like Iranians weren't the victims of illegal chemical weapons used on them when Iraq tried to invade? It's a documented fact. How sick that you'd try and deny that.
t1_dtop208	1	*	I was correct, since a Democratic Republic is a democracy. If you're going to be a semantic nazi, be correct.
t1_dtp1ie4	1	*	They could prevent any more damage to the country at least. 
t1_dtolmgb	1	*	Halfway crooks
t1_dtojvvj	0	*	I think you mean below.
t1_dto241a	1	*	You really like making things more difficult than they have to be, no?   Or do you not realize that a simple 'yes' would have been sufficient 3 comments up?
t1_dtp4zir	1	*	That's not how begging the question is used, although it definitely should be.
t1_dtnstkm	1	*	Pretty much exactly, honestly.
t1_dtp5bxg	1	*	So that's where the super-Nazis at the CBTS sub-reddit got their phrase from. 
t1_dt1b1fp	1	*	Exactly.  People doing it for the good of the country instead of the extreme agenda some are forced to, and some embrace.
t1_duqz2la	0	*	 A woman was the Empress of the entire Sikh race.  You are a fucking idiot.
t1_dus0hsa	1	*	Don't see NO Horns on you Ivan. 
t1_dtfb65w	1	*	Oh shit, the scores are here now. When I messaged originally though they were hidden. *kisses you apologetically* lol
t1_dsu59sf	1	*	Okay, if you don't want to discuss my points that's okay.   It is kind of no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_(band) , though.   Have a good one, I hope you have a good day!
t1_dt79iae	1	*	Ok buddy
t1_du6qhga	0	*	Oh, please.  I've met Palestinian people and most of them harbor atleast some hatred towards Israel, most of them are pro-Hamas, pro-Hezbollah.  
t1_du6ixpo	1	*	It's a metaphorical examination of post-traumatic stress disorder, well before it was even widely discussed. So I'd say it has some artistic merit.
t1_du6o9to	0	*	Sure buddy. how?
t1_du6n369	0	*	Israel Blockades Gaza, though.  Blockades are military actions that effectively control the borders of a country.  I mean your argument is going nowhere. Even Israel admits it's blockading Gaza.
t1_du6moq2	1	*	Ah, that's my bad. Should've read a bit more carefully. Just sick of people portraying Palestinians as a *thing* to be dealt with.
t1_du71x8e	1	*	Who would stick around to find out? It is not unprecedented for attacks to be taken out in checkpoints.  But it's a fictional movie bro don't get carried away
t1_du7jkox	1	*	Its supremely overlooked but American Muslims are beginning government hate them.
t1_du6n2hp	1	*	After I read it I rented a tent.
t1_du6lzrq	1	*	Eh you are both right. It is indeed whataboutism as your definition suggests yet the point of the boycott does relate to the actions of some Palestinians. 
t1_du6pup6	0	*	To be fair, and like others have said, a lot of peoples criticism is just an excuse to be anti Semitic and rag on the Jews. 
t1_du9500k	1	*	Actually I'm mostly liberal in my political ideology. Libertarianism isn't really much of a thing here other than the one seat David Seymour has!
t1_du6oc8p	0	*	But I made over $300 today just from working at home. Check out this article!
t1_du6zja2	0	*	Imagine going through your entire life believing this. 
t1_du6qeky	0	*	An ambassador not going to see a movie does not amount to a boycott.   Do you not understand this very simple fact?
t1_du6k22w	1	*	Go back to watching hippos fart. Come back when you're out of middle school.
t1_du6y3sy	1	*	I am unworthy to reply. Hope you write a book someday.
t1_du6jkzq	0	*	What do _you_ find deep?
t1_du6kcrq	1	*	Profound.
t1_du6w1mk	1	*	This is fantastic! 
t1_du6tykd	1	*	That's fair! I just saw the correction as an attempt at deflecting an argument rather than a good-faith attempt at help. Glad something good came out of it anyway.
t1_du73e41	1	*	yes, my comment wasn't pretending to know the english curriculum for every high school in america 
t1_dt1aknf	1	*	Okay I understand your point of view now 
t1_dstgcn4	1	*	Seems fairly similar to me....  Bother  > (of a circumstance or event) worry, disturb, or upset (someone).  Cringe  > experience an inward shiver of embarrassment or disgust.
t1_ds1fqhz	0	*	Not as easy to block them in real life once they stop talking about it on the internet and start taking to the streets with tiki torches.  Better to nip it in the bud.
t1_ds1rf7r	1	*	>So long as their policing stops there...  [Germany glances suspiciously at Poland]
t1_dueqf49	1	*	Shhh. We have an internet expert among us.
t1_due6rxe	0	*	They are the owners.  Thats capitalism. Since when do we punish owners of a business they created.  If I want to be a millionaire I need to crate something worth millions.  
t1_due1723	0	*	Neither are you.
t1_duoqp5u	1	*	If you're already heading this way the additional effort is small. If it goes both ways, there's no issue. If it's always one-sided, it starts being problematic.
t1_duogzuz	1	*	No u
t1_ds1ha0w	1	*	That doesn't mean they aren't going to invest. The USSR wasn't exactly in good economic straights and still found money to send over seas for projections.
t1_ds1hqo5	0	*	llolol telling muslims what they are and are not lolol ol' bleddit education at work
t1_ds1hplc	1	*	I remember Obama trying to extend those treaties to stay in Iraq. It was Iraq that wanted us out
t1_ds74j2s	1	*	i took that as an attempt to normalize their position as a nuclear  power and not as a response to their leader being taunted on twitter.  
t1_ds1kmbe	0	*	'South Vietnamese' wouldn't have existed without US intervention; the majority of the Vietnamese population were in favour of the socialist revolution that booted the French out of their country.
t1_ds1ol5o	0	*	The republican party needs uneducated voters, why would they ever reinvest in education?
t1_ds1xzw7	0	*	I'm not trying to build any argument. You're just pissed with my use of the weird trust.
t1_ds1xd80	1	*	Only if you did it deliberately.
t1_ds1fnei	0	*	Most of the funds spent in Pakistan end up channeled back to U.S. contractors.  Pretty much the same case for those other nations you mentioned as well. They aren't given carte blanche on spending it.
t1_ds1n69z	1	*	Yet we can't control Pakistan at all. Afghanistan is a better option.
t1_ds1ok70	0	*	It appears most redditor's knowledge of politics, history and international relations is based on videogames, which is pretty pathetic.

t1_ds1hx3q	0	*	Never heard of Coventry?
t1_ds2sxfp	1	*	I remember shit from Syria saying Trump attacks military targets... So...
t1_ds1e69f	0	*	I think that was the point:  we need that poppy supply on the market so that we can keep the war on drugs going here at home.
t1_ds1nm85	1	*	Boats, with guns (gunboats).  Where's Commodore Perry when you need him?
t1_ds1fe3i	0	*	I know this is suppose to be a cute little digg at the US in Afghanistan, but you do realize Donald Trump would have no problem sending a big fuck you towards the CIA and FBI?  
t1_ds1sfds	0	*	I would never support this nonsense... In public. (Quietly begin playing SOTS because spacewhales are neat).
t1_ds2zo69	1	*	They are less clickbaity but still fairly bad, most of the reputation they used to have is going down the drain as of last few years.
t1_ds1g3sz	0	*	Do you seriously think Obama didn't have a grasp of the situation? 
t1_ds2on7t	0	*	More civilians died in the Attack in Syria, one year into Trump's administration that all the years combined under Obama.
t1_ds1r7ix	1	*	The military budget has not been increased.   The president does not have that authority.   He asked for it to be increased and that is unlikely to happen.

t1_ds30dmg	1	*	Black mirror, Sherlock, downton abbey. They're doing well imposing their limey ideals on the rest of the west
t1_ds1gr5p	1	*	*15 years that America's been there. Muslim countries have been fighting amongst eachother for control of the reason for thousands of years. There is no end in sight, we should not have picked sides.
t1_ds20tsz	0	*	So....Israel has not followed us in to a single war?
t1_ds1fsl4	1	*	Who's we?
t1_ds33qbr	1	*	That will happen when mainstream media pouts every day that Trump is in office and openly throws a tantrum covering him winning.
t1_ds2g5mo	1	*	> The treaty was for 100 years only, that has passed.  False.
t1_ds1ihqd	1	*	More likely it would be spun negatively against him. 
t1_ds1h5zv	1	*	A technocrat would do this. I hope we get a year term from one sometime during my life.
t1_ds1jyen	1	*	https://youtu.be/PX9g_SMFSdU
t1_ds24kd7	1	*	I mean, to be fair, no one really can. Russians tried too. Didn't work out. One of those Russia in winter scenarios. Even back in ancient times, those mountains destroyed armies. What can ya do?
t1_ds1o9ph	0	*	>india prefers russia  well our governments may have a little in common
t1_ds1nmjm	1	*	Well, I've got a very important job for him. I'm gonna need him to stand by the flag in case the General comes by for inspection.
t1_ds1ex77	1	*	No, airheat said cats not goats.
t1_ds1ppkr	1	*	Well hopefully it's a good stoner film.
t1_ds1ftt9	0	*	Some of the local tax money we pay goes to police that terrorize the black community.  Based on your logic, we should stop funding all police across the country.
t1_ds1peei	1	*	 Okay buddy
t1_ds1hwr5	0	*	Sounds like paying Pakistan for their roads is expensive.
t1_ds1hy0s	1	*	We have always been at war with Eastasia. 
t1_ds1f6ey	1	*	It's also a graveyard for expansionist empires, see British and Russian examples.

t1_ds1h6ep	1	*	That's what I'm saying.  He'd also say things like: With all this terrorism, we need the travel ban.  
t1_ds1gr3v	1	*	SEAL team 6 has over a thousand personnel. Just because some people from the unit died in a helicopter crash doesn't mean it's the same people from the actual raid. 
t1_ds23eu1	1	*	Thank you!

t1_ds1e10k	1	*	Dont want to have any more inside jobs!
t1_ds1jamq	1	*	He got tired of winning so much. So much winning.
t1_ds1mvbq	1	*	The US being there prevent's attacks. We pulled out of Iraq and ISIS happened, were still in Afghanistan and there is basically audible crickets as far as terrorists are concerned.
t1_ds1z9j5	0	*	This is really upsetting you isnt it?
t1_ds1gku8	1	*	That 32 billion was since Pakistan was created, initially it was to fight communism. If they were smart about it they could have done what China did, invest instead of giving money just like that.
t1_dsd75fu	0	*	How is the wall bullshit when 4 companies are competing for the final bids?
t1_ds1liv5	1	*	> should we invade Iraq style?  Well, now that you mentioned it, not the worst idea. All we need is a deadly terror attack in US having links from Pak.
t1_ds1nhgc	1	*	Wait, didn't you hear? Obama was boots on ground and personally cleared the room OBL was in.
t1_ds2t3lq	1	*	Fine, can we agree that people comparing Trump to Hitler should not be taken seriously about anything?
t1_ds1jcf4	0	*	Pakistan is like a mentally challenged child that would cut off it's arm if it meant India would get a bruise.
t1_ds1ijnb	0	*	By this logic, you will *never* leave. If you don't plan on conquering the country, you have to let the vacuum sort itself our eventually.
t1_ds1hbx7	0	*	Bullshit.  Youd spin in so that you love Pakistan and hate anything the man did, without regard to your immediate impact. ie tax reform or stock market
t1_ds1pbgb	1	*	That Canada dollars with all their colors
t1_ds1rehh	1	*	Your simplistic Obamaian world view needs help. The only time Saudi was funding and fostering terrorism was when America was enabling them to do it.

t1_ds1h01r	0	*	Because he has enough class to stay out of it and let the next president handle the situation now perhaps?  I'd imagine he is in it for the speaking $ now, not to become a devisive figure

t1_du1kgho	1	*	Well, yes. It's currently Russian if Russia controls it, as much as anyone would like it to be otherwise.
t1_du21uco	0	*	Syrian govt kills its own people with nerve gas. They deserve to be tried for war crimes and killed. Nothing like that goes on in NATO countries.

t1_du34n2d	1	*	Whataboutism
t1_du2z9m8	0	*	She isnt from soviet Russia. Shes from Yugoslavia and if you know anything about their history at all, you know that they had bad relations with the ussr. So again, those three people. 
t1_du391nx	1	*	Didnt a co pilot crash a passenger plane into a mountain a few years ago in Europe because he was suicidal? 
t1_du38gkj	1	*	The reason is simpleRussia (Moskovia) is an empire, has been for centuries. The Moscow metropoly looks down on its colonies, on people from the exploited othernational provinces.
t1_du32o4c	1	*	Thank you! 
t1_du362oa	1	*	That's great and all, but unless there were some former KGB on the plane it's not really pertinent to the tragedy at hand.
t1_du2xeqj	1	*	Easy fella, we ain't holding the stick. 
t1_du3fsq7	1	*	WHY ARE THERE SO MANY GOOD POINTS TO THIS
t1_du2wrd5	1	*	Ya many of them are just cases of ignorance but gotta pump up those numbers to make American schools look like some kind of war zone. Just comes off as disingenuous. 
t1_du31py0	1	*	Surely there were other tribes that lost out to the Celts. No love for them?
t1_du341yg	0	*	Like that cargo plane in Afghanistan
t1_du2ycah	0	*	He sounds kind of like Borat from your description.
t1_du31kwl	1	*	As much as they might like that to be the case, its far more complex than that. ISIS proved the guy was not in control of much.
t1_du2yjzy	0	*	Sentences that start with 'dude' don't end well.
t1_du4h2cu	1	*	It looks like the plane was accelerating as it was falling.
t1_du36u74	0	*	I think his point is that the way the stat was presented didnt leave room for this line of jokes. 
t1_du34wy2	1	*	I love lamp?
t1_du3d19a	1	*	How? When I try to watch stuff on iPlayer it makes me sign in. You sure you're not still signed in from ages ago and just forgot?
t1_du32ny0	0	*	why are you upset about this
t1_du3wsvd	0	*	The joke is that the drone only got a ding and a few scratches, but the helicopter got fucked up!  Boom you can tell by my thousands of upvotes that it was hilarious.
t1_du2wnuj	1	*	I hope this does not get overlooked
t1_du2wchq	1	*	 Seems lots of people on here are willing to create confusion as to their credentials.  Seems as though they want to bunch of anonymous people to think they are a pilot. 
t1_dtjz7xg	0	*	Jeez, even tripadvisor agrees with you: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attractions-g39604-Activities-Louisville_Kentucky.html  Parks, historic sites, museums and caverns as the top things to do. :(
t1_dttz6f7	0	*	I feel most accomplished when I have a lot of downvotes without any replies. 
t1_dt5bzd3	0	*	They are not looking for an endless stream of immigrants. Please stop listening to Fox News' poisonous lies. 
t1_dt4nn74	1	*	Not necessarily, I personally know some people who went to other countries to work as maids, carpenters and other menial jobs (legally though).
t1_dt698va	1	*	$7,000 earns you here in louisiana a 2 year technical degree that proivide you with a 30/hour job. You trying to go college for some 4 year degree that will provide nothing on purpose?
t1_dt5qgzo	1	*	Because he obviously hasnt an issue importing uneducated Eastern Europeans from Yugoslavian shitholes and its perfectly clear what the difference between these two people are. 
t1_dt4wjd6	1	*	If thats what you define as acting like a brat, you must have a hard time on this sub.
t1_dt5e04d	0	*	The thing is that nobody seems normal nowdays. It's either sensitive commies or Jew hating Nazis. In a way I am loving this shitshow

t1_dsvq4gz	0	*	I'm at work at the moment but I'd be glad to in about 6 hours when I am home if I could remember, that being said you made a claim first so please provide evidence as well. 
t1_ds4l2n7	0	*	As someone who was paid a living wage while developing tech skills, and is now the lead encryption engineer for a federal agency, I call bullshit till the cows come home. 
t1_ds4tqdq	0	*	You're making the assumption that those stats apply uniformally to all professions which is just idiotic. Doctors aren't underemployed, they're not working as mcdonalds cooks.
t1_ds5jw6d	1	*	Read the link, BBN is a US company
t1_ds4vs6x	1	*	I meant how much are your peers in this other division offering these new degreed hires?  Subway sandwich artists aren't making anywhere near $65k let alone $88k.
t1_ds4ma8q	1	*	True, this reflects my experience as well.
t1_dt5o320	0	*	Did you just have a stroke? What's your address so I can send an ambulance
t1_dupemdz	1	*	??
t1_du1u5d7	1	*	That is really downplaying the situation if Trump really was part of a Russian money laundering operation considering he is now President.
t1_dsdxoyv	0	*	University professors of history both research and publish. 
t1_dtruluq	1	*	Thanks for the crash course! :)
t1_dtsdpee	0	*	thats not a true statement.   look up what it can help with.
t1_dtuam06	1	*	You miss the point that a lot of people dont buy cigarettes at the store.. they buy illegal imported on the street..  because they are cheaper 
t1_dttjs87	1	*	How is that relevant when you pretty much can't practically buy an illegal, material thing without also possessing it?  
t1_ds9w3vf	1	*	I gots ya fam. https://www.lifewire.com/view-or-type-emoji-3485881

t1_dul75bt	1	*	It's not that bad as you might think.
t1_dukpib8	1	*	Well, this just shows your idea of actual russian trolls has no ground, like, at all. As for the language - I guess this is Chinese, am I correct ?  
t1_dt49wpj	0	*	Yep. And the Cheeto wasnt elected by the people.
t1_dsrein5	0	*	The reports about who fired the rockets and what happened to the people who did have come from the israeli security forces. They are fully aware of the situation. 
t1_dsr6i52	0	*	the only money actually going to terrorists in this are the canteen payments, and as the article explains Israel actually facilitates this cash flow into Israeli prisons.
t1_dsn4ujd	1	*	The T_Denizens can always move their discussion to Cap or Gap or whatever the fuck that neo-nazi media site is called, then. Or 4ch's /bravo/ or /papa-oscar-lima/ board.
t1_dta3s3x	0	*	First you say: >She's just old and hates young people.  Then you say: >SJWs aren't really a thing.  Clearly, you haven't a clue what you're talking about...   p.s. SJW's are definitely a thing.
t1_dta4j84	1	*	Among the highest tax burden in the world. You get what you pay for, I guess. 
t1_dtan8ww	0	*	And then some wonder why people rather run and fight to the death rather than be taken in by US cops.
t1_dt9xl4t	0	*	Not just more, Kxf6ln is not a bit FCK.
t1_dtamxdw	0	*	nice comeback... enjoy your freedom ill enjoy my 8 weeks of vacation and cheap delicious beer
t1_dta5bn9	1	*	You realize that fighting words are not protected speech and that decision was reached when someone was arrested for calling someone else a facsist, which was held up 9-0 in the Supreme Court 
t1_dt9yv4s	1	*	KappaRoss
t1_dt9zqyb	1	*	Explain why a person intelligent enough to be a University professor would travel to Germany and call a cop there a, Nazi.     Has to be an automatic response. 
t1_dt9wt5u	1	*	Its literally all memorizing facts, thats all it is. 
t1_dtajitv	1	*	Legitimately one of the most popular haircuts right now in the west lol. You might as well arrest everybody at my school if that makes you a nazi. 
t1_dtakayb	0	*	And without France you'd still be saying God save the queen. What's your point?
t1_dtbaqqd	0	*	Why do the police care? About being frivolously compared to nazis? In **Germany**?
t1_dta7e9c	0	*	You should buy a decent bike  Ouch!  That was uncalled for!  
t1_dtacps0	0	*	Fucking bastard grammar Nazi police
t1_dta9yhd	0	*	but does this get enacted very often? there are so many pictures and reports of people with signs about kiling and/or burning obama, which would get you locked up pretty fast in germany
t1_dtabtto	1	*	:)
t1_dta9ql9	1	*	If you're just gonna run away because you don't have a real argument, why even bother replying? To get the last word in? 
t1_dtaj9fd	1	*	I'm probably taking this the wrong way, but that sounds like an intelligent, rational way to say diversity is bad. 
t1_dt9wjyg	1	*	I think you will find it is about memorising facts. thats learning.
t1_dta3gmr	0	*	Say that 2 me in real life mate I swear down ill fuckin clobber u

t1_dtalmsp	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvnfntPqH4E  I can go on like this all day.  Bad things happen to you when you piss off the cops.  Freedom of Speech be damned.
t1_dta0sp9	1	*	Is this copypasta?
t1_dtaqfc3	1	*	Yup, dead guys can hardly contest claims of being linked to bad people.
t1_dta5osa	1	*	Your first amendment is only cool in theory, in practice things work different and it's up to the cop how he'll intepret the encounter and whether you're interfering with his duty.
t1_dta5osj	1	*	Oh come on, that's an absurd over-generalization.  The people who were left behind in Europe were *stupid* enough to start WWI, where's your answer to that?
t1_dtfmv1l	1	*	Is it any different when Hitler and his group of Brown Shirts (Sturmabteilung) were doing the exact same thing? 
t1_dtaoby1	0	*	Not at all what I meant. They're our family. They're ours to insult.   I meant someone coming into your country and telling you how to do things, flagrantly disregarding your laws. 
t1_dtaydrh	0	*	Caesar went in the reverse direction though.
t1_dtaa7gr	1	*	They're not wrong...
t1_dta668f	1	*	Thanks, that makes more sense
t1_dta9x25	0	*	Not really, unless you can back that claim up. 
t1_dta07gu	0	*	Yeah, I figured it wasn't a native English speaker, but thought I'd have a little fun :) since the joke was tee'd up. Not trying to be insulting, just playin'.
t1_dta9amf	0	*	But it's not just using the word Nazi that's illegal. It's just general insults too.
t1_dta0eaf	1	*	I just looked up what they are, no one I've met eats shrimp but we do eat prawns. Not really interchangeable though I guess haha
t1_dta70uv	1	*	Calling cops Nazis is political speech, so it ought to have the highest protection.
t1_dt9wcuk	1	*	That makes sense. Hopefully the understand the cultural differences here where she didn't.
t1_dtah2tw	0	*	We get it, you hate America and love Communism.
t1_dta7pji	0	*	No, I just treat women as the individuals they are, rather than objects to get sex from.  &nbsp;  ...works wonders.
t1_dtbn590	0	*	There is one meaning for calling somebody a nazi. If you mean something else by it then say something else. Especialy if you play the educated high horse card she did in her article.
t1_dta88oo	1	*	Yup, my hot glue gun never leaves my side.
t1_dta9n3u	1	*	Ughh disgusting American girls, they're so slutty with their attraction to accents. Why can't they be like everyone else and sleep with people based on appearance 
t1_dtalfh4	0	*	But would you be happy if they left Germany and the surrounding countries?
t1_dtacdxu	1	*	IT IS absolutely nothing like civil forfeiture
t1_dta214c	0	*	> For me at least, Catholic social justice comes especially to mind.   Why? They're an absurdly small minority and not at all a representative sample.
t1_dtakqqe	1	*	:-(
t1_dtae1su	0	*	Are you really this fucking delusional? Find a single reputable source that states that Muslims was treated favourably in Nazi Germany.
t1_dtabwr2	0	*	Not really? Youre saying that have to be ultra careful to not get shot or arrested because police are like crazed dogs, willing to kill or attack at the smallest slight.
t1_dtalj55	0	*	Not in bavaria
t1_dta4ux5	0	*	You probably were top 5-10% at top law school too
t1_dta7ru4	1	*	Canadian for Australian for beer. 
t1_dta4y0j	1	*	Its in South America. I'm not American either.
t1_dtar7nx	1	*	Sorry, I meant it is Miss. I just abbreviated. That was my point, Miss should be fine, it is a good way to go on the whole. This lady is just a bitch and wants reasons to complain.
t1_dt9usgh	0	*	You sound like some kind of Nazi apologist 
t1_dtbxudq	1	*	In this situation, yes. If we had a better option, we'd be using it. Drones are not the most effective strategy, but we don't want to actively invade Pakistan.
t1_dtaxycj	1	*	I've seen enough videos of people bashed in the streets to disagree. 
t1_dta9pjf	0	*	I'm not at all arguing that she's not a jerk.    I'm just saying it might be that they're both jerks. 
t1_dtao20g	1	*	Not a German but working here. ~45% of our salary goes in taxes. So there's that. 
t1_dt9zyfr	1	*	Right click translate in chrome.

t1_dtab695	0	*	Depends I would call it T1.5  It's no Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT, nor an Ivy League school.  Sorry Hoyas, you're just not T1.
t1_dtb0skw	0	*	> If you don't see that terms like 'racist', 'fascist', or 'nazi' are getting thrown around unnecessarily, it's because you're not looking.  Maybe you see them so much because you're looking?
t1_dt9qnbv	1	*	That entire statement is wrong
t1_dta4ntp	1	*	> but it would seem that controlling speech in this way is a recipe for suppressing unpopular speech.  For example?  
t1_dta76np	1	*	Hahahahahaha
t1_dtc6qwl	1	*	Nor I you.
t1_dtbi7iz	1	*	Most of my friends are anti-Trump and we're not communist or socialist. In fact, most of us are pro-capitalism. We don't like Trump because he's a blubbering moron. 
t1_dtafn1y	1	*	>How about the German nurse who was recently in the news for killing 100 people . I can't call him a monster ?  You can. You can also call people Nazis, as long as you have good reason to do so.
t1_dt9zayt	0	*	I understand where you're coming from, but some degrees are just inherently (mostly) memorization. 
t1_dta5oyk	0	*	That is for **foreign** public officials, not for German officials. The laws against disparaging the German head of state and public officials are still in place.
t1_dtaajk9	1	*	Nah, you are correct:  https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/miss
t1_dt9socu	1	*	Theyre horrible. But you do not go to jail for life. Also there is a mountain of difference between calling someone a Nazi and accusing them of rape. 
t1_dtbibtv	1	*	Thank you, now I get it. I agree.
t1_dta0mu1	1	*	Technicaly i wrote her but my phone changed it to your for some reason.
t1_dtab461	0	*	What? I'm being paid by the German government because I post facts that you don't like?     I see the irony of Poland complaining about debt and immigration has gone over your head by a lot.
t1_dt9xg08	1	*	The feel of it is hard to describe to laypeople.  It is almost like an ample bosom and a flaccid phallus at the same time.  Truly euphoric!!!

t1_dta99n1	0	*	Let's take a count of how many dictators America has allowed to lead the country and how many each nation of Europe as had?
t1_dtac5uf	0	*	It might have something to do with all the third degree burns and shit that she got.
t1_dta31ns	1	*	Yeah if he took two seconds to look it reads like a medium length autobiography. Its even linked in the original comment
t1_dtac542	1	*	They already said they realized that before you even posted. What do you not comprehend about this? Your comment was pointless and smug.

t1_dtakt9s	0	*	If that's not allowed in the US either then I'm wondering why so many people, from the US, seem to think that Germany has so much worse laws?
t1_dta21rv	1	*	Damn. You met germans smoking pot in america? Certainly they only came there to smoke pot, and for nothing else.

t1_dta5ugi	1	*	  >they alsmo make about 100k a year  Yeah, that's absolutely not true.  A police officer in Germany with about 9 years experience earns on average just under 50K Euro per year. No where near 100k. 
t1_dta0m0a	1	*	We adopted him :*)
t1_dszgva6	1	*	You're absolutely right
t1_dt1j770	0	*	It's also not really a drinking food.  Nobody says lets go get smashed and eat some sushi here.  It's lets get smashed while eating some type of kushiyaki, yakiniku, place with various small dishes.

t1_duqa7ho	1	*	So clueless.
t1_dur3of7	1	*	Sounds similar to the conservatives in the UK
t1_duqbc7b	0	*	Yeah, those Vietcong really lost big time. Remember when we had overwhelming success against those Afghani goat farmers? Having weapons didn't help them protect themselves at all. 
t1_duqb8jc	0	*	Hey if you wanted to outlaw all lobbyist groups, rather than just the ones you don't agree with, then you might have an argument.  Up for outlawing Planned Parenthood's activism too?

t1_dsff1bo	1	*	Thats a terrible analogy. Theres actual evidence of the Holocaust. Most of the shit that flies in the face of Trump is made up. 
t1_dsfdjou	0	*	Its hard to say where your same comments started and ended. There were just so many of them and they were all so similar. 
t1_dsfhhtq	0	*	It was before oil prices collapsed.

t1_dsfl5c4	0	*	Oh god  487 to 2626  Again, not even really close.   Not enough to warrant a 93 % chance of losing. He still won 5x more than her.   The point remains.

t1_dujwocq	1	*	It is.
t1_dujqab2	1	*	So, similar to JROTC we have here in the states, it's an introduction to marching, drill, discipline and the rank structure but no actual tactical training. It's more like a history/PT class. 
t1_dtrtlv0	1	*	You could also make cider or wine with some non-pasteurized juice a 5 gal bucket and an airlock. Much cheaper than the equipment required for making beer.
t1_ds8tj37	0	*	No it isnt, I just explained why.
t1_ds90qui	1	*	good for who?
t1_ds87560	0	*	So, the people who voted for Hillary did so because of a hate for white people and hatred of anything republican or do you genuinely view half the country as inherently evil?

t1_dsp3wvq	1	*	Right, you were saying that Russia doesn't get close to the USA, but their navy and airforce do on the reg. So let's stop pretending otherwise. 
t1_dsp8k4s	1	*	Except Mig15 when nobody else got access to them, even their friends didn't. Wish we were in that situation today without the Nato BS, get half & half of equipment from West & East.

t1_dsplmqx	0	*	Everything is flammable. It just takes a high enough temperature. You don't know basic chemistry.

t1_dspcatb	1	*	Im capable of being just as sorry as you are
t1_dspgrb7	1	*	Agreed!
t1_dspbhk8	1	*	Neither THAAD nor SM-3 works on ICBMs - the only anti-ICBM tech the US has is the GMB which is much less consistent.  THAAD itself is designed to shoot down up to IRBMs.

t1_dsp2xql	1	*	His translation is certainly a bit wonky though.
t1_dsq99el	1	*	Thats a good question.  Missile defense is not the answer.  It is an inevitable step in the wrong direction.
t1_dsouv8q	0	*	Or they can Sully it. I mean, boats have propellers, planes have propellers, what's the big deal?
t1_dsp6uom	0	*	_why tho_
t1_dsrny2j	0	*	That saying 400,000 people have died in North Korean concentration camps is perhaps spurious at best, and doesnt tell us much.
t1_dsrso78	1	*	Yeah, tell that to Bernie
t1_dsrmf0k	0	*	SHAME! *ding ding*
t1_dsrnjn0	0	*	Yes it does. Voting in one round takes less time and costs less. It also prevents shady dealings in further rounds and voter fraud
t1_dss1gd8	1	*	When did Sinclair Broadcasting become Democrat?  Sinclair alone holds over 40% of the news market. After they acquire Tribune? Over 70%.
t1_dsrmdl0	1	*	Guns themselves are not a problem.  Case in point? Switzerland. Lowest crime rate in the EU. Mandatory gun ownership.  It's the people who use them that are the problem.
t1_dsrnqve	1	*	Japan, the country that used Koreans as fuck toys? Yeah fuck Japan.

t1_dsrsthj	1	*	Ok then fair enough
t1_dsrqipu	1	*	Thank you.  It's a given that NK is a lunatic regime of crazy people that scare the crap out of me.  It's just most people were used to the US being *much* further from that line than they are now.

t1_dskyy1i	0	*	Why military spending? Why not think about trying to fix the disaster that is Social Security? 
t1_dslloxt	0	*	Nobody is lying about the direct quotes from Trump's mouth except for Trump. Virtually everything that spews from his shithole is embarassing.  Trump's tweets alone are reason to despise him.
