t1_dv39bpd	0	*	Assume what you want, but the fact that you jumped to conclusions to prove your point was pathetic to get someone to agree with you.  See how that works.
t1_dskdjay	0	*	>  North Korea talks to South Korea again? Yes  HAHAHAHA, you Trump supporters love to try and take credit for everything good happening in the world despite having no involvement.  
t1_dv3dwpa	0	*	Then stop supporting them through your actions for crying out loud.
t1_du8w3k1	1	*	1m^2 is 10.7 ft^2 - I usually do 1 to 10.   Google ft squared to m squared  So 1ft^2 in Moscow is only $1860. 
t1_dsodof6	0	*	And yet it's still an act of war, to which Israel had the right to retaliate.
t1_dtfempm	0	*	How many times must they cheat before you label them cheats?
t1_dt8q3jt	0	*	So, keep the dog on a leash while you're at work, instead of just letting it roam the yard freely? Oh, it's barking too, and your neighbor sleeps during the day for their night shift at the hospital? 
t1_dtz0042	0	*	Yeah you definitely didn't say just like Germany.  I did say it's less of a problem than anything, just like feeding children is less of a problem than anything. 
t1_dtwt6q2	1	*	Yeah, it's something, I won't fight against it.
t1_dty0l30	1	*	I think he was saying that Gaza isn't a country?
t1_dtxt8bb	1	*	I'm not talking about a coup. The context was a revolution which last time involved slaughtering most officers. 
t1_dtwtp5o	1	*	Sorry. Did so in another reply.   The border fence/wall has been a multi-decade project. Are you suggesting that Fatah have had full and unwavering control over the west bank since 1992?
t1_dtwm973	0	*	*bang* 
t1_dtwtqbj	1	*	I agree with that 100%.
t1_dtwx5o6	1	*	Half the point of having a Jewish state is that Jews can go there when it becomes dangerous to live elsewhere. 
t1_dsql3pj	1	*	I'll hopefully leave you with some things to cover with self reflection, instead of crying wolf about anti-semitism.  Intelligent people never need to point out their intelligence.
t1_ds3jphq	0	*	One man's demagoguery is another's calling a spade a spade. And it is the ruling party that gets to choose. Authoritarianism at its finest.
t1_dshbzu2	1	*	No, they don't. But I guess we'll just have to agree you're happy to remain ignorant.
t1_dsh1cyo	0	*	That's about what I expected.
t1_dsiugcz	1	*	And lets not kid ourselves here, the tax cuts weren't a gift from god. Let's wait a few years when again, corporations, not small business or middle class are getting those same benefits. 
t1_dsgb393	0	*	I mean I figured I was just playing devils advocate 
t1_dsfv8m6	0	*	Wheres your answer to the famolies of those 200k you killed. Ah you dont have one. Sad.

t1_dseyh9g	0	*	You seem like the kind of person we won't really miss.
t1_dv2r82s	0	*	Im not saying Canada took part in war of 1812.  Im saying Canadians took part.
t1_dujhphz	0	*	oh the ones that represent the people, not the interlopers.
t1_dujjxcq	0	*	no, i think there's a language barrier here, so i'm just bowing out of the conversation.
t1_dswbvoi	1	*	Why is it or responsibility to try and find who is cheating and who isn't? Christ.    I'm liberal, but this is some super pussy shit.
t1_duhbl0r	1	*	Fuck off with your condescending bullshit, you hypocritical lying bigot.  Everything I said about you was true.
t1_dsdr3aw	0	*	I mean, you can say stuff like he expanded the patriot act, but he curtailed a large part of it. You know, the one Snowden exposed? That peccadillo?  Nah, but he worse den Bush, doe. 
t1_dse9unw	0	*	You don't think that publicly traded companies have enormous influence on our public policy, otside of market forces? I don't even know where to start.
t1_dsdv0wi	1	*	Didn't realize it was capped at that amount. Thanks! 
t1_dtdf618	1	*	That was funny Ill give you that one 
t1_dtdqfz1	0	*	I'm on mobile and I'm not taking the time to type out a long response.  I yield. You win. 
t1_dsa2ut6	1	*	Lol, that's a good one.
t1_ds385rg	0	*	I think you're interpolating a bit
t1_dug3pn2	0	*	Right cuz people like judges and investigators are completely the same as random people on the internet who try to do digging like the boston bomber and Ellen Pao.
t1_dufb706	0	*	Whats ur point. 
t1_dugj0gd	0	*	Google institutional investment. I made 60% last year. Im more than well versed in finance. Investopedia can help you.
t1_dstvv3s	0	*	I meant more in the sense of the continuation of the cold war, wherein China would be considered a Soviet actor, not so much soviet in the narrow sense of just Russia and the U.S.S.R.
t1_dstsktf	0	*	Seriously? As they test and flaunt their missile program and Trump exchanges derogatory tweets at their ruler, and soldiers defect, you think this is a relevant as 300 years ago...  
t1_dsu5r7o	0	*	Also that cease fire is still in effect today. The Korean War hasn't officially ended
t1_dstwais	0	*	ha ha ha ha   Riiiight.   Keep your head in the sand. 
t1_dstq17m	1	*	I hate drama translates to I don't like drama directed at me
t1_dstqab9	0	*	The link you posted contradicts your point and reinforces the other guys point. He's being a cock but he's not wrong. They are asking the IOC if they can do it. It's not the plan yet.
t1_dsu9bhg	1	*	Guy uses vector graphics tools to make vector graphics
t1_dsdaz96	0	*	how mad do you think some of the cardinals would be if they elected some random catholic from like New Jersey to be Pope.   Sounds like an idea for sitcom
t1_dsr9fe8	0	*	Yes it can be applied to used cars. There are mileage (mpg) requirements. 
t1_dsr6hjr	0	*	Damned if there isn't! And for under $100, too! Fuck that garage that told me three grand!
t1_dss1csh	1	*	I mean, yeah sure, but still, nice porn. Just wanted to clear the air on that.
t1_duwzm2i	1	*	> Legalisation does not prevent that from happening. Plenty of people are fired and lose custody of kids for being drunks.  More are put in state sponsored treatment programs.
t1_duy2dk9	1	*	I've done both.  It's not the same at all.
t1_du981zh	0	*	I already said I don't trust them.
t1_dua2895	0	*	> Gamergate is majority left leaning  -An actual human being 
t1_du9jv1c	1	*	Just trying to get my kicks, baby!

t1_dtcwk1d	0	*	Want me to prove it? Watch me copy paste this same reply to my other accounts.  
t1_dtcvwtr	0	*	Speak for myself
t1_dsw0vgn	1	*	That is a very legitimate point you have. Honestly I had not thought about the matter that way before.
t1_dsvoofn	1	*	The chance of being the unlucky 10% is so small, I can't help but say I'm in
t1_dsvckn9	1	*	Tools are certainly technology, and yes, the chimp sticking a stick in a termite mound uses that technology
t1_dtcsz3s	1	*	Some advice for next time - attack the argument not the person ;)
t1_ds92rki	0	*	No one said it had to be perfectly motivated. Im saying we need to recognize that racism can and often does play a part. If you pretend it doesnt you cant do anything about it. This isnt complicated. 
t1_ds7vqfz	0	*	Shit man, taking me to way back when I was a kid. I don't remember the name of the program, but I remember it was a grey box with a big red emblem/button on it
t1_ds8dzcb	1	*	You are either mentally deficient or trolling. Either way, sterilize yourself with a mallet, preferably via head trauma.
t1_ds7w4ja	1	*	Actually just realized. 144p. Didnt know that was an option. Shoot
t1_ds89vh8	1	*	Lol. Are you even serious?
t1_ds89kiw	1	*	How is capitalism totalitarian?
t1_dsgb4em	1	*	This is why I hate getting into long comment threads. I lose track of the original argument. 
t1_dsg35ht	0	*	And Bernie lost to a person who lost to Donald Trump. 
t1_dsgj89h	0	*	So what you're saying is they all fucked up? They can get around it now?
t1_dsgf1n7	1	*	Yep. I remember people being like, Maybe it's an act and he won't be that bad. And I was like, Yeah, maybe that's the case, but... what if he's not acting?
t1_dsinre3	0	*	yes im aware of your reference but i refuse to believe that you are not trolling by this point (or just really clueless)
t1_dt3z83y	0	*	Here we go:  http://networkbooks.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dunning-kruger-effect.jpg  
t1_duc3az5	0	*	If you mean rape cases per 100.000 citizens, the US has one of the highest rates in the world. Germany doesn't even come close.
t1_dslbwor	0	*	You mistake me for someone who cares. I dont really, I simply do not jump on the mob bandwagon. Today her views are unfashionable. Tomorrow it may be yours.
t1_dssfug0	0	*	That's true, your dumb opinions are indeed beyond my comprehension, like how the electoral college and partisan gerrymandering are related, for instance.
t1_dspcydk	0	*	In what situation do you think we'd be deploying tactical, low-yield warheads in a MIRV configuration?  And in what situation would a nuclear SLCM be a replacement for that capability?
t1_dtqwbxt	0	*	That's rich, coming from a Republican. Your entire *party* is a scam against the poor.
t1_dtzhckx	0	*	Whatever you pretentious child
t1_dsl6s8j	0	*	Again, missing the point entirely.
t1_dsltbzy	0	*	Which field did you choose? I did software engineering U0001f600
t1_dslumy5	0	*	unemployment != higher white collar wages...  >Norway would be the more attractive option my friend!  I disagree there is more to this than meets the eye, particularly white collar wages
t1_dslt217	1	*	You are incredibly annoying and immature. Did anyone ever tell you that?
t1_duyl1zi	0	*	Sure. The dude above wasnt talking about that though. 
t1_duwwn8u	1	*	You'd be surpised how many hispanics voted for the guy.  I was heading into something with this, then i got busy.  Go to class.
t1_duuhhsq	1	*	Lol. Congratulations! 
t1_dsc71o1	0	*	I dont know what to tell you man. [Tax Cuts](https://www.thebalance.com/trump-s-tax-plan-how-it-affects-you-4113968)  
t1_ds5yxza	0	*	Great, Im just suggesting you go to Pakistan if you hate America. 
t1_dsato2n	1	*	So, in the audio of the speech at that link, Bill Clinton is lying when he says he is going to sign NAFTA into law?
t1_dtsvk93	0	*	Yes, you have only proven that a sizable chunk of Aemricans are braindead cult members.      Crawl back to T_D, troll.    Tagged and ignored.  Bye. 
t1_duybna4	0	*	But that's the point it won't be 10% for everything. Things made in the UK just gets cheaper by comparison and so more appealing. Free trade isn't always the best economically.
t1_duzccxw	1	*	Heh, good point.
t1_duywgjy	1	*	Any dude that gets personal happiness out of launching new country killer ICBMs or personally over sees the bombing of civilians,   is a fucked up dude. 
t1_duzs0w2	0	*	They're seeking regulatory action to force Rosneft to sell their stake in Citgo. Hopefully the Trump Administration will do the right thing and force a takeover from American investors. 
t1_ds5m9ju	1	*	It wasn't a question of could, it was a question of their only choices being: A) cut production B) implode  You do know the difference between reactive and proactive, right?  
t1_ds9q5sh	0	*	Would definitely be funny to wipe my phone before a visit and fill it with dick pics though.
t1_ds9xvbj	0	*	You do realize the Consitution doesn't say anything about murder, right?  Constitutional rights and laws are not necessarily the same thing.
t1_dsbk7dg	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_search_exception  I mean its a simple google search.
t1_du3w1o5	0	*	That's odd, because a five second google of your comment history indicates otherwise, and you sure seem obsessed with crypto currency.  I hope your day is as pleasant as you are, take care.
t1_dun9pvf	1	*	I can't believe this name wasn't taken. It's gold Jerry!
t1_dun48o6	0	*	Because your narrative was that the Russians are working for both sides which is proven false by Muellers states within the indictment.
t1_duaknui	0	*	You know you can just... google it, right?
t1_du5lgky	1	*	I just gave them away to someone who needed one. Better than having someone else pay to use them.
t1_dti6qqj	1	*	Btw can I just say that this is how 2 people who have disagreements debate? Thank you for being respectful and sticking to the argument in hand
t1_dtssfli	0	*	Nope  I won't be politically correct to protect your feelings. Modern conservatives are evil. 
t1_dtnazt5	0	*	The fisa court didn't state that the warrant request would not have been approved without the dossier, nunes is merely asserting that claim without supporting evidence.
t1_dtn51jv	0	*	More like he said, she said where the she said side can't defend themselves because it is classified information.
t1_dt8rtcp	1	*	We are a weird people...
t1_dt9n7f9	1	*	Ahh
t1_dt6veht	1	*	My intent was to mock. I have done so. 
t1_dsbgn3a	1	*	Serbia? Greece?
t1_dsam0ox	1	*	Bruh, it's horrible. One side calls you a filthy commie, the other calls you a nazi.
t1_dsb0x2z	0	*	READ THE FUCKING REFERENCES. Or just dont bother, you'll be too stupid to understand them anyway. 
t1_dsar6ef	0	*	No, the topic is the pollution of the world's water supply, and that is done by the agriculture industry, % of land used doesn't matter.
t1_dv6z6wi	0	*	Again, thats not what the indictment says.
t1_duxeqcq	0	*	Did you read the rest of my post where I explained the context of my original post? Or did it all go over your head?  
t1_dsh1p57	1	*	>wow how can you be so confident yet so ignorant lol  im acting like every modern communist so as to help you understand
t1_dsfnbgh	0	*	Wow, the names are unnecessary. I think you need to calm down. Getting upset at a random guy on an internet forum isn't how I'd want to spend my day.
t1_dsfr1k0	1	*	Lol k
t1_dt2yv4e	0	*	I guess you don't know what being fragile and easily stirred is in that case.
t1_dt2wb9o	0	*	Trump wasn't whacking his hand against his chest though.

t1_dt357ks	1	*	I've got your back lol
t1_dsa9r8g	0	*	Emergency landing on water vs mountains. 
t1_dsxlomo	0	*	Yes, it was two different contracts. The Washington Free Beacon ended, I believe its stated, in late 2015. Shortly thereafter they were contracted by Perkins Coie.
t1_dsevdaj	1	*	No please continue.
t1_dspbpay	1	*	I wasnt dealing with that because it's off topic, I'm dealing with current events addressed in the article.   But yes I'd like to see reparations and beyond that everything returned that was taken
t1_dsp7chl	0	*	> You must live in some amazing fictional world, because neither of those are free where I live. I had to pay $300 to get a buss pass for a single semester.  from first grade to 12th?
t1_dujy4wl	0	*	Even this article calls it a crock of shit. Good job.
t1_dv7yabp	0	*	You want me to cite the citation you tried citing to prove me wrong but actually proved my point? 
t1_dukudzt	1	*	So you don't trust him in his professional judgement but believe him 100% in a casual conversation? That's weird. 
t1_dtgowkk	1	*	> on behalf of his client Natalia  See - This is where it's clear (again) that you lack the reading comprehension skills to understand the who/what/why of this meeting, and how it all went down. 
t1_du1uz7r	0	*	Can you elaborate? What do you believe their feelings would be?
t1_du25poe	0	*	No, hes not. Harassing black folk on the street on the way to the liquor store while saying a couple Hail Marys in preparation of the next feetsball game isnt culture.
t1_du30xk9	0	*	Shitstains  lol It is hilarious to me when you people literally become that which you hate so much.  Keep being ignorant.
t1_du3evpq	1	*	The comment I replied to said that the Olympics are a great place to push politics because the whole world is watching. I said the world doesn't give a shit (because it is a domestic issue). 
t1_du24o5c	1	*	They've had their way in the past. When were we ever as bad as Saudi Arabia?
t1_du4lkaw	1	*	Lol the only civil right he ever opposed was gay marriage. You guys are all acting like he was trying to put gays in concentration camps and not let them vote
t1_du1n1z4	0	*	How would that work?
t1_dv4v9v6	1	*	Name others?
t1_dv6mfp6	0	*	Comparing luxury cars to your mainstream family makes. Good deal. Just don't mention the ridiculous depreciation German cars have.
t1_duhj0i6	0	*	Haha well the thread section was about China and the US.  Perhaps I was too quick to label you Chinese.  Tell me, where is the 10 day old account /u/Tuusannuuska from? 
t1_dtyumkc	1	*	Uh huh
t1_dsldike	0	*	You're nuts.

t1_dtfjt9j	0	*	I see then. Have a nice day!
t1_dut9sb3	1	*	I think McCain would have walked away with it in 2016 vs either of the major candidates.  I'll give you Bob Dole. 
t1_dut9kkp	1	*	So why not set the rigging at 55-60 %  approval ?   And the establishment is hardly liberal. Wtf is it with all of these Americanisms lately
t1_dut7xuq	0	*	just don't bury it in an ordinary hole in the ground where anyone could find it
t1_dv2i949	1	*	Ok, I dont understand the point you were trying to make in relation to my comment then. Could you please explain it?
t1_dsohas3	1	*	i know babe, im sorry :(
t1_dskld7d	0	*	What type of engineer? I'm mechanical.
t1_dskn0tj	0	*	That makes no sense. Everyone having insurance makes insurance cheaper, it's literally the most fundamental aspect of insurance. 
t1_dslnjnt	0	*	Calling a bad idea a bad idea is not suppression of free speech.
t1_dsk8lhg	0	*	>I don't like ideology at all  that's all the evidence i need. you *literally* don't understand the definition of the words you use

t1_duf5dol	0	*	It's fine, bud, just fix your shit. 
t1_dtdgd9l	0	*	The guy making light of nuclear holocaust, sure. My biggest complaint still stands, it wasn't clever or funny. At least be entertaining if you're a wanker.

t1_duvbkme	0	*	It's not part of Israel.
t1_dtogp7d	0	*	So you didn't. Thanks. Also, Italy isn't 98% white. It's around 1.5% white at best.
t1_dtp9d07	0	*	This reads like it was from 1800s justification of why we have to oppress natives
t1_dtol5ic	0	*	From what I've gathered the Falangists became rather obsolete, with Franco turning to others for economic guidance among other things. They still exist, but there just... there I guess?
t1_dtov8nc	1	*	Lmaoooo, this dude is claiming it's easier to be black. They get all the breaks!.  Can you imagine if dude was black and how much he would complain then?
t1_dtolpql	1	*	> and make some sort of a movement that discredits BLM.  So as it should be, then.
t1_dtoya17	0	*	What happened was the Union was reinforcing Ft. Sumter in preparation for conflict. So the Confederacy put a stop to that. Ish. 
t1_dtdcjv7	0	*	Keep going. This is hilarious (if not a bit sad) lol

t1_dv1feqr	0	*	Actuallly selective breeding is patentable.
t1_dv1knvy	1	*	Youre a legend.  In your own mind.  Just remember its disingenuous to embrace science only when it fits your ideology.  You either believe in it, or you dont. 
t1_dv0zhrb	1	*	The point is should bring back assault weapons because they obviously lower gun deaths
t1_dv2wbv2	0	*	I'm Norwegian. This whole argument is insane to me. 
t1_dulk3xa	0	*	Because it's such a basic thing to do in politics.  It's like fucking up basic hygiene, it shows you're incompetent.
t1_dulqe6b	0	*	Weak relative to where it should be given where it started is different from weak relative to West Africa. But since you obviously dont want to actually have a productive debate, we can end it here. 
t1_duhy3cr	0	*	Well it was fun while it lasted
t1_dul1rc1	0	*	Well maybe if you want people to care, you can't just tell them how oh don't worry everyone cares and giving them a false sense of comfort.
t1_dugopys	0	*	Maybe I've just had good luck. Not everyone is peachy, but I've never had the displeasure of a group ruining it for everyone. Minus Russians.

t1_du52sgu	1	*	I confur. 
t1_dtbpym3	1	*	What about the comment *exactly* makes it so obvious? Run down your train of thought for me so that perhaps my clearly inferior brain can understand.
t1_ds6r70u	0	*	Yep, confusing. But it looked like things went positive when TIL was employed. Rarely is TIL followed up with Now eff off.
t1_du0ot2o	1	*	Hey don't be so hard on yourself sometimes you're wrong and sometimes you're right. Eventually you'll be right and it'll feel good!

t1_dsz5ooz	1	*	It is nowhere near *only* $30 for an er visit.  An ambulance ride, alone is ~$1000 plus an average cost of around $1,200 for the ER.   Many (most?) er visits are poor replacing a GP with the ER.

t1_dta8cx5	1	*	Doesn't seem to be working too well for the green and libertarian parties.  Also, the fact that you think a disparity of 3 million votes is mob rule is a little ridiculous.

t1_dulp917	0	*	Look man if you want to insult me that probably just means you have nothing actual to say. I told you my opinion some other dude in the thread linked some scientific articles.

t1_dsflo35	0	*	It's just that bringing it up like this implies you hold a grudge, and I'm wondering why.
t1_duwqmyr	1	*	Agreed. There's no reason for it to ever be under the authority of anyone else.

t1_du9cq8x	0	*	Thanks for the helpful tip, but I'm sorry, I'm going to have to cut this conversation short.

t1_du7bt6p	1	*	I mean with the red line, many neocons wanted a full invasion
t1_dsk6c8g	0	*	You suggest it though, otherwise you would have conceded that in yout original reply. After all, you are the one who excels in reading comments and gets everything right.

t1_dsv7b5q	1	*	How would taking the Haitian workers impact in any way Indian immigrants???????????????
t1_dsygu0h	0	*	No but giving jobs to people who under normal circumstances would not have that job prospect is certainly charitable. 
t1_dsuty6t	0	*	> You could simply read the article we are commenting on.  Yep, pretty unambiguous.
t1_dsusxmp	1	*	And that's what they are doing here to Trump. They literally voted for a wall before but now it's racist. At some point we have s to stop acting like acting like toddlers yelling he started it. 
t1_dsvbmkf	0	*	Welcome to r/worldnews where facts are racist and truth are lies.  Sometimes I really hate this website. Good on you for fighting agasint the grain.

t1_dsuxzj9	0	*	Nope Trump blew that out of the water. Trump has lied more in one year than every other president combined. 
t1_dt0cbkw	1	*	Nationalist =/= Nazi. Im sure Nazis would be retarded enough to think their soil is what defines them, regular Nationalists dont, hence **Nation**alist

t1_dsxn38u	1	*	What hypocrisy.
t1_dstf8gk	0	*	Cognitive dissonance -the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs or attitudes.   Not relating eating chicken with dead foxes and chickens is cognitive dissonance. A common one, but still.
t1_dstcefh	1	*	Is there evidence it is real? What is the point of arguing? 
t1_dssl9ot	0	*	So you are assuming that the other books are not intended to be interpreted literally?
t1_dssky3s	1	*	You're right, hearing about that should be enough. But we aren't smart enough.  Hearing about how beautiful a place is, is enough to appreciate it. But experiencing it is a whole other level. 
t1_dsvomji	1	*	You're welcome hope it leads to something :)
t1_dt3zwep	0	*	So youre not Chinese? That would make more sense. 
t1_dtggqcx	0	*	H-he talked about being prosperous!  Under TRUMP!!!!!
t1_dtg4nzq	1	*	For that to be a counterpoint, it had to respond to a point - which there was none. It was more of a good dismissal of bitching and crying. 
t1_dtgcx5z	1	*	Unless you're a billionaire and don't care about money I guess. But then I wouldn't be eating avocado toast.
t1_dtggo5y	0	*	You said voting in Texas won't affect the presidential election.   Direct quote. False.

t1_dtgourf	0	*	Things in different places cost different due to local economy. Youre not stupid for paying local prices. Some guy in Vietnam would be equally wrong to judge your food prices.
t1_dtvrhjy	0	*	Go ahead, keep focusing on 1000 killed by Israelis while 100,000s get killed by muslims and peace keepers sent in to control the mess. See where that will get you.

t1_dtizod8	1	*	Where do you think they are banned from dressing how they want to? That's right. In both places in different ways.
t1_dtdus74	1	*	I'm not even going to dignify that ridiculous question with an answer. There is about as much chance of Merkhel killing her enemies as Putin is, they have both been in power a long time.  
t1_dsaeeaj	0	*	Yeah you're right animal rights is way more important than exploitative industry. Fuck your animals and fuck their rights. Meat will always be on the menu.

t1_durtq01	0	*	By rounding, you have that exact same disconnect at 360,001 and 1,079,999 people, both of which get one rep. How would a different number of representatives change this?
t1_dszq4y8	1	*	> you're arguing against, which is that the tax cut will not increase GDP growth enough to bring the tax base up to a level where standard of living benefits exist  Standard of living =/= tax base

t1_dt8a092	0	*	Casual reminder that you're more likely to die in childbirth in Texas than any other developed region in the world. But its cool, you guys seem to have your shit figured out.
t1_dtc5pfc	1	*	Lol you should try it, it's really good.  Adios.
t1_dt8z8xn	0	*	All you did was provide baseless numbers on your own experience. Then discribed a bunch of strawpeople living beyond their means.   
t1_dt7fo53	0	*	Still only max. 670$/year though. Maybe that's more than it sounds like.
t1_dt6vtam	1	*	First, they do it too is playground logic, second I never said righties are any better anyway.
t1_dt6nnz5	1	*	Thank you for taking the time to discuss the issue even if we disagree.  Youre a rare poster and I would gild you if I could.  I will take your citations seriously and review for further education.
t1_dt6xyqc	0	*	Given that it's less than 10%, it's a bit of a stretch to say demographic change. There's new demographics, but demographics as a whole haven't really changed.
t1_dupdfym	1	*	Not through text on the internet.
t1_dsx3zqo	1	*	If you look at how Russia is pumping up their population, it has very nationalistic tones. Which makes their ironic the west are all nazis claims hilarious.   Putin is a master troll
t1_dub94cs	0	*	The article is pretty short and to the point. There's nothing there about hate speech. Being defensive over being wrong isn't a good look for you.
t1_dswq3ho	0	*	I disagree on shortcuts when it comes to violating human rights, screwing over the environment, and having a disregard to other countries rules.

t1_dsmjfiy	0	*	Thats the sequitor. The topics are related. Therefore not whataboutism. 
t1_dsmhmyy	0	*	I don't live in Florida, but from what I've heard, Rick Scott sounds like a total dick.
t1_dsodntw	1	*	Well conduct drills obviously, but Russia has taken the initiative to intimidate allies through stuff like invading airspace, we can do the same.
t1_dt5zn8i	1	*	Thanks, that explains it.

t1_dt5mf4c	1	*	Reread the conversation before you jump and and start spewing nonsense 
t1_dt61efz	1	*	I'm just saying many mistakes stem from the people as well, not just the representatives. Especially when it comes to voting, people get lazy too often and it backfires almost every time.
t1_dt5iq9s	1	*	I lived there for a few months when I was a little kid while my dad was stationed there. That idone of the few memories I have of Mississippi, thankfully.
t1_dt5i8s6	1	*	Your country defines income per capita as GDP per capita   You get paid just a bit more than Alabamans, much less than Americans as a whole

t1_du4oofx	1	*	well then switch it to his point. You don't have to get defensive and then personally attack someone because of a simple error. 
t1_du511hr	1	*	Nuts.  Well, thanks for clarifying. Not sure where I came up with my version of the 25th Amendment. 
t1_dspfexg	1	*	you keep up the personal attacks because you tried arguing something that is outright false. Typical.
t1_dsk0w9p	0	*	so your it corruption because your state had long running rules about only party members voting in a primary that you could have educated yourself on?
t1_dtwe53y	0	*	>You had 13 comment karma this morning

t1_dv0xs3h	1	*	I don't use twitter
t1_dv0t2m0	1	*	You should be, just like you should be free to respond to a holocaust denier with pictures taken by the camp liberators.  Showing the ugly truth about something should never be forbidden.

t1_dsi5gbk	0	*	Did you *actually* read it? When all you can contruubute is an ad hominem, maybe you ought to reconsider who's bringing anything to the table. Enjoy your ignorance.
t1_dtjefjr	1	*	Oh you can react how ever you wish as long as its peaceful, that's what makes free speach so great!
t1_dsagb1i	0	*	The news and the people who I have talked to, really. The methods typically employed other than being a pollster I suppose

t1_ds6l6xr	1	*	Not saying you should necessarily, which is why CNN should have released the video. Just saying that people say dumb shit when emotional and those listening should probably not act on what they said. 
t1_ds4s87s	0	*	It's true! I'm lazily laying in bed, even. Not working! The horror!
t1_ds7qvs1	1	*	yes it does. annexing a region which is ethnically full of your people because they want to be part of your country is way more morally justified than robbing a country for oil
t1_ds4seig	1	*	You're right, senators and house representatives can occasionally be elected off schedule when they retire or become incapable of holding office.
t1_ds64qem	1	*	The Soviet Union was a good thing to keep around.
t1_dsulmgl	0	*	No because anything more left than Hilary Clinton is apparently radical left. That's literally the stupidest shit I've ever heard. 
t1_dstxe2y	0	*	Because the articles have consequences if they report wrong information. Wikipedia does not, and it isnt always accurate.

t1_dtr8qcd	0	*	edit: nvm i read your username

t1_dstutn7	0	*	Yes I do.  There are many people, for example, that believe that standing up during or after sex prevents pregnancy.  
t1_dv4j1tg	1	*	We don't need to though.  All we have to do to defeat russia is keep the sanctions in place and continue to let the oligarchs steal all the country's wealth.

t1_dsjwr7p	1	*	do you think you are making an argument here? you're just proving that Democrats are better people than Republicans.
t1_dut2yb1	0	*	That is a great point.  It's also notable that their main political opponent is floundering currently, so the IOC may lack the teeth it had a few years ago.

t1_duwe3ie	0	*	Dont pretend you read.
t1_du4gycb	1	*	This has nothing to do with fasting.    Its about the end of days. Which is a unique event.    Dude which scholar told you this was a reason for the chamging of fasting times?
t1_dtqdi7g	0	*	https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7v5vi0/the_latest_italian_gunman_suspected_in_the/dtq7a0f/  you, like an hour ago   It's not even ironic. You're just r/imversmart material in a nutshell.
t1_dtraaz6	0	*	Lol, i think you need a girlfriend mate.   You can do lots of research on the inadequacies of the former 457 scheme to determine the issues around worker safety and exploitation. Perhaps you should. 
t1_dsbq71i	0	*	See, thats the difference between us:  Im pointing out flaws in your argument, and youre projecting 
t1_dsb2kcm	0	*	Great. In order for that system to work, shouldn't we also make sure that 11 million people aren't bypassing it? I presume you don't think we can let in an unlimited amount, right? 
t1_dsb32bb	1	*	You too :)
t1_dsb8103	1	*	The depressing part is that none of this information will change this guy's mind, or even prompt him to research the topic more.
t1_dscphzh	0	*	The idea that money has no relationship to quality of education provided is bizzaro. If that was the case then the entire private school system wouldn't exist. 
t1_dsb9p6g	0	*	Yes and you should read the full quote and not pick out six words.  
t1_dw2jphp	1	*	Ah, makes sense. Thanks!
t1_dtxij6y	1	*	Yeah, especially if I was studying or doing it part time
t1_dtxdoxe	0	*	In Canada, Asian usually means East Asian (like in US)
t1_dswnnyo	1	*	straw man
t1_dswscfx	1	*	It is though, you're talking about a self-defense situation versus a health-risk situation, and considering health outcomes in Canada, you are in fact Strawmaning. 
t1_dswm4rf	1	*	You asked if you were violating their right to choose, and yes, in Canada, you are.   Take your attitude elsewhere. You clearly do not know what you are talking about.
t1_dswrs8p	1	*	Thanks fellow American. As Americans we really need to stick together.
t1_dswnput	0	*	can it get any cheaper? I mean, look at the low quality of your argument.
t1_dswy7r6	1	*	Because we value human life over animal life. As we should
t1_dt0elqa	1	*	not really. 
t1_dswz7u6	1	*	>How can you be pro-choice regarding rape, but in your next breath say that it should be illegal in general?  Because they have no idea what they are talking about.
t1_dsxpnpj	0	*	Yes they do!! You'd love it. It's dirt cheap to live in Georgia because no one has any money (red states amirite). I'd gladly trade here for anywhere on your side of the border
t1_dswsoqu	0	*	I think that's called giving it up for adoption. and in the case of a mother leaving it with a father, that same legal disavowal would have to be an option.
t1_dswncso	0	*	Sorry.. what are you saying, exactly? In that kind of scenario, someone would be justified in physically restraining the woman until she gave birth?
t1_dsx1puq	1	*	Its ironic that pro choice people dont advocate pro choice of others 
t1_dswqwxn	0	*	If it's by their own bad judgment it is
t1_dswqde6	0	*	Exactly, so therefore thinking that abortion should be illegal cannot possibly be discrimination. 
t1_dsy28xn	0	*	Its a touch too authoritarian for my tastes.   Im not even on that (pro life) side, but I do balk at pushy divisive things like this.
t1_dsxep18	1	*	Awkward 
t1_dtfh1ds	0	*	I didnt say it was, I said that the recovery was. I never did say that one and two were false, so I dont know why you brought them up. 
t1_ds1jmxb	0	*	Except that's what I'm discussing and I have been.   So you basically lost and now you're running and hiding.
t1_ds13uye	0	*	Not at all.   Since this is the best response you can come up with, I know i've won the argument. 
t1_ds6kyd8	1	*	Cause 60% is very different from 50% + 1. 50% means that the country can stay or leave the EU because of one person. That's absurd.
t1_duruqv7	0	*	Vietnam were actually the ones who invaded and overthrew the Khmer Rouge. Much of the west still recognized them as the 'real' government anyway.
t1_duvd38f	1	*	Europe had to build smaller cities in order to make them easier to protect against invaders.  For most of history, Europe was a really shitty place to live.
t1_duuq8r6	1	*	My reply to this would just be circling back to points already made so I think this is the end of the line. We just disagree on the impact and severity and I don't think we will agree.
t1_dtb5u08	0	*	That's what I thought :)
t1_dt9krje	0	*	https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/07/01/how-the-iraq-war-still-haunts-new-york-times/199946
t1_dt9rkpc	0	*	Mexico...?  and California votes blue every presidential election. The only reason they produce so much food is to make wine... which at that point isnt food anymore. 
t1_dtk5qih	1	*	At what point did I imply that?  You said gerrymandering got Trump elected, which I pointed out as inaccurate. You haven't refuted that point. IDK what you're on about other than that.
t1_duohuko	0	*	Having observed this whole conversation, it's quite obvious that you're the troll here. Calling other people a troll instead of responding to an argument or actually making a point was my first clue.
t1_dthlzzn	0	*	So, by your logic, because bad things have been done before, we should let them keep happening? Settlements in Israel are actively removing people from their land and homes.
t1_dsez421	1	*	That's all I'm saying.
t1_dukasw5	0	*	Haha... You litterally made the word antisemitic valueless. You're a bigot and a coward, will you delete this comment too?
t1_dsqjosb	0	*	[Take a look for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmXPeSzlc6A)
t1_dtotjan	0	*	16%, could you share a valid source on that with me? That's the first I'm hearing of it, or I might have read it and forgotten.
t1_dthl76z	0	*	More like I believe the American intelligence agencies over the AP
t1_duevgee	0	*	I didn't imply sending more troop; refusing to leave when asked to is enough for an illegitimate presence.
t1_duifbuw	1	*	I remember Digg going down the drain too.  Remember AOL chatrooms though?  Those were the bomb.
t1_ds72dll	0	*	But if a strong currency was not desirable, why would the UK not bail on the pound?
t1_ds9xf2f	1	*	http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/chinese-police-italy-rome-milan-tourists/index.html  that stuff scares me
t1_ds6wilu	0	*	Look at all these traitors of the republic in red. LOL.   and look at all the sheep in big cities   http://metrocosm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/election-map-by-county-3d-1.png
t1_dth533h	0	*	Antifa labels anybody they disagree with as nazi's, therein lies the problem.
t1_dv4pt5e	0	*	> So black people are Nazis now?   Really? We are going to sink to this level of argument?
t1_dt8gifp	1	*	More irrelevant and false conjecture. Go somewhere else if you don't like it, the land always belonged to the Palestinian people. 
t1_duclofv	1	*	> Not guilt, responsibility.    you're repeating yourself. I have nothing more to say.  
t1_dswvra6	0	*	Oh my God... You are a tragic figure... You have to parent the children when they fall out of mom's vagina sweetie...  Back to your mother's basement troll.  You have no power here. 
t1_ds8d4co	1	*	Do you know what sentient means?
t1_duvznpz	1	*	Opening themselves up to liability   Look, if you think they're just flat out making shit up and printing what they know are lies, we don't have anywhere to go from here. 
t1_ds3mq5b	0	*	Because they aren't and they neither side wants them to be.  I agree on one thing this would all be a nonissue if Jordan was told to take the citizens when they retreated.
t1_dszn52p	0	*	If he secretly agrees with their positions. I can't make this any simpler...
t1_dsjkiqu	1	*	A **crime** is an un**law**ful act punishable by a state or other authority. If there is no **law** there is no **crime**.   Words have meanings. Any toddler can tell you.
t1_dsjmpys	0	*	I mean, it isn't. You're saying this shows that no go zones due to immigrants exist. The report just says that there exist some rougher areas, which is the case for literally every country on earth. 
t1_dsk5qvv	1	*	I looked through the stats.  Best I could find was a survey rather than actual stats unfortunately, but that also didn't seem to have data showing country of origin or anything about refugee status.
t1_dsjjzm6	1	*	Not just now, been corrupt since Nixon. Shamefully.
t1_dsjkrt5	1	*	Exactly
t1_dsjfocr	1	*	Just bury your head in the sand please.  Have a good one, stop responding.  No point in discussing this with you
t1_dsjxebs	0	*	I meant the problem is that we have a system that allows someone who receives less votes to win the election. 
t1_dsjlwia	0	*	Did you even read the article before you posted it?  From your link: Effectively, the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirms that there is no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment.
t1_dsjpxft	0	*	Yes, I know Democrats have fucked up. But the Republicans try to use that fact to deflect attention from their crimes.  
t1_dsk11u9	1	*	dw, you won't be. Wanna join us for dinner?
t1_dt209mn	0	*	Maybe. SA has a history of treating people as groups rather than as individuals. Has it lead to peace and justice?
t1_dsr1bh3	0	*	If you could, you would. You did neither.
t1_dtty8vz	1	*	> My God...  Oh, you're on of those religious people. I should have realized. No wonder.
t1_durval3	1	*	There are certainly levels of oppression. If theres a level of oppression where civilians shooting stuff doesnt end with you either getting arrested or totally outgunned and killed, its razor-thin.
t1_durxa26	1	*	If youre arguing for raisin that age, Id say that I agree.   What im saying is that our laws already should have prevented this shooting,  but didnt. Laws surrounding gun control arent going to help.
t1_durb4gl	0	*	I hear ad hominem are in season this time of year.
t1_dur7ar0	0	*	No, it comes out to 0.00002, which is not the same as as 0.00002%. I cannot believe I have to explain this to someone who is presumably a grown adult.
t1_durbs9t	1	*	Yea, Yeap that's right. Thanks. Im uh, bad at stuff, and things.

t1_dui3qk1	0	*	You said a thing? Well I'm going to say that thing back to you! Haha let's see how you like it!
t1_dui5bmd	0	*	The same thing should theoretically happen if most men dropped out of the workforce, which is closer to what's happening, but I don't see any increase in wages. 
t1_duip035	1	*	I live in a small town (15k pop.) and the income range me and most of my friends are in is about 30-50k a year.
t1_dui85q9	1	*	A russian mechanic once told me. Watch out for a mechanic with all his fingers intact, no good mechanic has 10 fingers.   A true statement
t1_dtsv1kl	0	*	> Another falsehood from you  LOL!!  This post somehow gets *worse* from here....   What...what do you think the word democracy means?

t1_ds7o0cq	1	*	lol
t1_ds7v9pj	0	*	You apparently feel like it's impossible for the propellant to have zero effect? The dude provided lots of reasons why it doesn't but you just keep sayin 'but that's not how I feel like it works'. 
t1_dsq05t5	1	*	I stand by my fundie comment when you are so adamant about telling me what I believe.
t1_duj0ar6	1	*	;)
t1_duz3zwy	0	*	I'm sorry, but you are dismissing out of hand the effectiveness of a small number of highly motivated individuals who are heavily armed.
t1_duy8224	0	*	Because people killing killing themselves are concerned about making sure they follow the law. Dang suicide is illegal, too bad. Why not just make gun violence illegal. 
t1_ds9y2cw	1	*	Yawn.
t1_dtjlfi2	0	*	So they're stupid...
t1_ds3sskf	0	*	What about my second question? Is that too arrogant to answer as well?
t1_dskx02o	0	*	So what you're saying is that a woman cleaning toilets right now can be a software engineer in the future?
t1_dste1hs	1	*	Teehee. 
t1_dsoi8d0	0	*	who's accepted them? I see people debating them all the time as they should. Who the hell endorsed the KKK or nazis? If that happened it would be on the news for years to come.
t1_dso37hb	0	*	Wow.  Just.  Put down the fedora.  Actions have consequences.  This guy tried to put his own stubborn version of reality into play and it didnt work.  You should learn this.

t1_dso3z95	0	*	FYI, you spelled stupid wrong.
t1_dso849i	1	*	No. My company doesn't find pride or accomplishment all that important :)
t1_dsomw5a	0	*	So instead of states with the most people, you want elections decided by swing States? How is that fair to the states with the most people? Why doesn't my vote matter if I'm not in a swing state?
t1_dsodgdk	0	*	Exactly.  Not a damn thing.  But doesn't stop you retards from screaming about it.  Good job!
t1_dtfm3m5	1	*	It's ongoing, we're not dead or destroyed yet. Naysayers claimed we'd all be destroyed a week after brexit vote. 
t1_dtrmo18	1	*	WESTWARD expansion... WEST. Yes, it doesnt count when youre not talking about the thing everyone else is talking about.
t1_du544nz	0	*	There may not be a good way. But allowing them to commit genocide/torture/rape/abortion of citizens en masse is the worst possibility.

t1_du592w2	1	*	I'd rather try Portugals model of no drugs being illegal and actually providing treatment centers.  Rather that than just jailing people and ruining their lives for the sake of profit

t1_dudvp25	1	*	Not necessarily?
t1_dteviku	0	*	So what's so different about that policy in the US?  So far it seems like the only difference you can point to is that Trump doesn't care if he sounds like a dick about it.
t1_dscg0ay	1	*	You - *VIOLENTLY RIPS HAIR OUT Me - good.

t1_dv02azk	0	*	One of you said I always take these people's side and the other said depends on the situation.  If he was taking your position on whites you'd have no problem calling that racism out... 
t1_dv1kgst	0	*	The point is that it's an absurd example.  All the time we have different words for something that could be just as easily accomplished by modifying the first word. 
t1_dv030oc	0	*	That is the same thing, the white people could do the same thing and say taking back land.

t1_ds171mu	1	*	They are just puppets in fancy suits, Trump should be evidence enough.
t1_du33nkw	1	*	I'm repeating myself because what I am repeating already address what you just wrote. Maybe you can read it this time and stop making points I've already addressed.
t1_duyos6z	0	*	No, this is potentially much worse. This is potential collusion with a foreign power.  You're right, this isn't Watergate.

t1_dv2wl45	0	*	You need to be *literate* literate to see that the context was about Fake News, not is Trump good at his job? Since we're on the subject.  
t1_dv4jrks	0	*	So you believe a different voting system would change the systemic partisanship bias that this country has?
t1_duds2we	1	*	Lol yep. 
t1_dtvdone	1	*	It's addressed in the article.  Hanged is only for death by hanging from the neck.  If you were to hang somebody from their feet, you'd use hung not hanged.
t1_dtwufhn	1	*	yw :o)
t1_dtk72ef	1	*	The Israel government supports and funds settlers. Israel is fully responsible for their behavior.  They own it
t1_duxt5s3	1	*	Whatever you say beefheart. Keep that BP low and that libido lower buddy.
t1_duxfa13	0	*	Words are wind and they are still building hundreds of coal power plants
t1_ds2bthq	0	*	You disagree with israel!!!  JEW HATER JEW HATER! Quick get the nazi hes disagreeing with israel nazism must be on the rise!  Or maybe israel is just being a dick?
t1_ds209au	0	*	Again, a good start would be to read the rest of that charter you quoted from. It's not that long.
t1_dtoiqt0	1	*	Indeed, it is very unfair, as I mentioned in my original post.
t1_dt2pgxl	0	*	Jesus Christ (no pun) you are dense.  [Read this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory) Fuck off. Go bother someone else. Your country is fucked and does not deserve salvation.
t1_dt2qavw	0	*	Youre not proving anything by *continuing* to act like a dick.
t1_dt34jib	1	*	Its hard to defend the power than organized religion gives to its leaders. That power is almost always sought after by evil folks.
t1_dt5z5ev	1	*	Or you just have nothing better to do with your time and will continuously deflect anything Trump-related.      Good luck in life.
t1_dt301fr	1	*	People who smoke weed are statistically less successful than people who don't get #rekt
t1_dsc28ud	1	*	Thanks mate. 
t1_dse5csp	1	*	Irrelevant. You were still conflating lack of belief with a belief. There *is* a difference. Examining Atheism vs Agnosticism is just a relevant way to point that out.
t1_dtqs4o7	0	*	People should know what they're dealing with before they waste their time.
t1_dt99g4c	0	*	True but when someone gets angered when you talk about stuff, its not worth it.
t1_dtev81p	0	*	Huh. You're right. I have no idea why I thought that was the case... I even remembered the scene with the lion being anorectic and coughing weakly.
t1_dtoc45d	0	*	Any scientist who claims somethimg without taking into consideration reasonable doubt also isn't qualified to comment on the subject matter.
t1_dv4wvyx	0	*	I dont know what you are trying to say. My point is that just saying grenade is trying to push an agenda.
t1_dv51758	0	*	eh, makes sense to me  if some jews invaded the US and declared this country their new homeland I would be pretty pissed
t1_dugaz1q	0	*	Ignoring my main point which is cars aren't purpose built for murder, it's just an unfortunate side effect of giving high speed lumps of metal to every Joe Schmoe. 
t1_dtf627s	0	*	You are correct. My mistake.  That does not negate the validity of the rest of my comment.
t1_dtbslvh	0	*	How did you get on with Obama then?
t1_dtda112	0	*	look it up in a dictionary. 
t1_dsc6p0h	0	*	It's not about me, it's about those Chinese peacekeepers.   Try to stay on target with this discussion.
t1_dsn9wup	0	*	So just wondering, do you consider North Korea a democracy?
t1_dsnagf0	0	*	So far you havent provided a single point to refute
t1_du797us	0	*	And no reason to be a sad little bitch. I'll be alright. Just avoid me if you don't like me. 
t1_dthcho5	1	*	I appreciate the extra description, it's more information, and it's useful information. 
t1_dulxrgo	0	*	And all the cops who are put on administrative leave and eventually come back to work? The 99.9% that havent committed crimes? Its ok to not pay them? 
t1_dscpphv	0	*	Do you know the origin of the balfour declaration and how it came to be?
t1_dsa8irq	0	*	Ok, guess you still didn't look up the law. Plus you aren't really making that much sense anymore. So consider this argument over. ;)  Have a nice one.
t1_dtmufra	1	*	Wow. Professional gymnasts couldn't do as extreme a stretch as that is to your original claim.
t1_dtnihl4	1	*	But they are self-proclaimed experts on shithole countries theyve never been to!  
t1_dsoykdo	0	*	It was pretty selfless, seems you honestly would help someone without thinking of yourself or ambitions. Its inspiring.
t1_dunyk2r	0	*	So what you're saying is the laws on the books aren't being enforced.
t1_duomckv	1	*	Or yunno, a stolen vehicle.
t1_duq85k4	0	*	So why do you want to take away their means of protection?
t1_dtimuew	0	*	No legal right under the laws you follow, but every legal right under the laws he follows.  And I don't know about you but I tend not to be liable for contracts my grandfather signed.
t1_dtj5p3o	0	*	Seems like there's more going on here than simply dying from lack of sleep, but I am ignorant about the disease. Still, an otherwise healthy person who stays awake for a couple weeks will not die. 
t1_dtiuou0	1	*	That's why POWs are an exception - because neither is reasonable in their case.
t1_dtiu4ll	1	*	It was legal before too. The 13th amendment just carved out an exception for prisoners when outlawing slavery. 
t1_dtj12gy	1	*	Because many people would call their family being thrown in prison in the first place torture. If mentally healthy people voluntarily do it, like Steven Crowder and journalists, it's not torture. 
t1_dtih2cx	0	*	You're trying to deflect the accusation and making it sound like its okay because everyone else is corrupt.
t1_dtim262	1	*	>Bottom line, Obama killed more people, in more places, than Bush ever did.  Do you have a source for that claim? 
t1_dtii8nw	0	*	I'm not sure what you are trying to pry out from me. I don't support GTMO in any way or manner.  And yes, the UN has classified most of those as international conflicts where the conventions apply.
t1_dtitth0	1	*	That's why he's...  Got this speaking pattern...   Where he...   Has pauses between a small amount...   Of words. 
t1_dtiw1ee	1	*	> I guess I'll have to take your word for it  
t1_dth4m4y	0	*	lmao..that guy does sound scared to say something bad about putin.
t1_dv2ti81	1	*	If a bit of snark is uncivil then I guess I'm a savage to the people I see in my day to day life.
t1_du7veyt	0	*	That's the problem though, you don't think.   
t1_ds8xhmf	1	*	Yeah, he just has a mad at the world vibe. Weird. 
t1_ds8xc02	1	*	Droops Magoop Boop Doop
t1_ds9l3q6	0	*	Depends how we want to define right. I also don't want to go down the road of talking about Hitler, simply because anything i say can be misconstrued as supporting him. 
t1_dt1dki2	0	*	He ordered the spying for Hillary. Fuck them both. Hang them high.
t1_dt17pkl	1	*	>You have to be pretty stupid to  Say this when there are multiple proven instances when the media outright lied about things that Trump did/didn't do.
t1_dszo43z	0	*	Ok fine, give me your paycheck and I'll make sure our air quality is a little better. 
t1_dt04ps1	1	*	Goddamn, you are like the Stephen Hawking of being a complete fucking idiot.  How's it feel to be wrong about everything all of the time?
t1_dtjh1g3	0	*	That's a weird thing about US, you rely on the generosity of the individual but have hoardes of homeless who are bankrupt from healthcare. Strange.
t1_dtjn5uh	0	*	Except I'm not making any claims at all. I am questioning yours, are you aware how this works?
t1_dtj9m9i	0	*	I've always understood it as sort the bottom shit out first, then when you're good there start looking at the next level and so on til we're all  Gandhi. Have I misunderstood? 
t1_dtv1z2m	0	*	Except that didn't happen.
t1_dtft70c	0	*	ADHD can be a challenge, I suggest you speak with your doctor, friend.
t1_du7tmtn	1	*	Is this a trick question?
t1_du73yry	0	*	Reddit is garbage.   
t1_du73zuk	0	*	Thats very nice but it doesn't change the fact that Hamas uses world provided aid money to buy rockets and build tunnels to attack Israel.
t1_du81lnv	1	*	Haha nice but old classic joke
t1_du93j9l	1	*	I know this thread is from a few days ago, but what do you know: https://pitchfork.com/news/lawmaker-calls-for-lorde-florida-concert-cancellations-over-israel/
t1_du6sc61	0	*	I don't hate Israel. They could do good things, but I'm not going to turn a blind eye when they murder kids and teenagers just like I don't when the US does it.
t1_du6ojw1	0	*	No.....controlling the borders of a country is not controlling a country. 
t1_ds2lm4x	0	*	Um, guess you are right. Thanks for the correction. I tend to be on the offensive when it comes to the conceptualization of evolution. I'll be more careful in the future!
t1_dup9oxd	0	*	Why not? 
t1_du4i0ua	0	*	See my comment one up from that one.
t1_ds1gqtq	1	*	Like what? He's done a lot for one year
t1_ds1hvbx	0	*	Whatabout whataboutism. 
t1_ds2s0bg	1	*	Nice
t1_ds1i5g5	0	*	A couple decades until the land is livable, gamma radiation doesn't last long in a lot of things, it will be there for 10000 years but at safe levels
t1_ds1icql	0	*	Why would it be stupid?
t1_ds1tepi	0	*	At some point they need to put that behind them and get along with each other... But I suspect that day is years away as they'll continue to blame Europeans and the Jews for all their problems.
t1_ds3gsbl	0	*	Show me your source for that fact
t1_ds1gb3p	1	*	What we really need is an Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban and that allows all Muslim extremists safe harbour. Nothing could go wrong with that plan. 
t1_ds1ga25	1	*	We left because there was protests from people not wanting to volunteer to be war fodder. People don't want to walk through a jungle just to attract enemy fire and get ambushed, go figure.
t1_ds1m5iw	0	*	Since when are they unprotected?
t1_ds1l0un	0	*	So Obama had a complex situation on his hands... but not Trump... he's just incompetent
t1_ds1kv79	1	*	I didn't see the movie, but it was certainly about Cruise flying cocaine for the CIA. I imagine it didn't have much to do with coke in the inner city, but I would assume the show Dope on FX does. 
t1_ds1jqat	1	*	What a fantasy you live in. I'm sure you have never had your ass beat by a guy with an SS tattoo, ever. Nor will you ever. 
t1_ds1rl1t	0	*	Wow way to change the goalposts there 
t1_ds1rhsb	0	*	I stopped reading after you said you couldn't read my idiot comment.  >That's why people who support him think you're an idiot
t1_ds1l69t	1	*	Lol
t1_ds1gnqy	0	*	You are pretty ignorant to the problem. 
t1_ds1p1qa	1	*	Yes, Russia does. 
t1_dtqao00	0	*	Jews have right of return. Arabs do not. Thats not equality. Thats racism.
t1_dtr1hdl	0	*	There's noway I'm going to be able to convince you that you should care about people other than you're own kind. So why should I bother wasting my time?
t1_du2uq7k	0	*	Lol, youre really going out your way to try making me seem wrong and you right. I cant really be bothered with this argument anymore so okay, you win :) 
t1_dsq3mkv	0	*	Turned out the girl did it herself. One might guess she didn't quite like her hijab U0001f914  This is funny on so many levels
t1_duszn6o	0	*	theres hawkish/dovish sides just like in politics anywhere. you cant assume everyone in SK has same opinion.  especially with NKs history of killing South Koreans  http://www.bbc.com/news/10130248
t1_du33ijw	1	*	I don't live in Toronto anymore, so my chances of meeting Russians is very low.
t1_du36mmk	0	*	> if you're in a no way out situation... it's because you put yourself in it.   Pretty much... or you're a character in one of the final destination movies. 
t1_du37mv9	1	*	> I'm a bad driver though obviously.  you have made it clear that you are. i dont even look behind me This is basic defensive driving. Take a class, take some responsibility. 
t1_du3ofby	1	*	Now Trump is in the equation, this keeps getting better
t1_dtezy1z	0	*	Denying that race exists is delusional. Different race groups have different physical charachteristics, bone structure, different deseases, all of which is documented.
t1_dt6ho3f	0	*	Stop trying to move the goalposts. You said the only reason the Democrats were standing up for Dreamers was for a political win. That is a lie.
t1_ds4tgca	0	*	UK/US/EU/etc. they're all getting better at it.
t1_dupipw1	0	*	Theres dictators everywhere. So far it looks like General Secretary Xi is the most benevolent of them. Better we have dictators than an anarchic wasteland, which the US has the credit for liberating
t1_du0zvu2	0	*	Read them for yourself.
t1_ds4q16r	0	*	nice personal attack
t1_dtpe2zl	1	*	Area A was handed over. Area C is under Israeli control until a final peace agreement is made.
t1_dtc8ilf	0	*	https://imgur.com/a/MjGS9
t1_dtb5tiw	0	*	You said what I said was Cold War propaganda  Would Europe not fall to communism if invaded by communists?
t1_dtbp2oq	1	*	No, no. YOURS are not universal, his are.
t1_dtephsm	1	*	You have no points.   You made a baseless assertion.   Mince back to T_D, Im sure youre regarded as a genius over there.
t1_dtafaot	1	*	Yes!!
t1_dtapy2h	1	*	She insulted an employee of the government (Beamter). That probably makes it more complicated (IANAL but Beamtenbeleidigung is kinda its own thing afaik). 
t1_dtagdc3	0	*	How does not insulting someone personally infringe on the ability to criticize someone or something? 
t1_dtdq8yh	0	*	Except its an objective ranking, not a subjective one. 17 Million is higher than 40.000 any way you look at it. 
t1_dv5t1fb	1	*	Give it time. It will come to you. 
t1_ds1uj49	0	*	Yes, she is used by the armed forces as a soldier and a propaganda tool. We agree.
t1_duaxf8h	0	*	>Moscow OKd this release for its fear factor  Nice conspiracy you got going on here please continue  As a sidenote I do think Putin is a cunt
t1_dur88jk	1	*	They already have prestige. What kind of ridiculously vague argument are you making.? 500k worth of prestige lol. This is just absurd. 
t1_duqiyzy	0	*	It was paid for by the Republican national committee and then it continued under Clinton. Omg stop drinking the Kool aid on Clinton. Make one point without bringing up Clinton. Please. Give it up.
t1_duqeph3	0	*	Guns are legal in both Mexico and Brazil 
t1_duqlpml	0	*	Cool. Let's see where it brings you 
t1_duqhfig	1	*	Im with ya there
t1_durvki1	0	*	The news media. The Press. I was assuming you were smart enough to know what we were talking about since it was obvious in the context of the conversation.
t1_durf5ho	1	*	Backed by zero evidence. 
t1_dur57b9	0	*	Well the theory above states more gouvernment control = more corruption. The nordic contries contradict the theory no matter wether they are socialist or not.
t1_duratum	1	*	Your attempts at caricature are fairly lacking.  It exacerbates the juvenile tone of your argument.
t1_duresp3	1	*	Neither do you, muppet. 
t1_durnxn0	0	*	It's not semantic games.
t1_dur5ka3	1	*	For sure, well said
t1_dsgmocg	0	*	Lol shouldn't you be cleaning toilets or handing out flyers in the UK :) Oh I forgot, they are kicking all of you beggars out :)
t1_dsfwsiq	1	*	They werent. The USSR had numerous food shortages 
t1_dsppjlh	1	*	People are so suspicious of them until they try one. Then they understand.
t1_dsp2khq	0	*	So, prosecute him?  Unless they are lying...
t1_dsou91z	0	*	Oh I definitely agree, total waste of money. I should've invested my time listening to /u/ranma_one_half instead
t1_dsl4mmn	0	*	Actually you literally can decide to pay more than the minimum....Im not sure youre understanding.  Also I pay no taxes, soooo ya
t1_dskrsxo	1	*	More personal attacks with no rebuttal. Let me know when you have something of substance to add instead of your assumptions and insults. 
t1_dskph8e	0	*	Seems like others got what I was saying but you. 
t1_dskysmy	1	*	hush now.
t1_dskucl0	0	*	You can hardly find the end of a sentence, but keep dreaming kid. Happy to school you anytime, youre dismissed.
t1_dskx8mp	0	*	And what does dick size have to do with the discussion on hand? Argue topics, there's no need for personal attacks. 
t1_dsknpp3	1	*	Oh okay. My bad. Thought it read like a dismissal by way of anecdote. Which was weird as I assume youre not Sarah palin nor a liberal feminist. Carry on. 
t1_dsl69pu	0	*	> No but it is pretty to call someone an illiterate  It's.... Pretty? Apparently I'm not the only one who has trouble reading the things you write.
t1_du81gmf	1	*	And plenty of other people have been there for just as long.  The region isn't some reserved space for them, it's been a diverse and complicated region for thousands of years.
t1_dudk92s	1	*	That is literally your argument, there is nothing more or less to it.      It's just a completely foreign concept to you that any of this is bad, nothing you said makes it look less black and white.
t1_du7gm7b	0	*	>No, you were literally explaining why Palestines stance of The Holocaust didnt go far enough was justified.   Could you link me to where I said that?
t1_du7t79w	1	*	Oh yes that would be disastrous. I just meant it being a separate state from Israel or Palestine.
t1_dshkazw	1	*	It always amazes me the lengths people will go to rationalize their magic sky wizard.
t1_duw1a59	1	*	Ah I see, I didn't know it did happen, though I knew it *would* happen. He didn't really have the luxury of safely stepping down. I see that as more a systematic issue than a personal one.
t1_dt4vgdu	1	*	Yeah points are thrown all over the place at times. Is what it is :/ cheers man
t1_dscz7q3	0	*	But you still didn't say what you were using.  
t1_dsd97cp	1	*	It kinda sounded like that. Also I agree with you but the point I was trying to make was what would one strive for once your basic needs were covered.
t1_duyymbg	0	*	Lol. GO LOOK. It is literally not my job to find you the posts. 
t1_duyp6nn	0	*	Listen,  if my house is on fire, I am not concerned about the cracks in the foundation.  
t1_dv5488n	1	*	Good effort, but wrong.  Actually, it's a terrible effort.  Rasmussen.  Try harder.  A lot harder.  Redditard. 
t1_duysqhh	0	*	They say something I don't agree with so I won't talk to them is what it boils down to. 
t1_duyj623	1	*	Le epic troll good sir, I can't wait for the green text story about it.
t1_duz4dh8	1	*	I'm sorry for my poorly worded comment. That wasn't what I intended to convey, but yes, I agree that it's confusing. 
t1_duyvs9k	0	*	Ok.. what about Micah Xavier? 
t1_duyqdtt	0	*	Do you want to? I'm not at home now but I'd be happy to share it later. Not like you'll actually read it I imagine. 
t1_dv1i48h	0	*	What has? I mean specifically about Trump and Russia.
t1_duzbst1	1	*	Wait, I'm sorry, am. I in the wrong argument? I am in like 3 different arguments right now. This wasn't the one about the boner?  Hang on let me find the one about voteing. 
t1_ds6qi7m	0	*	Your opinion is irrelevant.  Good luck!
t1_dujb4ry	0	*	Racist ... ? That is one of the weakest rebuttals that I've heard from a pro-Israeli supporter.
t1_du8pq65	0	*	Why there being a blockade implies that the Israeli government should provide the services that the Palestinian government received foreign aid for?  Please explain.
t1_dv5aktc	1	*	I heard a few ads, but I had to go looking for the 3ed party options. I remember being so disgusted during the summer of the campaign that I had to go find a third path. I liked Jill more then Gary. 
t1_dsfed7r	1	*	The options aren't no influence or worst in the world though, that's my point.  And obviously it's a matter of opinion. That's all these things ever are.
t1_dsq7tnj	0	*	I did not make that statement, you did.   I was inferring your point that the US was throwing its weight around and China wasn't. 
t1_dtg2lxv	0	*	I answered your question, you're making a bunch of responses to assertions that I didn't make. You didn't' even address my comment that legals have costs that illegals don't. 
t1_dul4ou4	1	*	Well, I mostly disagree with you, but that's fine.
t1_dsq6k0o	0	*	That's not how this works. You made the ridiculous claim (which still appears to be bullshit despite some cursory Googling), so you get to back it up.
t1_dsph6qt	0	*	How is this relevant
t1_dsrzsgp	0	*	Whether you see it or not, Fine people on both sides is Trump not denouncing white supremacy. I don't think that's very good.
t1_dss2ki7	0	*	hah, you've obviously never had an oxy habit or known anybody who did.
t1_dss5aoy	0	*	Are you really comparing a *statewide nuclear alarm* to a misspelled memo?  If it isn't the president's job to lead calmly and soberly during a potential nuclear crisis then what the fuck IS his job?!
t1_dsw05ey	0	*	Where do your sources get their news from?
t1_dsrt0c4	0	*	A leaderless patchwork of democracies are incapable of the unilateral action necessary to enforce a hegemon, in my opinion.
t1_dsrqx73	0	*	I bet he wouldn't say that to your founding fathers.  Fascist rhetoric should've died long ago.
t1_dslcths	1	*	You have to make sure to turn off autosaves. Then you just play and when you get to a place you like hit Alt+F4 and it will put down a marker so you can get back to that place in the future.
t1_dsl6ktb	0	*	[War crimes](https://www.counterpunch.org/2003/02/27/a-duty-to-disobey-all-unlawful-orders/).

t1_dsm2w79	1	*	uh huh.
t1_dsl2zps	1	*	actually I think we should speed up and get out in the streets.  stop talking and start helping each other imo
t1_dslmhf0	1	*	Roasted ya preeeeetty good right.  I mean the shit you said was garbage, you can at least acknowledge that amirite?
t1_ds9jt0e	0	*	Greed is a mental illness.    That's all I'm saying on that matter.  Cheers.  
t1_dtwdups	0	*	So you think we should remove anything that benefits poor people? Got it, equal taxes for everybody, poor people can't get welfare or disability, no free education.
t1_dssfijr	1	*	Extremely valid criticisms. As I said, if he's guilty I hope he spends the rest of his life in jail. 
t1_dsn2gbg	1	*	You are only aware of that if the infection get great enough to warrant a fever. Most of bacteria gets dealt with without having to heat up the body.
t1_dsmb499	0	*	Plants aren't conscious. 
t1_dupps2w	0	*	Fair enough, thanks for the chat.
t1_dup3nm8	0	*	Yea, sorry about that. I was already discussing this for an hour before your comment popped up so I responded to your question aggressively.  You're right. Sorry.
t1_durlkl4	0	*	Wait, really?  Damn your sources are *bad*.  [Here, have 7 that pop up pretty damn fast when you google them.](http://atlantablackstar.com/2013/12/05/7-midieval-african-kingdoms/)
t1_dumkj57	1	*	No, I'm just saying that humans tend to have different opinions in general and high numbers like that don't tend to be achieved naturally?
t1_dulz7fm	1	*	Yeah just like Bush's either you're with us or against us, got it
t1_dulsji6	1	*	They're still not terrorist organizations. Terrorists specifically have political aims.  No one's arguing that drug cartels are *good*, mind. But they're not the same thing.
t1_dum9jv6	0	*	We were talking about the Cold War not Obama, the fact that it makes Obama look bad is irrelevant. 
t1_dulm6ez	0	*	Egypt and Israel probably do not agree.  I mean, or anyone with any knowledge of history at all, but especially them.
t1_dulsvsc	1	*	You will notice that the term is used primarily to refer to political groups who just happen to also sell drugs to raise funds, rather than businesses that are also violent.
t1_dt7bjqi	0	*	DC just has just 600 times the population of vatican city. If they cant be a state, then neither should be Alaska, the Dakotas, Vermont or Wyoming who all have comparable populations.
t1_duarjoj	1	*	In what way? Secret phrases?
t1_dua76il	0	*	right thanks for avoiding the point.
t1_dscf37g	1	*	I guess I'm too out of touch then. I'm also not American so maybe things are just different here.
t1_dscf43v	0	*	no, because the person you responded to was comparing European countries to the muslim world. please keep on topic.
t1_dshz998	1	*	I could, but I would be wasting time with you. The America you buy into is a fraud and ironically hurt you own people. I hope one day you can see that.
t1_dsc31zi	1	*	oh yeah killing your daughters and wives in the name of allah definitely came from nowhere
t1_dsca09g	0	*	And why I still live in Brazil  Besides the fact that I don't have enough money to go somewhere better. Oh, well...
t1_dscgdnt	1	*	Woosh
t1_dukkipr	1	*	I could care less about the guy, what do you want me to believe?
