t1_dtz6gda	0	*	why would they, when all they get back is hate and attacks
t1_dtzehbn	1	*	Maybe we just got tired of building wells/water filtration plants only to see them blown up by the villagers themselves.
t1_dsjalc6	1	*	Wow, that's what a raging case of Corrupt Affulenza sounds like.
t1_ducyqf4	1	*	Zombie apocalypse incoming, run for your lives
t1_dubi8k7	1	*	And so it begins....
t1_dsp59l6	1	*	It's been overtaken by people mostly focused on doing what their filthy rich donors want them to do.  Cut taxes and sabotage public services so that they can sell them off to the private sphere.
t1_dsp5j4i	1	*	The same thing wrong with the Democratic party. It caters to elitist and monied interests while either completely ignoring or being openly hostile to people who do not share their viewpoints
t1_dsg717p	0	*	Catherine Deneuve isn't a hideously ugly feminist. 
t1_dsgi9s6	1	*	Thanks France for your common sense. We cant let the Anglosaxon prudes and SJW win this
t1_dtr3dcm	1	*	The ayatollah should really add The Crown to his Netflix queue. They cover this phenomenon in the first season. 
t1_duuoic3	1	*	and it seemed to completely...ruin...the city
t1_dsl68qj	1	*	...make America Norwegian again.

t1_durlg7p	1	*	I'm sure the Korean and Chinese and Filipinos will like this.  s/
t1_durmxhm	1	*	When will they stop to enshrine war criminals in their temple?
t1_durrpn6	1	*	Yeah, we attacked the West Coast of the United States with balloons.  I guess we should have researched atomic bombs, instead.
t1_durbh9d	0	*	Nuclear?
t1_durbkw6	1	*	But will they pay travel cost for those who would love to tell about the stories of comfort women?
t1_duraz58	1	*	Ehem, are they going time pay the cost of the comfort women from abroad to tell their stories too?
t1_durpmqb	0	*	Interestingly, Japan also had a nuclear weapon program at that time. Some news in media lately regarding documents found recently. Sorry don't have links.
t1_duso7bl	1	*	this fucking thread is disgusting and absolutly shows u why we need those storytellers , fingers crossed an anime release :)
t1_durpm9c	1	*	This first-hand witness testimony is of the utmost importance right now, when the US has a president who thinks there is a place for nukes on the battlefield.
t1_durtwv6	1	*	Next they need to pay for the comfort women so their story isn't forgotten as well.
t1_durertp	1	*	Will they pay for storytellers of the Rape of Nanjing or the crimes of Unit 731?
t1_durdund	1	*	let's not forget what the japanese did in WW2. 
t1_duraoud	1	*	Will they cover the costs of their victims as well?  Probably just keep denying that ever happened.
t1_durf8uj	1	*	That's a brilliant idea! So few people actually understand the horrors of nuclear war... Maybe a first hand account will help people stop their asinine We should just nuke 'em! comments.
t1_durbb1n	0	*	For the Japanese campaign and what they did going through many Asian countries do you guys think the two nukes dropped by the US was called for?
t1_dus0l27	1	*	guessing a few of the then pubescent girls...now great-grandmothers could share a story or two  https://www.vox.com/2015/12/29/10682830/comfort-women-japan-survivors 
t1_durb937	1	*	I wonder if they would do the same for Korean comfort women. 
t1_durrhn2	1	*	Fighting for power is not by massive destruction, if everyone dies who will live
t1_durpq34	1	*	Hiroshima and Nagasaki set needed examples on why nuclear war should never happen. The world has changed since WWII but looking back bombing the two cities like Coventry cut casualties on both sides.
t1_dureeqi	1	*	lol victims.  japan got exactly what it deserved.  
t1_durhydd	1	*	They sure love to show how they were victimized.  Teaching why such a horrible fate befell them is a different story.
t1_durhwff	1	*	China should respond by doing the same for the Nanking massacre
t1_durjvq7	0	*	Meh, these comments suck.

t1_durbd23	1	*	They should employ SFX to add the physical scars that the bomb caused.  That is a VERY important part of the story.  
t1_dut9fzm	1	*	Start shit get shit. They deserved it. 
t1_durlnho	0	*	now Korea and China should fund their story tellers to go abroad and spread war crimes committed by a certain Empire during WWII
t1_dure9gl	0	*	What about the rape of Nanking storytellers?
t1_durlhzc	1	*	Good stuff Japan! Now only if we could get you guys to admit to your own massacres and indiscretions.
t1_duslnpj	1	*	While they also try to suppress anything about the Rape of Nanking because that's inconvenient for their agenda and them trying to pose as a blameless victim. 
t1_dur9tr2	1	*	 The Chinese should do the same thing concerning the Rape of Nanking!
t1_dusg3ed	1	*	If you are against the bombings, spend a few minutes to [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIBbcxseXM) and you might have a new perspective and understand what happened better.
t1_durismu	1	*	Looks like someone has decided to press charges after all. 
t1_durgehq	1	*	Good. I visited the memorial museum in Hiroshima this summer, and the more knowledge of how truly horrible nuclear weapons are, the better.
t1_dureppz	1	*	Forgetting what went before will end up as deadly as the original deed. This is a worthwhile investment. 
t1_dus1mb1	1	*	Pretty straight forward. Big bombs, lots of deaths, radiation, fucked up shit. 
t1_dus3b1t	1	*	It's a cool idea I suppose, but isn't this what books and archived data are for? If they rely on people to pass stories on what happens if something happens to one of them? The story dies with them?
t1_durfsfq	1	*	talk shit, get hit
t1_durayxd	1	*	Great but no direct point of contact or did I miss that part?
t1_dure5xa	1	*	I heard one of these when I lived in Osaka. They're not as anti UK/us as you might think. But still a very humbling experience. 
t1_durfnd7	0	*	Odd how they don't fund travel costs for comfort women, or victims of unit 731, to come tell their stories.
t1_durk292	1	*	Ahh I wonder when they will start paying to tell the story of their atrocities also
t1_durfqy5	1	*	I wonder if they'll also pay for some Chinese to share their stories of the Rape of Nanking.
t1_dura0pl	1	*	Yeah, lets not forget the death marches they killed our soldiers on.
t1_dty0byq	1	*	This is coming from a place that looking to make Atheism a capital offense. Why even fight Is-is if the middle east is still adding on Is-is values.
t1_dto5m9e	1	*	Not worth going to the website. You get through 1-2 paragraphs and then a pop up shows up.
t1_dtx3hbq	1	*	Excellent news,  but not enough. Sadly
t1_dsivk8p	1	*	hes not there to pay respect. hes there to mock the victims for a dumb show your left cheek sheeps

t1_duz66jt	1	*	really people on Reddit have been saying Pakistan supports terrorism since they talk to the Taliban and recognize them as a group with power and support.

t1_dtbdi0u	0	*	When I was in Cancun it was mostly coke being sold.
t1_dtbhmdp	1	*	What about legalizing it country wide so it's not just American tourists bring shielded from drug violence?
t1_dtb09ib	1	*	Also to reduce low quality purchases. I bought an 8th from a vendor on a Cabo beach and that was 100% oregano.
t1_dtbfykf	1	*	Won't even make a dent. Cocaine and meth is the vast majority of product for the Cartels. Along with black tar heroin. 
t1_dtbiatv	1	*	Marijuana should be legalized ~~in two of Mexicos main tourist hot spots, Cancun and Los Cabos, in order to reduce violence, Mexicos minister of tourism said on Thursday.~~  FTFY.

t1_dtbfxnu	1	*	Someone needs to Sicario that shit. Benecio del toro is already packing.
t1_dtc18q5	1	*	marijuana should be legalized literally everywhere, not just where rich Americans go to party.

t1_du8jrko	1	*	You can take back ownership of your organs here:  https://www.donorregister.nl/gb_english
t1_du8y81d	1	*	Isn't this the case already in like 10-11 countries in EU? 
t1_du8qz6m	1	*	Lol.  It took an act of Congress to change a default setting...sounds about right...

t1_du8l4xu	0	*	This is scary as f$ck. Government mandated organ harvesting!!
t1_du8gppo	0	*	Why is this controversial? Before, everyone has a choice. Now, everyone has a choice. It really doesn't matter what the default is -- if you care strongly one way or the other then you can switch.
t1_dx2nu6n	1	*	I am so happy about this. 
t1_du8mnvz	1	*	I have American friends that think organ donation is a conspiracy by the super rich for them to harvest our organs so they can live several life spans.
t1_du8py9s	1	*	It's totally logical but there are always people who aren't. 
t1_du8ccix	0	*	I only wish I could give some conditions over who gets my organs. I'd rather give my lungs to someone who needs them but didn't smoke them away
t1_du8s6km	1	*	Now we wait for the story of someone dying on there way to opt out
t1_du8mln0	1	*	Reduce, reuse, recycle.
t1_du8grj0	1	*	Should be this way everywhere; and if you decline then you go to the end of the line if need an organ. It's only fair. 
t1_du8p8a1	0	*	I don't understand why anyone wouldnt be? I mean the only time that matters I'm fucking dead so U0001f937ufe0f I can 100% promise after I'm dead I no longer give a fuck about what happens to my body. 
t1_du8l82r	1	*	As long as it is for transplantation only, no problem.  
t1_du8pu7n	1	*	I still don't know why you wouldn't be a donor. It's not like you can use the organs anymore once you're dead. Just selfish really.
t1_du8rqo5	1	*	This needs to happen in the UK asap. 
t1_du8n4jr	0	*	Good thing there's an opt out. I wouldn't want to get to Aaru without my heart. Otherwise what's the fuck is Anubis gonna weigh? 
t1_du8hntt	0	*	I would opt out. Get out of my body. 
t1_du8j9yx	0	*	I would go and opt out on general principal...

t1_du90lob	0	*	I thought donating was supposed to be voluntary. 
t1_du8igza	1	*	This is also the case in Wales.
t1_du8imhs	1	*	This won't end well.
t1_du8hx0s	1	*	All your organ are now belong to us
t1_du8r546	1	*	This is how it should be done!
t1_du8dvqn	1	*	We've had this in Wales for a couple of years, saved quite a few lives I think.
t1_du8iove	1	*	We are just assets of the government to be used however they choose I guess.
t1_du8ep4r	0	*	We have this in Austria for as long as I can think back. It should be like this everywhere, honestly, those that care can opt out, those that dont help everyone else.
t1_du950h2	1	*	Good. 
t1_du8ieun	1	*	Don't worry my organs are gonna be trashed by the time I turn old. Looking to take em for a BIG SPIN
t1_du905vx	0	*	This isnt really freedom   Being free to opt in would be 
t1_du8kibb	1	*	Fascism at its finest. The government owns your land, water, and industry, now they own your organs. 
t1_du8grfa	1	*	Due process, much? Awesome idea though.
t1_du8jwic	1	*	We've had it in Poland for years, although it's a common practise for doctors to ask the families if they agree to give away their loved ones' organs
t1_du8gemq	1	*	When i die i dont want my organs to be harvested,and i dont want to be buried
t1_du90pne	0	*	I don't know why you wouldn't want to donate your organs. That being said, completely against being forced to do things. Guess that's my American showing. 
t1_dw72n9c	1	*	TAKe my heart my soul my monkey
t1_du8hlj9	1	*	Would be very frightening if they did something like that in the U.S.
t1_du8fcx9	0	*	If you wont give an organ you dont get an organ. Problem solved.
t1_du8kwtw	1	*	Poland has it, yet surgeons still chicken out and ask family for permission.   2005:   http://www.poltransplant.org.pl/ow.html  http://www.poltransplant.org.pl/ust_transpl.html
t1_du8g40e	0	*	This is to be a donnor after you die?
t1_du8s9g6	1	*	Great policy from The Netherlands imo. The more organ donations the better, those who don't want it can opt out anyway. Just have to make sure this change is communicated effectively to the citizens.
t1_du8fdxo	1	*	So the choice went from Do I want to be a decent person to Do I want to be an asshole
t1_du8i9km	1	*	You will let us kill you and profit off your organs, damn it.
t1_du8fdui	0	*	Meanwhile, paremedics the country over preathe a sigh of relief. It's okay, boys, ease off the gas, this man's an ORGAN DONOR!!
t1_du8prt8	1	*	i feel bad for the poor bastard that gets my organs 
t1_du9l0kl	1	*	It's prob because the population is going to decline
t1_du8r9sg	1	*	Or, you know, focus on development of stem cells or other technologies instead of forcing organ donation. 
t1_du8orp7	1	*	I'm opted in because the US government doesn't assume ownership over my organs.
t1_du8j1z6	1	*	Ultimate recycling program!!!
t1_du8fxwo	1	*	Just make the organ donation and receiving system the same. Out or in, choose. If you want to be able to receive one you have to be willing to donate yourself.
t1_du8s8t5	0	*	Screw that nonsense. Legally taking organs from people they don't like so they can save people they do like? That's fucked. 
t1_du8qcaa	1	*	This has been law in Wales for a few years now, happy to see it expanded elsewhere
t1_du9uvys	1	*	Been saying this for years!
t1_du8k4a4	1	*	That makes me SERIOUSLY uncomfortable. 
t1_du8f1tf	1	*	I think instead of carrying a donor card people should be required to carry a non-donor card.  we can call it the Cancel Utilizing New Tissue card.
t1_du8zv0m	1	*	this is the right way to do it.
t1_dua2my7	1	*	I still don't understand why we (Germany) do not have this.
t1_du8xeup	1	*	I really like this idea. Ive always said you dont need your organs if youre dead. Its honestly really selfish to oppose organ donation.
t1_du8fjan	1	*	> New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor.  The whole headline would be better without this part.
t1_du8oe6x	1	*	This would mean I dont have to carry this stupid organ donar card with me anymore. 
t1_du90hb3	0	*	But ... I need my kidneys
t1_du8i2jt	1	*	17.02 million is an amazing achievement , the more plenty available now the more people live

t1_dt2hj6y	1	*	fine.  Well, if he wants to get some more practice in apologizing, he could apologize for proclaiming that Junipero Serra is a Saint.   
t1_dt3v7t5	1	*	The Pope is very media savy. He says something completely different depending on where he is or which press he is speaking with. Forked tongue 
t1_du0jhfh	0	*	Why is this illegal?
t1_du0gpxs	1	*	I would be tempted to do the same. I wonder how well that supercomputer can hash though

t1_dtp61f2	0	*	really hope this doesn't mean only the US governments but all. most importantly china

t1_dtp0itg	1	*	Except videos funded by Russian govt. I guess ;)
t1_dtp36fo	1	*	Maybe people will start to realize all these war glory movies are just propaganda.
t1_dtp5zjb	1	*	So if I make my employee Jack, post a video, it's no longer funded by me? 
t1_dtp535v	1	*	Hilarious coming from a company that profits off of other peoples work.  
t1_dtpdgbq	1	*	Will they include videos that are funded by non-US governments?  Or by corporations?  
t1_dtp6zab	1	*	RIP Coldmirror.
t1_dtp6tfz	1	*	I would like to see who funds different videos all together. It would be nice to see what companies are pro blue and red. 
t1_dtp3i54	1	*	I wonder if the channels I work for will recieve this, because we are in part funded with a grant through PBS.
t1_dtpedsu	1	*	wait... my coerced income goes towards youtube videos? c'mon people... can you stop voting for the two major parties? this is getting fucking ridiculous.
t1_dtpgctm	1	*	Then we  get concerned when the Paul brothers are getting labelled.

t1_dtp40dq	1	*	How will this affect all the Baba Booey videos I watch?
t1_dtp3d07	1	*	First step of censorship is to build the infrastructure to identify those you want censored. This is that step packaged in a way people can get behind 
t1_dtppn0n	1	*	This is an ultra bad idea, but I guess the aim is to placate the complainers only, which it might be enough to do.
t1_dtp7ao5	1	*	People are saying  some will get around it but its still a good idea and better than nothing
t1_dtpbdtg	1	*	https://m.imgur.com/gallery/bEcID
t1_dtp6b4c	1	*	Not only that, but not having the disclaimer becomes an endorsement that there is *not* government funding.

t1_dtp3y79	1	*	What if the government funding it is Russias?
t1_dtp5mh0	1	*	I wonder how this will affect the trending tab on YouTube. 
t1_dtp6669	1	*	Uh huh, and when will videos that receive corporate funding disclose which corporations they are being funded by?
t1_dtp7xrw	0	*	This is great. PBS and NPR need to make a decision if they believe their government funding is just a small percentage like they keep telling us during their insane fundraising drives.
t1_dtprpj9	1	*	Would be so easy to label a thing good or bad?
t1_dtoxam2	0	*	Sponsored by UK (BBC), China (CCTV), Russian (RT), News Corp. (name some outlets).... even some vloggers got sponsored.

t1_dtpeow6	1	*	i'm sorry for asking this but what does this ultimately do or affect?
t1_dtp561t	1	*	Please YouTube, put this into the mobile app and site too! Often, details like this miss the mobile 
t1_dtp7kbt	1	*	Ignorant on the subject here. What types of videos are receiving govt funding?
t1_dtp3lg8	1	*	I recall looking through my old comic books and noticing that the GI Joe ones had no ads. 
t1_dtpwten	0	*	Much more important: YouTube should start labeling videos that receive funding from ideological organisations and commercial organisations. These spread even more dangerous information. 
t1_dtpt9tg	1	*	Has anyone actually read that entire article? Someone tell me it's going to be OK.
t1_dtp9twr	1	*	it's not like they will be labeling ALL government funded videos, so no need to get excited...

t1_dsgyv4i	1	*	The Canadian Revolution has begun. 
t1_dsh4w38	1	*	To be clear, a few franchisees have done this. Not Tim Hortons as a whole. 
t1_dsh02o2	1	*	More donuts for me :D. 
t1_dsh8cxh	1	*	A Tim Hortons recently appeared in Manchester UK, didn't realise it was a massive franchise.  Was going to give it a try but the recent debacle has soured the taste somewhat
t1_dsgycn0	1	*	I started seeing Tims going downhill not much longer after they sold to Burger King...
t1_dsgxguv	1	*	Canadian here, first I've heard of it. 
t1_dshj2wp	1	*	Their apology campaign after rolling back these changes should be Horton's hears a you
t1_dsh9bkc	1	*	My hometown in Minnesota is getting a Tim Hortons. I was very excited but now the Canadians are really upset. I am awash in conflict 
t1_dsgzzje	0	*	Look, I get it TH is a cultural institution, but can we just be honest with each other - their coffee **sucks**. 
t1_dsh0lqr	1	*	Bout time that place fell off its high horse. Their coffee is fuckin rotten 
t1_dshmo1g	1	*	Boycott? I'd never go there in the first place their food and coffee is shit. I can spend $300 and end up making better coffee and saving money yearly than going to that shit hole.
t1_dshe4wd	1	*	Mad as Heck*
t1_dsgxt5r	1	*	We are mad ?  First time I heard of it ... maybe in Ontario.
t1_dshll2k	1	*	TIL I'm not supposed to like Tims anymore. I'm Canadian and this is the first time I've heard they're falling out of favor, albeit I don't drink Coffee so I'm only in it for the donuts.
t1_dsh19st	0	*	I dont live in Ontario any more, but if legislation is going to pass for $15 minimum wage, this is a direct result... fundamentally cant have it both ways. 
t1_dsh4xk4	1	*	Sorry - Tim Hortons Not this time - Canadians
t1_dsh8205	1	*	Perhaps Tim's should complain first to their owners at *3G Capital* about profits rather than their employees.
t1_dshcen8	1	*	Paid breaks? I never realized that other franchise owners offered paid breaks. When I worked for Tim Hortons that was not an option for storefront staff, only supervisors/managers.
t1_dshar4r	1	*	They'll picket, but will they accept higher prices for that cup of coffee? Nope. Just get your coffee somewhere else and call it a day folks. 
t1_dshhq68	1	*	So many ppl in here that care way too much about what coffee people should be drinking. 
t1_dsh5m7k	1	*	Canadians - boycotting and picketing, like civil humans.  There'd be riots and violence here if McDonald's workers lost their breaks.
t1_dsh0qhk	1	*	I am mad as hell at Kathleen Wynne and her economically illiterate government
t1_dsh0afq	1	*	Meanwhile in America companies do that kinda stuff all the time and no one bats an eye... sad.

t1_dsgyot8	1	*	One thing I'd like to point out to those saying how great mcDonalds is, I never got paid breaks.
t1_dsgv2kj	1	*	Canadians would do well to skip the timmies drive thru line and drink coffee instead. 
t1_dsgyzeq	1	*	People still go to Tim Hortons? Terrible coffee and Terrible donuts. Used to be great
t1_dshbsa1	1	*	We all know Tim Hortons is absolute garbage
t1_dsh448q	1	*	This comment and others similar to it pop up every time this Tim Hortons thing is mentioned.
t1_dsh5x08	1	*	I was entitled to paid breaks and benefits?

t1_dsq3d8i	1	*	Is it me or has every alleged hate crime in the media last year turned out to be fake?
t1_dsqc5rv	0	*	I have empathy for the family. The girl probably fell and ripped her hijab, was afraid she'd get in trouble and told a lie that garnered international attention. 
t1_dsr9ifa	0	*	Where's the guy who commented on the last article with the links to all the other hoaxes :)? 
t1_dsq4e8g	1	*	Why did she make it up!? Has the girl or her family responded? Im so confused.   This unfortunately is going to harm other genuine people who are victims of a hate crime.
t1_dsrmhhr	1	*	So who made the hoax? Was it the girl? Police? Wtf! 
t1_dsq9zre	1	*	JOURNALISM IS DEAD.  So many retractions and fake stories. Its getting really aggravating.

t1_dsqb0uo	1	*	Yeah I had some speculation that this seemed odd when I read the article.

t1_dspwmlv	0	*	There are a lot of fake hate crimes that dont get much attention once discovered to be fake. There's probably a sub for it.

t1_dspze74	1	*	lmao people in that last thread were 100% right
t1_dsqe352	1	*	So, will the liar be punished?  The article didn't even mention that filing a false police report is a crime.  Of course, a 10-year old can't be punished for telling a lie, but who put her up to it?
t1_dsq2g9d	1	*	I knew it, story was smelling like bullshit from miles away.
t1_dsq579q	1	*	Hate crimes carry heavy sentences.  Hate crime hoaxes should be dealt with accordingly.   
t1_dsqxl0w	1	*	Fake news is getting out of control.

t1_dsq2z6n	0	*	surely there must be some kind of law to shut down these news agencies for inciting hysteria and what basically amounts to a race war.
t1_dspyn1v	1	*	You know, when I first heard this story [I had my doubts](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7pxgt8/police_investigating_report_that_man_assaulted/dsksdjq/)...
t1_dsq0x59	1	*	addd it to a longgggg list
t1_dsqp5oy	1	*	They were so desperate to shove another example of muh islamaphobia in the publics' face that they published a fake story of an attack on a Muslim woman.

t1_dsq528y	1	*	Funniest part about being called a racist for calling this story a hoax is that Islam isn't even a race.
t1_dsq0byz	1	*	But at least it started a discussion!
t1_dsqc4im	1	*	There is too much $$$ in Breaking News for this to change anytime soon.  
t1_dsqijmp	1	*	Did the girl confess to the police it didn't happen or is it that the police couldn't find any evidence of it happening?
t1_dsqu0xk	1	*	These racial attacks always seem to be faked/hoaxes biggest problem is that the news hasn't been responsible enough to retract or if they do it gets 1/10th of the attention the actual story does.
t1_dsqfi3z	1	*	Not that surprised. The girl didn't seem shaken at all during the press conference. The mother did an exceptional job with her acting though. She did look very much in grief.
t1_dsqg8ls	1	*	This pisses me off so much. I have a Muslim friend who this actually happened to and this makes people less likely to believe her story. 
t1_dsqaqtn	0	*	This kid is never going to live this down. 
t1_dspycya	0	*	Young girl making up shit for attention.... welcome to 1st world problems.

t1_dt1dz5b	1	*	As a European, this is like watching 2 hypocrites tell the other they are being a hypocrite, while the evil Russian is watching from the sidelines knowing neither can possibly throw shade at him.
t1_dt1akdy	1	*	Remember this is coming from a communist country U0001f914
t1_dt1cfay	1	*	Its more of a problem with the republic in republic democracy, when the people in charge suck theres relatively little the people can do about it
t1_dt1d77c	1	*	Communist countries always have a great understanding of democracy
t1_dt1d6i7	1	*	I feel like we've had a shutdown at least a handful of times in the past decade and a half. 
t1_dt1a2kt	0	*	It shut down twice with Obama. 
t1_dt1ass5	1	*	How dare we force our government to put forth a budget to avoid financial crisis instead of manipulating our currency! 
t1_dt1anwk	1	*	He went on to say, Chinese citizens who don't agree will be tortured and killed. 
t1_dt19mfe	1	*	China really knows something about democracy huh 
t1_dt1cn9v	1	*	Of course they would say that. 
t1_dt1b3zc	1	*	And we care what they say about a representative republic why?
t1_dt1bnyj	1	*	Fucking commies..

t1_dt1cgmn	1	*	At least our student protests don't result in 10000 people turned into pie
t1_dt1i6oh	1	*	ITT: Americans bring up things that happened in China 30+ years ago to defend what is happening in America today. 
t1_dt1agh4	1	*	Well this thread turned into roast China pretty damn fast. 
t1_dt193fc	1	*	Hey, quick question.  Who thinks 50 million people is a lot of people?
t1_dt1qcjz	1	*	Their intentions, agenda, and current worse state of affairs notwithstanding, I'm not inclined to disagree with the statement on its face.
t1_dt1kk4v	1	*	and?
t1_dt1byl3	1	*	Democracy chaotic and chronically flawed.  Communism though, run people over with tanks, no big deal.
t1_dt1guo1	1	*	Says the country that runs its people over with tanks. 
t1_dt1njtf	1	*	Well, hes not wrong...
t1_dt1nxq0	1	*	China doesnt even have real internet and think the transformer movies are good.
t1_dt1j1sv	1	*	When Obama was in office the government shutdown all the time. Its normal 
t1_dt1cdf2	1	*	China says a lot of things.  Most of it untrue propaganda.
t1_dt0zsbm	1	*	Trying to chip away at the foundation 
t1_dt103us	1	*	I didnt need to hear that from China to know its true. Next thing they gonna tell the isnt flat. Thanks country obvious.
t1_dt1ikwe	1	*	Well, yeah.  They're not wrong.
t1_dt21lut	0	*	Hasnt this happened before though?   Im European so my knowledge of American politics is weak at best.
t1_dt1cyp7	1	*	You know even in such decisive times it is good to know both democrats and republicans can come together and defend our country when another one insults it.
t1_dt1amqo	1	*	Democracy is the worst form of government. Except for all the other ones.

t1_dt18zgi	1	*	At least we don't have to deal with fascist social credit score system here. 
t1_dt1bjmp	1	*	Why are we upvoting these delusions? It's laughable that this is the only thing they can use to prove their cause is the right one.
t1_dt1ccai	1	*	the current daca is league's better than China's immigration policy and yet we are shut down because of it not being funded properly?
t1_dt1f7s4	1	*	China should check their human rights records before they call out our democratic process. 
t1_dt2foua	1	*	Whatever, still doesnt make envy China in the slightest.
t1_dt1ovtl	1	*	Not only does this site try to spam your browser to death but the posters name is just  the worst. China thinks we suck, got it.
t1_dt1plnm	1	*	you think?
t1_dt1olj5	1	*	The U.S. is not a democracy, It's a constitutional representative republic. If it is a democracy, then when is the last time you as a citizen voted on a law?
t1_dt1h2md	1	*	Well, on the one hand - there not wrong. On the other hand, it's still better than many alternatives! 
t1_dt22h1s	1	*	yes, yes it is.  what's your point, china?
t1_dt1ar8u	1	*	Don't they keep track of 'society points', or something like that now?
t1_dt1apg2	1	*	Say what you will, at least they arent murdering dissidents and meditation practitioners.
t1_dt1d3wo	1	*	Hilariously enough its not a democracy at all. We elect people who don't represent the interests of those who voted for them whatsoever. 
t1_dt1en0k	1	*	To be fair, they're not *wrong.* They're just an asshole.
t1_dt1f8ps	0	*	Funny, they seem to have the whole internet shut down 24/7 in China. 
t1_dt23857	1	*	we say the west is the only place where the individual is sovereign
t1_dt1m1j0	1	*	I have to say I agree.

t1_dt1doq3	1	*	from China              thats the joke ppl
t1_dt1g8yy	1	*	China would be right.
t1_dt1q9si	1	*	Who the fuck cares what China thinks of democracy? Why is this news?
t1_dt1ok02	1	*	Yeah, try our communism where there are no choices. Much better.
t1_dt19v5o	1	*	Chaos is a ladder, and China try'na climb.
t1_dt1cyqc	1	*	They aint wrong, but their government aint right either
t1_dt1apxs	1	*	Thats funny 
t1_dt1khqk	1	*	Right Right... because the Chinese government is so perfectly balanced and honest it doesn't have currency manipulation, corruption or building islands to claim international waters.
t1_dt1a6qz	1	*	China can stfu even if other people have problems. What is this, McBeth?
t1_dt1bv0o	1	*	Yeah china, thats democracy. Sometimes things go wild, and chaotic. Better than a regime that leaves you no choice.
t1_dt1e0f1	1	*	At least we don't wafflestop our people with tanks.
t1_dt1akf4	1	*	*THAT'S THE POINT*  seriously though, the guys that wrote the constitution intended for this
t1_dt1luyx	1	*	It was 95% of the democrats that voted for the shutdown.
t1_dt1bf3e	1	*	Thanks China, we got the memo over a year ago. 
t1_dt1r623	1	*	Gosh, I wonder if he realized how much shit hes talking about his own country.  Id much rather live in a Democracy than whatever China is.
t1_dt19x7s	1	*	China's just spitting facts at this point lmao.
t1_dt1mbce	1	*	Unfortunately they may be right. People keep talking about 'peak capitalism' but it just might be peak Democracy.
t1_dt1azop	1	*	Its a democracy with no central power. No ones single person is at the wheel so Im just surprised things work at all. 
t1_dt17k3d	1	*	The US is not a democracy, it's an oligarchy.
t1_dt1h4zt	1	*	>shutdown shows U.S. democracy chaotic and chronically flawed  In other news, the sky is blue 
t1_dt1ejbo	1	*	I would say upwards of 10,454 dead Chinese citizens killed by their own government in 1989 would have a different opinion on what is chaotic and chronically flawed.
t1_dt1na3z	1	*	No, it just shows how corrupt the government is. Playing hostage games with programs that affect real people in real ways.
t1_dt1eoqx	1	*	shut up and give me my iphone
t1_dt1moq7	1	*	Good thing we arent a democracy in the USA 
t1_dt1lvn6	1	*	Well, they're not exactly wrong...
t1_dt1eaox	1	*	Tell us something we don't already know, China. 
t1_dt1pwvl	1	*	Go live in China. I dare you.  People die attempting to escape in shipping containers. You have no liberty, you cannot even move to different cities without permits. 
t1_dt26guq	1	*	alot of butthurt people here, just realise that democracy is just another form of survival of the fitest. In this case it's survival of whomever plays the dirtiest game.
t1_dt1kxlt	1	*	There are a lot of other far better examples of a democratic government than the US.
t1_dt1g0vy	1	*	Who is this China person? 
t1_dt1wskw	1	*	Careful China, dont give your population too many ideas about government shutdowns as a means to enact change.
t1_dt1ft2x	1	*	Most people in this thread behave like 6 year olds who scream but he's worse!!! when confronted with valid criticism.
t1_dt1lni0	1	*	People can often be judged over the quality of their friends...  Hmm.. North Korea vs Canada.
t1_dt19ygv	1	*	They might have a point there, but I'd rather live somewhere where I'm free to say that about my system without being jailed or killed.
t1_dt1sxwo	1	*	About the response I expected.
t1_dt1hyzr	1	*	I think China's message is pretty clear:    See Donald? We told you dictatorship much easier. Much better. Very good, very good. .
t1_dt1bpda	1	*	Right at least we haven't killed the most people in human history
t1_dt3a5qw	1	*	So was the Soviet Union.
t1_dt1k2iu	1	*	you know you fucking up when China is talking shit
t1_dt1gs93	1	*	Well, its run by humans, so...  show us something created by humans that is perfect? Bedsides the glorious blah blah of China. 
t1_dt1aosg	1	*	So we should adopt the mao starvation model of the 50s, got jt
t1_dt1g1p6	1	*	Ahahah China talking about a government being chronically flawed. Yes big brother
t1_dt1nw6q	1	*	Hahaha Trump and the Republicans have literally just un-won the Cold War. Way to go, assholes!
t1_dt1c3zp	1	*	Juuuuust in case the trump administration hadn't already made that obvious
t1_dt1kn5b	1	*	I dont remember people freaking out when the government shutdown during Obamas presidency..?
t1_dt22ekn	1	*	Sound like CHINA needs some more freedom.
t1_dt1d23q	0	*	They aren't wrong. China's system isn't any better or less corrupt, but they aren't wrong about the United States version of democracy being chronically flawed.
t1_dt1ew8r	0	*	Yeah I'd still prefer the US to China. You have to admit though, that great firewall is a technological marvel. Their clamp on their citizens internet access is a marvel of civil engineering. 
t1_dt1bjod	1	*	Chronically flawed, kind of like the fact that the Chinese government doesn't operate under rule of law, and never has?
t1_dt1ej63	1	*	Democratic Republics > Totalitarianism. Do not let Donnie take away from the fact that indirect representation is a better form of government that no representation at all.
t1_dt1c50n	0	*	So it's only a problem when trump is in office?  I remember the same thing happening in 2013...
t1_dt1kls0	1	*	Say what you will about 1984, that goverment was hella orderly.
t1_dt1p011	1	*	This was strategically posted by a foreign government in a most likely successful effort in molding your thoughts.    I suggest you research the facts yourself, or not, and be the good sheep you are.
t1_dt1ax8g	1	*	they arent wrong.   but that doesn't make their system any more valid.    I might be stupid but that doesn't make you any less ugly.
t1_dt19zdr	1	*	Well yeah, but that's got nothing to do with its flaws, it has to do with the ineptitude of this administration 
t1_dt1lmmo	1	*	You know something is wrong when China says we are a poor democracy!
t1_dt1p0r6	1	*	At least we're not China!
t1_dt1ldmp	1	*	China also says the world belongs to China, and China is the most handsomest, popular and smartest kid at school.
t1_dt2wl08	1	*	lolololol there is so much whataboutism in this thread it is comical. So it's only whataboutism, if China is criticized right? Gotcha. 
t1_dt1m6qg	1	*	Nice job upvoting Chinese government propaganda to the top, reddit.
t1_dt1ck19	1	*	Says a bunch of communists. 
t1_dt1azpe	1	*	Well, they're not wrong. But I don't think they're ones to talk.
t1_dt1dq3d	1	*	Well can't say they're not wrong
t1_dt1ghjs	1	*	Don't even talk to me till you have movie stars and reality TV personalities running you country.  
t1_dt1avir	1	*	[The story Newsweek caged from.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/21/us-shutdown-exposes-chaotic-political-system-chinas-news-agency-says)

t1_dt1o4ph	1	*	I very much dislike the current administration but I'll take flawed democracy over communism any day.
t1_dt21f2g	0	*	Tienanmen Square, and the death of 10's of thousands of protesters under the tracks of tanks, does not speak highly of China's method of government.  So STFU, China.
t1_dt1kjjj	1	*	Isn't it strange, the notion that an entire nation says something or does something?  I feel like it's a really stupid perspective to perpetuate 
t1_dt1n5sk	1	*	People act like a Government shutdown has never happened before Trump......
t1_dt1zxe2	1	*	A government shutdown in China would look a lot different.
t1_dt1izbw	1	*	i mean, they're not wrong...
t1_dt1o75o	1	*	Government is shut down...all is well.
t1_dt1l7ee	1	*	Communists lecturing us on democracy? 
t1_dt1eyj7	1	*	Sounds like something the north koreans would say as well.
t1_dt13p3o	1	*	Here come the Americans.  
t1_dt1buxi	1	*	It shows the strength and resilience of freedom. 5000 years of tyranny doesnt teach the Chinese peoples a thing! 
t1_dt1buxj	1	*	Wow. China has a great PR team everyone in the world admires China and is not at all afraid of them. What a perfect place, not only do they have walls they have the greatest. 
t1_dt1bsr2	1	*	At least our congress doesn't break out in fights.
t1_dt1dvm5	1	*	This is coming from fucking China though. Not saying they're wrong,but pot kettle.
t1_dt1jau7	1	*	There is something ironic about a country with such abysmal civil liberties criticizing a country whose shutdown just means furloughing lower level, nonessential gov't employees.
t1_dt1d07t	1	*	Well let's be honest. They're not exactly wrong are they?
t1_dt1asbt	1	*	Funny that they say anything when everyone knows the shutdown is just meaningless partisan politics done every so often by both parties.
t1_dt1cecv	1	*	What have they said during the last 10+ shutdowns?
t1_dt1gfbj	1	*	RELEASE THE MEMO
t1_dt1fmkx	1	*	We're shutting down the government... The only way i keep the government open is if you find and bring me some Cambodian breast milk...
t1_dt1ddup	1	*	Term limits for congress, anyone? Anyone? 
t1_dt1opz4	1	*	China only cares about itself until it finds the opportunity to stir the pot somewhere else.
t1_dt1lsbp	1	*	Good fucking luck saying that about China. The US is amazing compared to their dictatorship.
t1_dt1j7zs	1	*	Seriously, if China has such problems with democracy, why do they bear the fruits of democracy and capitalism.  It's like, you know, double-standard?
t1_dt1ih1m	1	*	[the actual comment written by Chinese government](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/21/c_136912263.htm)

t1_dt1p91k	1	*	Yes, the communist-style gun-to-the-head style of politics sure creates unity.
t1_dt1jlcu	1	*	The Greeks figured out that Democracy sucks. The anti-liberty Chinese can suck my dick tho.
t1_dt1ibat	1	*	Can say I'd argue.  The fact they were working on a 1-2 week deal to work on a longer deal is asinine.  None of this was a surprise.
t1_dt1glka	1	*	A communist country commenting on a democratic republic is hilarious. 
t1_dt1enu1	1	*	Wow, the butt hurt Americans in denial.. 
t1_dt0ypt1	1	*	Just look at the street, the road and people in China then you know what chao really is.

t1_dt1nlfi	1	*	Did China just  whatabout the US?
t1_dt1fc7w	1	*	A little chaos is a good thing 
t1_dt1ke9c	1	*	That was awesome. Thank you.
t1_dt1fgvt	1	*	See, this is why democracy is bad and we need powerful leaders who can be in control of everything -Russia, China  Do you not see why the want to interfere in our elections? 
t1_dt1klqy	1	*	I'll take critiques about our democracy from a lot of people, but not the Chinese gov.

t1_dt1qsfv	1	*	America says that too.
t1_dt1gskq	1	*	These shutdowns are a feature, not a bug. Democratic government requires compromise. 
t1_dt47d4i	1	*	Why can't Americans admit when China says something correct? Why is it always 'China did X Y Z!'? That's not the topic here. There are plenty of other threads condemning China.
t1_dt1j3no	1	*	Funny, we say the same thing about the Great Leap Forward.
t1_dt1epzs	1	*	And I say, Duh, China.

t1_dt08kth	1	*	I don't know why but scene from Red film comes to my mind. He used such soft hand cuffs and did great job at covering shit :) 
t1_dszugny	0	*	Sounds awfully convenient to have your wife called Honey. Even when you have an argument with her it sounds like youre still calling her by her love name.
t1_dszyok7	1	*	Good ass praxis.
t1_dt04k47	1	*	I wonder if we'll ever find out who did it. Or if the killers are even in Canada at this point. They're probably in Russia somewhere.
t1_dszutr5	1	*	I would look for the family member that has the best alibi.  Because no way someone would stay home alone on the night their hitman is going to make the killings.  
t1_dszw29q	0	*	Wow . This sort of thing isnt supposed to happen in Canada . I thought we were a peaceful nation . 
t1_dszwol5	1	*	This is an unbelievably inaccurate and misleading title.  I mean it's next-level stupid.

t1_dszxlxv	1	*	Does anyone know if the book he wrote is still coming out?
t1_dszwc6v	1	*	Just read another article that says the bodies were found in a semi sitting position. If one were to hang them self they would not sit down but hang, like from the ceiling.
t1_dszyshf	1	*	My theory is that the huge donation to the CAMH came from their death.
t1_dt056f9	1	*	i wonder who put the hit out on him and why... but we will honestly probably never find out.
t1_dt07kaw	1	*	This is the shit that only happens in movies. It pisses me of that someone can hust hire a hitmen and engage in politics or big businesses like that. Someone talks just take him out

t1_dsztxqk	0	*	The question is, who fucking cares?
t1_dt1otio	0	*	They were not executed.  They were not arrested, tried, convicted and killed by a government.  They were, possibly, murdered.
t1_dt0082i	1	*	Honestly I'm surprised we don't hear about corporate motivated murder more often. They'll do anything to protect profits, and they're proud of it.

t1_dt08u7h	1	*	I honestly wonder if one of their kids were behind it.

t1_dszw8li	1	*	Hollywood-quality crime.
t1_dt00u0s	1	*	To be clear, news of the two deaths are a month old and few doubted at the time that it was murder; the only new development since then is that the police are now officially calling it murder.
t1_dszuzkc	1	*	This is crazy!
t1_dt084xf	1	*	I believe the word is 'murdered'.

t1_dszxfuz	1	*	Interesting 
t1_dt00nk0	1	*	Is executed the proper diction to use here? I was always under the impression that the murder of a public figure was considered assassination, regardless of whether the murderer was hired or not.
t1_dszyjnj	1	*	Billionaire excuted is a headline by itself. The rest is just so much extra icing on this awful cake
t1_dt0gelg	1	*	Lol.  Im just saying, they are professional, youre a reddit troll

t1_dszwnd5	0	*	Werent they in the paradise papers?
t1_dt01njc	1	*	So y'all still dont wanna carry glocks?
t1_dszxctf	0	*	Two things to say about this:  1) the cops might've done it.  2) I never expected people in Canada would start executing rich people before the angry mobs of poor people in the US did.  Huh.

t1_duiams6	1	*	Yeah right, good luck with that mission. Corruption has tainted the core of the government. Now its so rotten, the only thing to do is to throw it all away and produce a new seed.
t1_dui8gro	0	*	So why doesnt he set the example and pay more than is required of him. Im sure the government wouldnt object. 
t1_dui9rm8	1	*	I wouldn't trust any more taxes to our government. There has to be a better way.

t1_dui98e7	1	*	They should also be prevented from abusive business practices.
t1_dui8bu8	1	*	The broadest shoulders carry the heaviest burden. Haha j/k, all the richers care about is showing off their sweet shoulders to us little weaklings. 
t1_dui88b3	1	*	Cool story, bro  - Trump
t1_duia2wv	1	*	Do you want billionaires to leave your country? Because that's how you get billionaires to leave your country. 
t1_duiat70	1	*	I hope I see something big in my life time
t1_duiarzq	1	*	Then do it,  there's nothing stopping you. 
t1_duibbc6	1	*	No one is stopping him from writing a check to the government of his choice..

t1_dui7qmt	1	*	I appreciate that Gates is on the right side of this, but I'm just gonna quickly take a small dose of Vitamin Duh . . . DUH!
t1_duiamu2	1	*	And we want billionaires influencing politics when we agree with them right?
t1_dui7z1g	1	*	Doesnt matter who pays what until we make sure its going to the right places. Even if we did this Republicans would still take money from teachers and give it to the military. 
t1_duiamfo	0	*	What's he waiting for?  He could literally pay as much tax as he wants right now, why isn't he?
t1_dui7owo	1	*	Then get TheFairTax Act passed and billionaires will pay significantly more taxes
t1_dui7o68	1	*	Yes. Yes they should. 
t1_dui9wfn	1	*	Not that they should pay more, percentage wise, they should actually just pay the dang taxes.
t1_duia85h	1	*	Need to close so many loopoles or it wont matter what the top 1% are taxed at. Same for corporations. I wish I had answers, but politicians are part of the 1% so its already a conflict of interest.
t1_duiadf8	1	*	Appropriate companies that evade taxes!
t1_dui7pl2	1	*	They'll just move money overseas to avoid tax like they do now!!!
t1_dui6wzz	1	*	I'll take him more seriously when he starts up a lobby group to influence lawmakers to actually fix the system.
t1_dui8pum	1	*	Agreed. Pay mine.
t1_dui7gtq	1	*	It must be his lucky day, he can pay extra anytime he wants: https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/23779454
t1_dui79gr	1	*	And it keeps people like him at the top who are already there. And makesit harder for others to climb the ladder. 
t1_dui8drt	0	*	He's a fool ,  I can take over the government tomorrow and cut,  the tax rate everybody is paying by 40% and likely increase your benefits at the same time.

t1_duzbxpr	1	*	What is advanced infrastructure? Solar freakin' roadways?  From what the article seemed to be saying; they just built a normal train station very quickly.
t1_duz7rcq	1	*	Well I think there's some reason for this. The US is huge in relation to its population so a lot of the rural areas don't have the budget from having enough inhabitants to get large upgrades. 
t1_dv0vz2x	1	*	This isn't news it's an unsubstantiated and obviously hyperbolic claim from some random rich guy. 
t1_duze9qq	1	*	Of course it is, everything was shacks and diets roads 50 years ago. 
t1_duz6km4	1	*	china is beating america at its own capitalist game - president Trump is seeking to make it easier to build

t1_duf6hce	1	*	Oh the Facebook VP said it. Guess it's true then. 
t1_dufe7js	1	*	Don't we do the same to other countries?  What's new about this?
t1_dug7h7r	1	*	Show me on the teddy bear where Russia touched you 
t1_duhii6p	1	*	WOW ! Facebook's advertising is so amazing that russians spending $1.2 million  a month beat  out hillary , who spent $66 million a month !   Incredible . 
t1_dug5ic0	1	*	If you get swayed by Facebook comments your a fukin idiot
t1_duf6kwn	0	*	and itll keep working if everyone just plugs their ears and yells sexist or sjw at each other instead of engaging 
t1_duf1znf	1	*	To be fair, it's pretty hilarious the Russians spent fuck all money in the scheme of things and achieved the result they did.
t1_dufdlwf	1	*	Propaganda works. Who would have thought?  /s
t1_duf8rkw	1	*	Criminal negligence?
t1_duevd9l	0	*	We were already divided.
t1_dufavqb	1	*	Watch CNN or MSNBC for an hour. Pretty sure those type of outlets divide America WAAAAAY more
t1_duf7ysa	1	*	So do something about it?
t1_duf4izo	1	*	Jokes on him, America has always been pretty divided.
t1_duf9qu0	0	*	Why dont we just hack Russia? 
t1_duf5qt9	1	*	Eh America was a divided country long before Facebook existed. Long before the computer existed. 
t1_duf7r88	1	*	This was the plot to Captain America: Civil War
t1_duf8gz2	1	*	This shit is just rebranded, liberal led McCarythism 
t1_dsws3om	1	*	Zimbabwean Opposition Leader is the real story.   Mugabe's party is crumbling and desperate to remain in control.  oh sorry, Im not taking my meds. pay no attention to me. 
t1_dspjc1q	0	*	Aren't they both just black books?
t1_dsv0z0l	1	*	The article said they walked together under that flag in Turin 2006 when I saw it earlier at work, but now that line disappeared. 
t1_dsukhb0	1	*	maybe the flag will be of the dickbutt
t1_dstghkz	0	*	Maybe Trump's insanity pushed them together. This is positive news, but I wonder if the North will use it to show they really are the rightful leaders of the peninsula. 
t1_dsu6x0f	1	*	The question is: which flag is it?
t1_dsujxus	1	*	That flag better have a hentai girl on it or im going to boycott this bullshit
t1_dstswps	1	*	Jung un the voice of reason? Step up your game Trump
t1_dstpztf	1	*	Thank you President Trump.  And to think, not letting NK walk all over us was the quickest way to a solution.
t1_dsu3vfp	1	*	Sound is nice, hopefully without to happen a nuclear war this seperation will end...
t1_dstpk9s	1	*	Now kith
t1_dsukl4j	1	*	lmao every olympics they make this out to be a big deal but it doesn't mean jackshit.
t1_dsudy82	1	*	Damn.. Trump can really perform miracles
t1_dstp8pi	1	*	Doesn't anyone else think something really shady is going on here.. I mean I know its unlikely, but this is NK's way of getting athletes, and a delegation (agents) into the Olympics
t1_dstt1vf	1	*	Oooo. That's a very good flag for this purpose. It's very clearly dissimilar to both the north and south flags, and has an aesthetic similar to peace-striving organizations' flags!
t1_dstoxo0	1	*	This is a step towards reconciliation.
t1_dstmpho	1	*	Is this real?!?
t1_dstycb9	0	*	Now if only North and South Dakota could do the same.
t1_dsto5jj	1	*	Thanks Trump!
t1_dsuhj09	1	*	I feel like this is a rouse. 
t1_dsu55u2	1	*	Hurrah! 
t1_dstpmmz	1	*	I'd love to see the North Korean reporting on the Olympics, and how dominating the North Korean Athletes were winning all of the medals...
t1_dstq9p8	1	*	This is some of the best news I've heard in years! Fucking awesome!
t1_dsu3ca8	1	*	Sanctions must be working then, what a pathetic excuse of a charm offensive.
t1_dstqq8x	1	*	Comrades at last...
t1_dsto80z	1	*	The emotional whiplash....it's real.
t1_dstuwor	1	*	Man fuck the Japanese, trying to get these plans cancelled. Its as it they really do want NK to nuke them when the situation becomes irreparable
t1_dsu77lw	1	*	This flag would be definitely better:   http://kascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tide-Pods-unidose-021-opt.jpg 
t1_dstqb89	1	*	I wonder how many of the NK athletes will try to defect once they see the wonders of the south.
t1_dstrja0	1	*	So which flag is it going to be?
t1_dstpmc6	1	*	I don't think this will stop a regime which thinks it needs a nuclear weapon to survive from attaining it's goal. But this seems good.
t1_dstqdkq	1	*	This would be a good movie
t1_dsuewa1	1	*	i love it...the children shall show us the way to peace....
t1_dsu4llh	0	*	Can't the north and the south wait a few more years so Trump doesn't think they get along because of him? 
t1_dsu8woi	0	*	Goes a long way towards positive relations between the two nations. Could be possible we may see a united korea in our lifetime, if Trump and the GOP doesn't interfere and screw it all up.
t1_dstpuut	1	*	But Trump was supposed to cause WW3. That's what they told us. What's happening?
t1_dstqcnj	1	*	Yay. Women unite!
t1_dstsri3	1	*	Those conspiracy nutters predict this?  We actually might live past 2018! Woo hoo
t1_dstqi20	1	*	What does this mean? peace???

t1_dstsdfj	1	*	what parallel dimension are we in now
t1_dstz9za	1	*	THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!
t1_dsucsh0	1	*	I don't think this relationship is going to go how South Korea thinks this is going to go.
t1_dsu22wy	1	*	Also at the paraolympics the next month.
t1_dsuf4em	1	*	United Korea = best Korea!? 
t1_dsu0u19	1	*	Trump actually did it. 
t1_dstp8r7	1	*	So when does Trump claim responsibility for resolving all of the conflicts between North and South Korea?  ^^^^^^^Please ^^^^^^^by ^^^^^^^god ^^^^^^^no ^^^^^^^let ^^^^^^^me ^^^^^^^be ^^^^^^^wrong.
t1_dsuaru4	1	*	Wonder how many DPRK athletes will choose to not return.
t1_dstu3fm	1	*	DRUMPH IS MAKING THEm cus he DoesNt KnOw the DiffErenCe!!!!!!
t1_dstqcy0	1	*	That's good 
t1_dstosug	1	*	*This once again proves that North Korea and the South Korea are colluding. It's not me who was colluding. Believe me.* - DT probably
t1_dsts09c	1	*	The Korea's have more unity than the U.S. 
t1_dstp83w	1	*	A good prop bet for this olympics is how many of the North Koreans defect. 
t1_dstxzwz	1	*	Is it gonna be the old [Korean flag](http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/k/kr-old.gif) that they carry?
t1_dstqy29	1	*	I'll start sewing a Wolverine flag
t1_dstr3q4	1	*	Trump tweet taking credit for this in 3...2....1.....
t1_dstq6h8	1	*	Is it true?
t1_dsv0e01	0	*	8 years, 8 YEARS and the best obama could do was murder Qadaffi and bring about  a refugee crisis , less than 2 years in and President Trump is ready to reunite the Koreas!!
t1_dstt0ky	1	*	i think the 2 Korea realize that they should be united and live together in peace
t1_dston3v	1	*	Women's Ice Hockey? All 6 fans are going to be elated.
t1_dstd6s1	1	*	Alright. It's officical. I'm cheering them on for womens ice hockey. LETS GO!!
t1_dsty82r	1	*	If it helps, coach, I have no doubt that a unified hockey team will not reduce your odds of medaling, at all.
t1_dstu8yz	1	*	Damn got this news alert and was gonna post it for that karma but I guess I'm kinda late lol
t1_dstphf3	1	*	Has Trump taken credit for it yet?
t1_dsuc8jx	0	*	What is South Korea getting in return though? Unless SK is getting something serious in return, I have a hard time believing they would reward NK for their actions as of late.
t1_dstrei4	1	*	Wait a minute. Did Trump's Nuclear bully tactics actually work to get SK and NK talking? Wtf. 
t1_dsup80k	0	*	Thank you Trump. Collapse a couple bunkers and disabling their guidance systems makes anyone a little more agreeable. Lol
t1_dstwm3f	1	*	Serious question: how are you selected to be an athlete and not a labor camp detainee? Everything I've heard and read about North Korea makes a career fair sound hard to believe
t1_dstudvw	1	*	Imagine if they out of nowhere pulled a North Korean flag out what a shit show will it be 
t1_dsttxi4	1	*	Seems NK really wanted to get in. They view the Olympics as tradition despite the event losing hype the past few years. 
t1_dsts3rw	0	*	If they unify or settle to end their feud i really hope its not during trumps term.
t1_dstutjx	1	*	Trump senpai!
t1_dsu0lpl	1	*	If I were nk athlete I'd make my escape asap
t1_dsty24o	0	*	When are we going to see a unified eSports team though? That would be the thing to really unite the North and South!
t1_dstzfdq	1	*	Thanks Trump! 
t1_dsugdby	1	*	It's a step in the right direction. Hopefully in the next 20 years it will be called Korea.
t1_dsty9ef	1	*	In before the  north Korean olympians kill the south ones and take over the world. 
t1_dstpd7r	1	*	Everyone is aware this recent out reach is to buy enough time to perfect their atmosphere re-entry technology for the nuclear and recently announced biological weapons programs, right?
t1_dstrqoc	0	*	Hoe. Lee. Fuk.
t1_dstzv3y	1	*	It's amazing what our Dear Lord Trump can accomplish in his first full year just with his tweets alone. Beautiful!  /s
t1_dstyvst	1	*	In unrelated news, South Korean flag bearers die of mysterious poisoning while holding the flag...
t1_dsu6m9i	1	*	We need to get those NK guys laid everyday.
t1_dsu8ppc	1	*	It is a sad day when North and South Korea get along better than Democrats and Republicans.
t1_dstqmqz	1	*	could it be the fact trump is SO ridiculous, that even north korea went shit, that's a lunatic that may just throw a nuke at us. OK lets get our shit together.
t1_dstxc5j	1	*	Just the calm before the storm.
t1_dsu0c8h	1	*	Too bad they're going to get absolutely slaughtered by team USA and team Canada!
t1_dstl8km	1	*	Crap, who am I going to invade as a distraction now if I get indicted?  - some US President probably
t1_dstqhkj	1	*	Maybe they can fix shit without nuclear armageddon
t1_dstxpf4	1	*	please let this be a start to peace......please nk....
t1_dstu88e	1	*	Wow, nukes really do solve problems
t1_dsu2jyf	1	*	Holy shit I didnt think Id see that in my lifetime 
t1_dstwsj4	1	*	I think Im getting way too excited about this. Im not the most politically knowledgeable but to see such rigid countries taking such large strides to be peaceful warms my heart a ton. 
t1_dsu7nph	1	*	Wow this is great progress we may see peaceful slow unification in our lifetime this is great 
t1_dsu0fko	1	*	North Korea is getting meek, they stepped down from their high horse. Many thanks to Mister Trump for taming the beast.
t1_dstp822	1	*	Taking steps away from nuclear war is a pleasant surprise these days.
t1_dsust0i	1	*	They owe this to Trump!  
t1_dsu0ogw	1	*	well this is good news. hopefully trump stays out of this...
t1_dsu6cig	1	*	North Korea- out malnourished athletes obviously arent winning shit, I say we team up with south, if they win anything we will claim we carried them when we get home
t1_dsutgra	1	*	Which flag?
t1_dsug914	1	*	I'm 63, was born in 1954 and lived thru the cold war.  We used to have nuclear attack drills in grade school.  The Berlin Wall coming down was a big deal to me.  This gives me almost the same feeling.
t1_dsu85jw	1	*	Cant we all just get along? Maybe so. 
t1_dstulaw	1	*	A step in the right direction 
t1_dstvweu	1	*	all Trumps fault

t1_dstsamg	1	*	Amazing job President Trump!
t1_dstpbkn	1	*	I smell a great 30 for 30 in the works.
t1_dstztp1	1	*	Well I suppose if South Korea takes the bait here we won't have to worry about collateral damage.
t1_dstwljr	1	*	Imagine a truly unified Korea. Less starvation, more Starcraft. Everyone wins.
t1_dsuexs0	0	*	So when does Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize? Pretty sure Obama got it sooner and had accomplished less.
t1_dstxdif	1	*	Thank you Trump
t1_dsu0sav	1	*	Hopefully they can show the rest of the world how to put aside ones differences and seek resolution. 
t1_dstpzw1	1	*	As a Canadian I look forward to our ladies crushing this unified team

t1_dsug68l	1	*	Hey cool how about stopping another North Korean from dying of starvation?
t1_dsuqsms	1	*	Anyone think NK's athlete's will actually be spies?
t1_dstqba1	1	*	Nice political evasive tactic to pander to the naive folks that truly think North Korea wants anything that even remotely resembles peace or unity. 
t1_dsufcws	1	*	So out of Trump's warmongering, some peace bloomed.
t1_dststcb	1	*	Trump is pissed.

t1_dsr430q	1	*	Good for China, as a humanitarian, I could not be happier.
t1_dsrim8n	1	*	Joe Rogan was just talking about this. Here it is.

t1_dsr2013	0	*	If you looked at a satellite view of this, it literally looks like one of those square bandaids.  Appropriate.
t1_dsr5a39	1	*	If only china could say some shit like we have cleaner air than you america then the climate change problem would probably be solved in a few decades.
t1_dsr7iwk	1	*	I actually wondered why not just build a huge air purifier and now china has done it. Hopefully it makes other countries and cities do the same. 
t1_dsr1vza	1	*	As designed by Dysonxaeufe0f (patent pending).
t1_dsr0cpw	1	*	It must cost a fortune to change the filters every month
t1_dsrck3x	1	*	Good work
t1_dsr1nws	1	*	i love air purifiers !
t1_dsr4dyv	1	*	Yeah, but changing the filter...  
t1_dsrv5er	1	*	Wouldn't air be measured in cubic units instead of squares, since its considered a gas?
t1_dsrcsqs	1	*	Instead of spending billions in state funding to fight pollution, maybe we could just fine polluters and generate revenue.
t1_dsr7x9w	1	*	Amazon prime? 
t1_dsrj783	1	*	What does it cost to power that?

t1_dsr929s	1	*	Finally the genophage can commence!
t1_dsr2diz	1	*	Didn't the netherlands build the previous largets? 
t1_dsr44d8	1	*	I was hoping the world will evolve as China and USA compete. But instead US is going after North Korea. This is genuinely sad. 
t1_dsr3qgf	1	*	I like it, but its a shame that these even need to be built 
t1_dsr6jsy	1	*	I live in a slightly small city and smog is bad here. Can see shit floating through air.  stoned and meant to reply to someone but i am lost
t1_dsrddvj	1	*	Looks like a tower in code lyoko 
t1_dsrddvm	1	*	Imagine how much the filter replacements cost.  The filters for my two foot purifier are insanely expensive.
t1_dsr7r3h	1	*	Symptom killer. Root saver.
t1_dsr7yxi	1	*	What they don't tell you is that replacement filters cost 90% of the original cost, and they'll stop selling them once the new model comes out in spring.
t1_dsr3wp5	1	*	I'm getting some Mass Effect Genophage vibes from this.
t1_dsr1xxo	1	*	funny. I used to imagine something like this would one day be build. I would think ''man if the air pollution is that bad then why not build a giant air filter?

t1_dsrby7y	1	*	while overpopulation remains the elephant in the room
t1_dsr6om1	0	*	Only china or india would need this.
t1_dsrlpy8	1	*	They need a purifier 16,731,398,964 feet high to reduce smog  levels around the world. That's around 5099730km.  The moon is about 384,400km from earth. 
t1_dsr9rjy	0	*	Can this also absorb carbon dioxide?
t1_dsr4wcc	1	*	Unfortunately, the energy required to operate the filter outputs more carbon emmisions and pollution than it sequesters.
t1_dsrei5v	1	*	Or.. you know... plant some trees. 
t1_dsrj4ew	1	*	[I remember last time they tried this](https://imgur.com/gallery/gX3lZGz)

t1_dsr35de	1	*	Hey I had this mod in sim city 4
t1_dsr17c0	1	*	We're living in a Futurama episode. Next we're gonna solve global warming by dropping a giant ice cube into the ocean.
t1_dsr1h81	1	*	That filter is gonna be a bitch to clean...

t1_dsr19dh	1	*	Holy crap - this is actually quite sick.
t1_dsr4afn	0	*	Does the production of technology like this create a net zero impact on the environment? How long does it usually take for things like to potentially reverse the damage? 
t1_dsr23id	0	*	Stupid question maybe..  Why don't we put those everywhere? 
t1_dsrec8h	1	*	Great! Now they need about 960,000 more of those!
t1_dsrc17b	1	*	Imagine that great day when they don't need it anymore and it gets demolished.
t1_dsri4ux	1	*	I need this in my office.... people be coughing 
t1_dsr5cxf	1	*	Do air purifiers give off any pollution or otherwise harmful emissions? 
t1_dsrl0j0	1	*	I think we need more of these towers. Can they make some that  absorb co2?

t1_dsss2a7	1	*	Yeah and has anyone gone and checked if nothing really happened for all we know part of the islands are now a radioactive craters.
t1_dst2rwp	1	*	Is this false alarm also Trump's fault somehow?
t1_dsrs2n9	1	*	North Korea's laughing at the world right now

t1_dskrz9o	1	*	Oh no. People from Turkey wont travel here. Sounds like Trump is getting his way after all.
t1_dslzvb0	1	*	At the same time  they plead for the retraction of German travel warnings issued due to terrorist attacks and arbitrary arrests.
t1_dsl8hvc	1	*	Love it. Hilarious
t1_dsm7619	1	*	The US doesn't have that many terrorist attacks. I think you're confusing it with mass shootings. Mass shootings are far more common. 
t1_dskvxk5	0	*	Oh please turkey. as if we couldn't get without your warnings. It's Political. No real danger.
t1_dsl5okr	1	*	OK Turkey I get that you want to jump on this new normal of spit on him brothers but you might be one of the countries that just sort-of shouldn't.
t1_dslm28m	1	*	Good advice.

t1_dtujtlv	1	*	I dont see how thats any better than Iran requiring women wear hijabs.
t1_dtuhmnl	1	*	Good. We have tons of other laws protecting people from things they should no better than to do, this is no different. Right on Denmark.
t1_dtupqm3	1	*	let freedom decide forget fear.  Let each individual choose.  Laws like these are oppressive. theres an old saying about not giving up liberties in the name of safety round here anyway.
t1_dtunzl3	0	*	This isn't productive. If they choose to wear it, I don't see the problem. If some force out of their control forces them to wear it, then I see a problem. A ban will hurt as much as it helps here.

t1_duxr0ck	1	*	It's starting to look like many countries are going to legalize drugs within a decade.
t1_duxjn0t	1	*	Like Portugal. 3rd most peaceful country in the world. 
t1_duy1wbo	1	*	Does it impair your ability to blow the head off an Ivan at five hundred meters?  No.  Then I don't care, legalize it.
t1_duwz1uj	1	*	Legalise, regulate, and make abuse a public health issue. Done.
t1_duxmu1v	1	*	They just need to look at Portugal to see an example of how well that has worked.

t1_dtcqvd6	1	*	Why do I care about this? Hell, I think retweeting him is bad for him in most cases... 
t1_dtcpis9	1	*	I think we should send Trump to Russia to run against Putin and see how many tweets he gets.
t1_dtcytw5	1	*	Ah 500k tweets won the election. Mystery solved 
t1_dtd7ebm	1	*	Quick find a way to blame Hillary
t1_dtcbvmz	0	*	Would be curious to know how many Russian bots have retweeted Trump since the inauguration 
t1_dtcs7os	1	*	Because I didn't see my timeline on Facebook 90% pro Hillary Clinton at the last months of the election. Yeah, that never happened.
t1_dtd5m0e	1	*	And only idiots on twitter saw them. Whats the point? Ive never been in twitter dont know how to use and voted for trump, Russias fault clearly 
t1_dtcwmtt	1	*	If anyone here speaks German: https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9268-social_bots_fake_news_und_filterblasen  Quite interesting talk about twitter bots and how to (or rather now) detect them.
t1_dtcwfnq	1	*	Half of twitter is actually made up of bots, I'm sure many of these bots were talking to each other aimlessly. The real crime is that twitter is still a thing

t1_dtcf3tp	1	*	In a perfect world the number of tweets wouldn't even indirectly affect the outcome of 2016 US election, but what can you do...
t1_dtco4nv	1	*	I understand that what the Republicans is wrong but what does retweeting something do?
t1_dtcvhkn	1	*	Nobody I know who voted for Trump even has a Twitter account, much less get their political ideas from it.

t1_dsj1aeb	1	*	weird, you think they'd be super into it - after all, what better way to show that there's nothing here?
t1_dsj14o1	1	*	Of course he wont. Hes on the take too. Republicans are so corrupt at this point it may take 20 years to clean this mess up if we even get the chance. 
t1_dsj0cd1	1	*	If he did, then Russia would investigate and make public all the meddling the US does in elections all over the world. 
t1_dsilhq9	1	*	We must be spending all our investigative power on the DNC and FBI.. who abused powers to meddle in our election.
t1_dsin9ek	1	*	I think a lot of lobbying firms are backed with Russian money, so a lot of officials have Russia to thank for putting them in office (not just Trump). They don't want to risk exposing themselves.
t1_dsidllq	1	*	Republicans corrupt as fuck?  Who would have thought?
t1_dsicvmg	1	*	Like all Republican politicians, Corker will be a seditious traitor to the very end.

t1_dsipgzk	1	*	Why would he want to??? His supreme leader can't do no wrong.
t1_dsimr53	0	*	Why would he? There's a special prosecutor and the FBI.   Do you want every person in government to investigate something we know happens and have dedicated investigations for already?

t1_dsb491i	1	*	So deeper water is actually seeing corresponding increases in oxygen levels.  Interesting.
t1_dsaer5q	0	*	I don't really know shit about this so feel free to correct me but if the oxygen disappears, shouldn't the water go with it? You'd be left with just the hydrogen bits. Right?

t1_dsg0074	0	*	Call me cynical, but I think this move to make better relations with S.Korea is to try and add a wedge between the US and S.Korea. 
t1_dsff9s1	1	*	I'm just curious at to what Noko's top athletes look like.   I assume these people are top class? Because there's no way a malnourished civilian could possibly compete in an Olympic event.

t1_dt34jzz	1	*	Of course.
t1_dt2xopu	1	*	Its a funny world where you wake up to stories like this everyday. At this point Im just like yeah that sounds like something he would do rather than being surprised.

t1_dt32wr8	1	*	I really should just start replying well, of course he did to all of these threads.
t1_dt3kl95	1	*	The issue here is less that Trump does racist accents, and more that he can be easily manipulated on foreign affairs as long as people play to his preconceptions.
t1_dxjxt1y	1	*	This is so funny. The arrogant chaiwala dumbass deserves every ridicule in every aspect. 
t1_dt2zl3u	1	*	Everyone knows that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...

t1_dt31zpj	1	*	I tried to say it was dementia, but Trump's doctor insists there isn't any, leaving the only excuse for his actions as rampant stupidity.  Sad!
t1_dt36337	1	*	I thought he would have loved an arrogant strongman like Modi. 
t1_dt31yab	0	*	LOL... considering how many people make fun of the way Trump speaks, I think we can call this one even.

t1_dskc0wd	1	*	If he plans on just going where people will like him he will have to stay at home a lot.
t1_dskbr5m	0	*	The man who said he'd be super tough on ISIS is pussying out on going to Britain because he's afraid of gossip? I'm honestly not surprised.
t1_dsjyrel	1	*	https://youtu.be/5dLVo0
t1_dsk9a4f	1	*	It's not often that you wake up to such good news!

t1_dsk7v48	1	*	Britain is a no go zone anyway. 
t1_dskipsi	1	*	Whys he being such a shithole?
t1_dska4jl	1	*	Trump always amuses us.
t1_dsjw7oa	1	*	Says reports. I hate the news these days.
t1_dskbbxl	1	*	Shithole country anyway
t1_dskibb5	1	*	He will be welcome, because Britain is in ever deeper sh*t with all around brexit and needs US more than ever.
t1_dsk9kyn	1	*	By that same logic, he should leave America.
t1_dskj61c	1	*	Snowflake
t1_dskapby	1	*	He fears ? Understatement of the year! The Queen herself canceled their meeting, a thing never done before!
t1_dskdzcf	1	*	He's correct, he's not welcome.
t1_dsknuyh	1	*	In unrelated news, the price of eggs and custard pies dropped precipitously today.  
t1_dsk8ztx	1	*	Can we make him cancel his existance here, in the U.S., because he's not welvome here, either?

t1_dskfe58	1	*	He's right. He isn't welcome. I wouldn't spit on him if he was on fire 
t1_dsk8pv6	1	*	The only sensible thing that came out of this administration. While they are at it, at most of the US on that list. Oh shit is that why he only goes to mar a lago and the WH?
t1_dsk5lgl	1	*	So he'll cancel his trips to most places?
t1_dska8mn	1	*	Good. Hes not. 
t1_dsjsct8	1	*	Sounds pretty considerate of him really.
t1_dskhtyq	1	*	Why wouldn't he want to go to that shithole?
t1_dske0ph	0	*	I wonder how much of that is sulking that Obama got invited to Prince Harry's  wedding and he didn't. 
t1_dskam69	1	*	Maybe he should fix his attitude and watch what he says that way he can be potentially welcomed in the future. 
t1_dsk4xs9	1	*	Is there something wrong with sucking cock? 
t1_dskfrvl	1	*	They've already confirmed those fears.
t1_dskklp1	1	*	Hasn't the UK already made it clear that he can come but isn't really welcome there?

t1_dskdjk7	1	*	I'd rather he'd have come tbh, no way he'd be able to take the jeering
t1_dskj5hz	0	*	Special relationship to this, in just one short year.  Tremendous. 
t1_dsk3a0o	1	*	He should just stay in the Trump properties he owns then.  I don't think he can go anywhere he's welcome.

t1_dskfm9w	1	*	Not only is he a fucking idiot.  His reasoning is completely false.
t1_dska2rc	1	*	You're not human, are you?
t1_dskj6rx	1	*	Yeah - he won't be welcome
t1_dsk5v1o	1	*	What a, ahem, PUSSY. 
t1_dskay7n	1	*	Unusually, he's not wrong.
t1_dsk6rq3	1	*	So he wants to stay in his safe space? I thought only sensitive liberals had those.
t1_dslevv3	1	*	He's welcome so long as accompanied by an adult
t1_dsk8f8s	1	*	Maaaannnn! I'd already made my Trumps a cunt sign!  But this may be a trick and his little orange hands could still come? 
t1_dskd4ac	1	*	He's barely 'welcome' in this country. 
t1_dsk12wt	1	*	Courage and grace under pressure. 
t1_dskb5kw	1	*	Great news. Britain has enough issues without his toxic presence! Just gutted we didn't cancel his trip for him! 
t1_dsk851x	1	*	He is such a little bitch.
t1_dsk7072	1	*	So, he won't visit one of his country's biggest allies because the building is on the wrong street...  Banking this excuse for when I have to visit the in laws. 
t1_dsk5ffs	1	*	He should cancel his trip to America as well. 
t1_dsk99yz	1	*	I just want to say that video of all you brits singing about him being a cunt over there, that was fucking beautiful. 
t1_dskbzmk	1	*	As much as I don't like him, this is bad news for the country really, a tasty trade deal would go nicely right about now
t1_dskaryi	1	*	I mean he's spot on, we don't want him here.
t1_dsk8w9e	1	*	LOL!!! Good luck!
t1_dsk8w9b	1	*	It is staggering what damage he has done to the country in such a short time. 
t1_dsk873o	1	*	It's funny. He's insulted by the scale of the welcome. He's a pompous idiot that requires everyone kiss his arse. 
t1_dsk7eiq	1	*	Add rest of Europe to that list. Russia however will welcome him with open arms and call him .
t1_dsk7dmu	1	*	So he's just never going to leave the southern states?
t1_dsk5zkh	1	*	What a pussy. 
t1_dskaq95	1	*	Trump is barely welcome in America. Hes definitely not wanted here

t1_dskk235	1	*	hahahahahahaha

t1_dskags5	1	*	Well that'll free up some time, so he can give a moral boosting visit to troops in Afghanistan or Iraq perhaps?

t1_dtk5dwo	1	*	As a person whos been circumcised right after birth it pains me to read comments about botched circumcisions. Ive never had complications or sensitivity issues or a weird scar. Im sorry guys. 
t1_dtje97v	0	*	Lots of opinions on that one. I wonder how many objectors are in fact circumcised. 
t1_dtjzbd1	1	*	Women know why they want their men circumsized...
t1_dtjrzdx	1	*	As an uncircumcised man, can someone who has done the procedure later in life tell me how sex feels before and after. What is the difference?
t1_dtiwh6u	0	*	Here in the U.S. if we raised the statute of limitations for genital mutilation to 20 years, and 18 year olds could start suing the doctors who circumcised them.....circumcision would stop instantly.
t1_dtjw9hh	0	*	End genital mutilation.
t1_dtkcilo	1	*	Seems unpopular in this thread but Im glad I was circumcised. Maybe thats cause its the only thing Ive known but seems like it was the right move for me
t1_dtk2yzz	0	*	My penis hurts after sex and I'm usually one and done. Never had multiple sessions in a night. I'm cut. 
t1_dtji3tp	1	*	Did you know on average uncut dicks are actually slightly thicker due the foreskin with its extra layers of skin it provides the penis.

t1_dtjq3ph	1	*	In 7 years I'll read this again. Nothing will change
t1_dtj7kzi	1	*	I personally am against circumcision. My brother is cut while I am not. The doctor told my parents when I was born that I didn't have enough foreskin to worry about. 
t1_dtjqop5	1	*	This is a bad idea. Medical issues arise from uncircumcision.
t1_dtjehmz	0	*	I'm so glad this is the norm now I got so much shit in High school for being uncircumcised. Glad to see the other side seeing the feeling. God fuck the U.S. and our taboo.
t1_dtj900l	0	*	Great news! No one should have an unnecessary surgery done on them that permanently removes a highly sensitive part of their body without consent.   Circumcision is abuse and mutilation, period. 
t1_dtjhscs	0	*	Women are supposedly more orgasmic with uncut penii.

t1_dtkf0wm	1	*	Shouldn't it just be illegal, period, to mutilate your kids?
t1_dtk5d0s	1	*	Ladies, let's return the favor turn this thread into a conversation about FGM!

t1_dtjo6mi	1	*	Circumcision for boys?  Ohhhh, you mean male genital mutilation.
t1_dtjt1o9	1	*	good, fucking heinous act
t1_dtjcoo6	1	*	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark - it's your uncut, infected penis...is what I would comment if I were one of those people who think circumcision is healthy.

t1_dst51d0	1	*	Someone should start a YouTube channel or Facebook page called why all the packaging? to show the absurds we face everyday with tons of products.
t1_dst4gv8	1	*	Too long. 
t1_dssxa46	1	*	The EU needs to declare a fatwa. 
t1_dssjbwg	0	*	So that means Glass and Stainless Steel only.  Because the rest aren't recyclable.  Wood is *renewable* and would work ok.  Oh, wait, that's paper.   You can't recycle foodwaste paper.
t1_dst05g6	0	*	Holy crap, why is the EU so amazing?
t1_dsu4it2	1	*	Everything should just be in cans.
t1_dstw273	1	*	I had a very brief moment of panic and confusion when I read EU declares war on-
t1_dssr5kn	1	*	2030 lol. Should have been 2003.
t1_dstjelg	1	*	Meanwhile, here in the US the plastic industry has convinced our germaphobic population that EVERY drink served MUST have a straw! An estimated 400 MILLION straws thrown away every single day!
t1_dstl1uq	1	*	Wax paper, folks 
t1_dst1c71	0	*	Won't make any difference. It's nearly all reusable or recyclable anyway. What is needed is a massive reduction in the use of plastic packaging. 
t1_dssztb3	1	*	After visiting India what ever we do will be ruined by their treatment of plastics and rubbish 
t1_dssed4l	0	*	Good! The amount of plastic packaging has got to crazy levels in the last decade. 
t1_dsthyyz	1	*	Why wait until 2030? Make it 2020!
t1_dsj1gaw	0	*	Hmmm.  Its well known China does not want a united Korea.   
t1_dtyogym	1	*	And here I've been thinking Canada is way out in front of the US lately.  Come on, Canada, you can do better than homeopathy!
t1_dtziws2	1	*	The media got it wrong, Ontario was just trying to promote staying hydrated.
t1_dtzrsv9	1	*	Their astrology curriculum has far-reaching implications for the financial industry.
t1_dtyxvn3	1	*	Fuck that cunt Kathleen Wynne.  That spineless woman deserves to be dead after what she has done in power.
t1_dtymaol	1	*	There's already an homeopathy program it's called marketing.
t1_dtzkmza	1	*	The paradox of tolerance, the notion that if a society is tolerant without limit, it will be seized upon by the intolerant.
t1_dtyln2g	1	*	And I had to get student loans to learn black magic.
t1_dtzb4jr	1	*	So the latest generation that abandoned science for ideology suddenly believes in more pseudo science. I am so surprised, this has never happened in the history of humankind.
t1_dtzqea2	1	*	Shit like this is why I see a hard right future for Canada. The rural poor canadians are getting restless.   Sounds familiar.
t1_dtyzzwe	1	*	If homeopathy had any merit simple sea water would be the most powerful medicine on earth. 
t1_dtyw3bl	1	*	I'd rather fund homeopathy than feminist studies 
t1_dtytm3j	1	*	their funding level should follow the same thinking as homeopathic dilution.
t1_dtyshuw	1	*	There's also accredited schools that teach chiropractics and astrology. I do wonder why there's accredited degrees in pseudoscience.  
t1_dtyo3qk	0	*	Isnt this similar to someone studying 4 years in religion?
t1_du1k79s	1	*	It only needs some vodka; 5-10 people, spread around the auditorium with airhorns and someone to livestream to twitch for this to become a smashing success.
t1_dtyr9pw	0	*	Yeah, academia is useless now, the hippies and bullshit artists ruined it. Where do we go from here?
t1_dtyq6w8	1	*	Imagine the spoon as a mouth
t1_dtzaxmz	1	*	There's no outrage, no one cares
t1_dtykrta	1	*	Poodiggery and poppycock I say.
t1_dtyuw2j	1	*	Did anyone else see the spoon in this thumbnail as a mouth, making a weird cartoon-ish face with the eyes? 
t1_dtytn7w	1	*	They probably needed to dilute the news  a little further
t1_du01psw	1	*	The Ontario government should fund 1 Canadian dollar for homeopathy.
t1_dtytntd	1	*	I said nothing when chiropractors started calling themselves doctors. But this is too far. 
t1_dtyfnac	0	*	So they are fully selling snake oil now?  Where can I get my con man degree?
t1_dtykgiq	1	*	> including options for care and different methods.  I would like to options and methods that works, thank you.
t1_dtz9a13	1	*	People who support homeopathy in the academic circles usually have financial connections to the industry.
t1_dtypfwl	1	*	Obligatory [explanation of homeopathy by James Randi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZK6mLY2Hfg). 
t1_dtz4tpi	1	*	The thumbnail for the article looks like the snapchat filter without a nose
t1_dtytb5e	1	*	Pseudo-science? In Ontario? Noooooo. 
t1_dtzflbn	1	*	They kind of backed themselves into an ideological corner on this. If all narratives are true regardless of factual basis they have to open the door to every stupid idea or else they are oppressive.
t1_dtyuve7	1	*	I had to unfollow someone after his wife got a doctorate in homeopathy....pretty much snake oil
t1_dtysh48	1	*	No fucking way. No. 
t1_dtyssf4	1	*	It is the air guitar of medicine is a great call.
t1_dtz640i	1	*	The spoon looks like a mouth. 
t1_dtz1wm2	1	*	I wonder what led to this.
t1_dtyvjpf	1	*	The worst that comes from this (besides wasted funds), is a bunch of scientific articles that can't be replicated, thus disproving homeopathy techniques.
t1_dtywl2p	0	*	Psuedo-science with results is science.
t1_dtyw5y2	1	*	o canada.....
t1_dtyvbr0	1	*	Justin Trudeau wholeheartedly endorses this to benefit all of peoplekind.
t1_dtyv7pv	1	*	Don't worry, most Ontarians are very aware how completely abysmal our provincial government is... the problem is their competition is just as retarded if not worse...  help us.
t1_dtyrn7p	1	*	For a second I thought the spoon was a smile, looked creepy af and cant unsee it now
t1_du0b307	1	*	Get this shit out of schools, jesus christ
t1_dtysnog	1	*	There's a National Homeopathy Hospital in Mxe9xico, of 'high specialty' of course.  Holy shit do the central states of my country get to squander funds.
t1_dtyxiw7	1	*	This is absolutely worth outrage
t1_dtzfr1c	1	*	Do you want to lose your status as an accredited institution? Because this is how the province revokes your accreditation.
t1_dtya2ew	1	*	'magic bullshit'
t1_dtyi6gt	1	*	If you make a notation in an accounting log that you've spent $0 to fund it, homeopathy works just as well as if you'd spent thousands
t1_dtywic4	1	*	Canada eh...
t1_dtz0ske	1	*	Pitchforks?  Torches?  Both?
t1_dtzprjb	1	*	fake science
t1_dtz498c	1	*	The quotes arent really necessary.
t1_dtysasj	1	*	Katherine Wynne turning into Katherine Lose
t1_dtyhec7	1	*	Mind hunters anyone?
t1_dtyw678	1	*	Sounds like a touchy situation. 
t1_dtylxym	1	*	What's up with his upper lip..? more than tickling I bet.
t1_dtysg8r	1	*	Better a tickler than a pickler?
t1_dsm9npv	1	*	Hmm, they're okay, the best bread recipes are Italian. The Romans knew their bread and wine.
t1_dutilf5	0	*	They do have a nice anthem to be honest
t1_duu4azm	1	*	It's the Olympics. Who really cares that much? So what if they sing their song, in a week noone in the US will even care outside of athlete endorsements.
t1_dus3nik	1	*	Come again? 
t1_dtivh1l	1	*	Remember their latest elections? Less surprising now, huh?
t1_dv3yfgn	0	*	Wrong uri
t1_ds344rg	1	*	if its 'same job' then there is the out.. 
t1_ds2sjxc	1	*	Is this typically a big problem in Iceland or is this the same BS argument that feminists make in the US?
t1_ds25quw	1	*	Are there no Economists in Iceland?
t1_dtwb7h8	1	*	Don't worry, Canadian military equipment will actually put them at a strategic disadvantage. It is the long play.
t1_dujv5md	0	*	No one reads articles before commenting apparently. It says in the article that its meant to be a jab.
t1_duk815m	1	*	If this wasn't designed to be a jab at gays, I would ask if these are the equilivants to Milo in the US. 
t1_ds3gzci	0	*	not gonna happen..some people also said Trump may even end H1B program itself.  with words considers may there have been many false stories.
t1_ds3jx0t	1	*	Trump considers doing something actually good.  This is actually big news.
t1_ds3h1q4	0	*	I honestly have no faith that this will be done in a way that does anything but benefit employers.
t1_ds3njww	1	*	Sort of related. Last week there was an article that in India a lot of their tech service companies are laying people off. Majority are being replaced by automation.  
t1_dsd3irp	0	*	Generalization a relgion over a single person that is known to have little knowledge about the religion itself, its utter stupidity.
t1_duabc6o	1	*	Affectations, said Gertrude Stein when she heard the news of Isadora Duncans death, can be dangerous.
t1_dtq3sq5	1	*	Weve already made our decision
t1_dtqr6pl	1	*	This whole thing has been a mess. Kind of regret voting to leave now. 
t1_dtqpb6f	1	*	The people have voted and the Government has still not implemented proper border control, and now they try this nonsense.
t1_dtq41po	1	*	Alternate headline: politician wants to do the opposite of what was decided democratically. 
t1_dtrlvbo	1	*	The majority made their choice, and with that choice Europe's trust for UK died. We want you out, and to never return.
t1_dtpw7ea	1	*	Pretty sure the decision time is long gone with the referendum that has already happened.
t1_dtqfqef	1	*	Didn't they already decide?
t1_dtq8g1y	1	*	I guess the first referendum was meaningless then?
t1_dtrlte6	1	*	If the UK had a referendum every month it would probably fluctuate between remain and leave.
t1_dtqi4ht	1	*	British People were so confused when the vote was for brexit. If the vote was against brexit, there would be no second decision XD
t1_dtxmu7y	1	*	Okay, this proves it! The Don is actually **Kim Jong Il**. You heard it here first.
t1_dsoxwcf	1	*	Irrational Trump? Really? The Ayatollahs killing protesters, exporting terrorism in the Middle East are definitely the ultimate example of rationality!
t1_dsgzlo5	1	*	as someone who enjoys seafood, I support this. aim for the pilot houses imho
t1_du13opf	0	*	something fishy

t1_du8rdwl	0	*	Come on guys, I'm sure NK can take a joke right? Right? ...guys?
t1_dsib7hu	1	*	Looks like the typical remains of a spider feeding off moths/butterflies.  
t1_dsdbfhz	1	*	I remember this study when it was discussed in r/science about a month ago. The actual study did not increase the numbers affected by cancer that much and was not even the final word
t1_dsd98ie	0	*	Pretty much most steroidal treatments increase the likelihood of cancers. I'm now no longer surprised Lance Armstrong developed testicular cancer given how much performance enhancing drugs he took. 
t1_dselodj	1	*	a little late, so click bait
t1_duwpnlp	0	*	just waiting for my power bill to start going down ;)

t1_ds42naa	0	*	Stop allowing RT links. They're blatant Russian govt propaganda. 
t1_ds4b5om	1	*	Why is the leader of the USA such a friggin moron? Did his nanny drop him when he was little or something?

t1_ds449r5	0	*	What the FUCK was going through peoples minds when they voted for this guy???
t1_ds444bh	1	*	Funny how no one wanted a measuring contest with Obama's button......
t1_ds43sc2	1	*	What the fuck come on.
t1_ds4grqo	0	*	Stupid, but effective. Having nukes prevents other countries from using their own.
t1_ds4187f	1	*	... That's it, I'm done. Please nuke us we've gone too far and at this point radioactivity might be the only thing capable of sterilizing thst shit stain.

t1_ds44447	1	*	I thought the only winning move in thermonuclear war was not to play. I never would have guessed that it was a actually a dick measuring contest. 
t1_ds41mdx	1	*	It only seems bigger because of his tiny hands. 
t1_ds429vy	1	*	Whats with the dares to compare nuclear buttons bullshit? Trump is already ridiculous enough, can news outlets please stop exaggerating and making shit up?
t1_ds4bwq6	1	*	He kno da wey

t1_ds46yve	1	*	The god damn president of the United States should not be getting in public dick-measuring contests with leaders of enemy nations.      
t1_ds4ln50	1	*	...is this really what we've come to? A dick measuring contest between two nuclear armed leaders?
t1_ds4213n	1	*	Trump to Kim Jong-un: My ratings are in the toilet, hurry up and nuke California so I can get a war bump!

t1_ds44dto	1	*	I like his comment. I'm not even mad, its just gold
t1_ds4m2h8	1	*	It is mind boggling to me that actual living, breathing Americans voted to elect this man as their President.

t1_ds4ap9f	1	*	Twitter and every social media should suspend Donald trump accounts 
t1_ds4c9kh	1	*	Donald Trump is a reality TV star before anything else. Republicans love watching this shit.

t1_ds48jk2	1	*	Presidential shitposting is the best kind of shitposting. Absolutely sublime.
t1_ds454p7	1	*	Yea this shit isnt even funny anymore. Murica, muzzle your dog please. Threatening nuclear war via twitter is not cool.  Remember his tweets are considered official policy.  
t1_ds41g7l	0	*	So yeah.....   Honestly considering another country. Its all been said before but not under these circumstances. This is outrageous. The way our country is being run makes no sense.
t1_ds4do5x	0	*	I don't understand why people don't realize that this asshole is threatening nuclear war and making a scene to stay in power. He ain't doing shit.
t1_ds422b1	1	*	But please, tell me how Hillary was a warmonger who was gonna start WW3.

t1_ds41ww8	1	*	I think we should settle this whole thing with an actual literal dick measuring contest. Whoever has the less micro micro-penis wins. The other guy has to either give up nukes or lift sanctions. 
t1_ds43jjq	1	*	How is there not a line?? 
t1_ds4dows	1	*	Anyone else still shocked that Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America?

t1_dt82ac6	1	*	That escalated quickly.

t1_duq0fm7	1	*	lmao I love how the 90's was so bad that now Russian's just can't stop cheating. It's like they gave up on playing fair as a whole for everything, even sports. lol

t1_dsr643p	0	*	Well, that's just tough, we voted out. Get on with it.  Many people voted out because they didn't know what Brexit is or what it's about. They should have informed themselves earlier before voting.

t1_dt8vakf	1	*	I hope she fucking tries.
t1_dt91735	1	*	She should agree to it and then ignore him when he visit.  And if he tries to confront, just say fake news and move on.
t1_dt95zkt	1	*	This is fake. He never said he wanted to ban protests. Please stop falling for purposely misleading headlines.
t1_dt8v76z	1	*	Kids say the darndest things
t1_dt8xo3n	1	*	So, he's against free speech?
t1_dt8tgnz	1	*	Whos a snowflake?
t1_dt93rhd	1	*	What a snowflake.

t1_dt8w6wc	1	*	The leader of the free world asking someone to ban freedom
t1_dt97m9c	1	*	So the orange goblin will never bother our shores again? Thank fuck. 
t1_dt8wglx	1	*	Welp, if nothing at this point has convinced anyone that TD is one of the worst world leaders in the history of human civilization, this could be it.. 
t1_dt97275	1	*	The president of the United States of America should support peoples' right to assemble even when they aren't Americans. 
t1_dt8u81g	1	*	He doesn't understand the British dose he?
t1_dt900an	1	*	UK here,   L   O   L 
t1_dt99i4z	0	*	How does a reporter from a small online publication get access to a phone conversation of two world leaders.  seems kind of fishy.
t1_dta9qeu	1	*	Can we agree that the title is misleading? 
t1_dt9nqpy	1	*	Trump is a fucking fool.
t1_dt916l0	1	*	So we should encourage protesting and keep the bastard at home
t1_dt912pj	1	*	So he is telling another world leader to suspend one of OUR constitutional rights, the Right to Free Assembly? Incredible. Anything that offends him he wants to ban, Free Press and now Free Assembly.
t1_dt8s02k	1	*	Can we get him to say the same thing about the US?
t1_dt997l4	1	*	Awww, widdle Twump needs a safe space.

t1_dt97ely	1	*	What a sensitive snow flake of an orange bitch.
t1_dt8t0a0	1	*	What phrase do you guys use for Duces?
t1_dta1qmu	1	*	Maybe not being a cunt would help quell some of those protests. But I would rather have him never set foot on the British Isles if it can be helped. 
t1_dt8xsad	1	*	Why doesn't he stay out of America. Plenty of protesters here.
t1_dt8yvef	1	*	we'll manage  Everyone in the UK, probably
t1_dt8yven	1	*	That's like my shithead uncle threatening to never visit us again if we don't get rid of our dog. First thing my Mum would do is buy 10 more dogs. 
t1_dt959e7	1	*	I'm a snowflake. I need protection from the heat.
t1_dt8ymsp	1	*	The prime minister believes in OUR first amendment more than our own president. When Theresa May is the high road,  watch out!
t1_dt8wskn	1	*	LOL what kind of fucking idiot is this retard?
t1_dt8zfng	1	*	Really?  Who the fuck belives he said that? Thas so igonrant.

t1_dt8uhc1	1	*	Holy Christ how is this guy in office, he has never even looked at the US Constitution.
t1_dt8y8a9	1	*	U.S: Please take him, we don't want him.  Britain: you choose your democracy, now deal with the repercussions 
t1_dt8wzpa	0	*	Do people still believe hes an Alpha Male?
t1_dt9q91f	1	*	So the protests were a success?
t1_dt8veea	1	*	Good fucking luck ya shitgibbon
t1_dt97ie1	1	*	Aww, what a precious snowflake
t1_dt8tt12	1	*	The definition of snowflake, oh the irony!
t1_dt8v3nw	1	*	Taking bets on when he starts actually taking away first amendment rights from US citizens. Can I get a 2 months? How about 1?
t1_dt8w3ia	0	*	I'm surprised he hasn't tried to do that in the USA already.
t1_dt9afnx	1	*	Yeah Trump isnt authoritarian or anything!
t1_dt93fl6	1	*	And some people say free speech is under attack from the left
t1_dt8u4jn	1	*	She should tell him she will.   Then lie to his stupid lying face
t1_dt8wecl	1	*	Dear UK please don't, because fuck trump.  Sincerely America.

t1_dt8tg25	1	*	Isn't he officially not welcome there anyway? 
t1_dt8zz9p	1	*	Trump is such an insufferable git. 
t1_dt8x5ac	1	*	Looks like Trump just let out a ferocious poot and this photo was taken the second May got the first, ripe, hair-raising whiff.
t1_dt9078k	1	*	Meanwhile in South Africa theyre literally two months away from running out of water and having to use the military to distribute water rations, but I guess this is more important.
t1_dt8t15n	0	*	So now our Presidont wants to ban Freedom of Assembly (USA 1ST Amendment) for our Friends across the Atlantic? 
t1_dt8zekx	1	*	Question: Could we arrest Trump for inciting racial hatred? Or are we not allowed to arrest foreign heads of state?
t1_dt8u0r1	1	*	Did this actually happen or are they just reporting it? There are protests in the US all the time against the POTUS why would he care about protests in the UK. This straight up stinks of BS.
t1_dt8tewf	1	*	Don't threaten me with a good time -Theresa May
t1_dt8urpv	1	*	We need to end this  special relationship  anyway. 
t1_dt8urp2	1	*	I love my sundowning grifter president who's somehow lived his entire life in NYC and can't take some verbal abuse
t1_dt92v94	1	*	Is Oprah watching this post? You get gold and you get gold! Everybody gets gold!
t1_dt8z05l	1	*	Supreme leader needs a safe space haaaaaaahahah
t1_dt91ykp	1	*	Theresa May should say to Trump: My apologies, but we have this quaint notion we like to call 'Freedom of Speech'. 
t1_dt92zsv	1	*	Trump is a legend lol
t1_dt8u3mf	1	*	A President of United States whom doesnt believe in freedom of speech? Hm....
t1_dt8zcpk	1	*	0________0   How am I still surprised by this? 
t1_dt94ifi	1	*	So I guess we're just going to ignore that isn't what the article actually says?
t1_dt8yrya	1	*	May may have trumped trump
t1_dtecevv	1	*	Protest this Trump!
t1_dt8tvka	1	*	Oh boohoo. Did the protesters hurt the rotten orange's feelings?

t1_dt8unls	1	*	Trump is the biggest snowflake pos ever!
t1_dt8um8r	1	*	How about no. 
t1_dt8uikl	1	*	That's some Erdogan/Putin shit.
t1_dt916z6	1	*	As an American, I'm absolutely ashamed at our President and hate him. Citizens should have the right to protest when government does wrong.
t1_dt945ot	1	*	manchild
t1_dt9q9mf	1	*	UK redditors: Is it going to ruin your day knowing Donald Trump will not be visiting your country??
t1_dt8t7xd	1	*	That twat faced plonker should haul his arse over 'ere, we'll put on a bloody great row and show that us Brits are not willing to put up with his shite.
t1_dt8zvsl	1	*	Haha this guy is special sure no problem just stop a free country from protesting and Ill show no biggy at all easy lol

t1_dt8tyeq	1	*	Repeat after me Trump supporters.   Snow....Flake
t1_dt8yacv	1	*	The UK doesnt need Trump. LOL 
t1_dt8zct9	1	*	Poking the bear, eh? 
t1_dt93ach	1	*	Is that legal in Britain?  It's clearly unconstitutional in the US.
t1_dt9qhk5	0	*	Wait...what?  Holy fucking shit, this shit never seizes to amaze me ( in the wrong way obviously )
t1_dt9pgf9	1	*	Theresa, hey. Dont do it.   Signed, The American people
t1_dt90q2u	1	*	It's the right thing to do

t1_dt8xvbt	1	*	President Snowflake
t1_dt8v0s9	1	*	I wont sully my tiny ass hands with a visit unless you abscond from embracing your dirty rights. 
t1_dt97del	0	*	I think it is super un-American to say that you don't want people to be able to protest.
t1_dt8xyfv	1	*	You know that even when he has that ear piece in for the translator he still has no clue what is going on
t1_dt90681	1	*	Wasnt the right to protest why we cut ties with England in the first place? 
t1_dt8xicx	0	*	question: what has he done whilst president to effect the UK in a negative way? 
t1_dt8xopf	1	*	Has he not met that many British people? 
t1_dt8vg3d	1	*	So. I take it hes not going then?
t1_dt8xh36	1	*	Such a little bitch
t1_dt8zglb	1	*	Donald Trump tells Theresa May he won't visit the UK unless she bans the freedom of speech*
t1_dt8qz7a	1	*	Wah wah Im president of the United States and protesters hurt my feelings  What a joke
t1_dt8wxa5	0	*	These guys only care about free speech when it pertains to guns, religion or their ability to discriminate against people. If it doesnt fit their interests, ban it. 
t1_dt97a32	1	*	>Donald Trump tells Theresa May he won't visit the UK unless she bans protests  OMG - that is so 'Third World'  We don't have a President - we have a tribal leader.
t1_dt8rx89	1	*	Don't think he realises there are other countries in the world with free speech.
t1_dt8vlkm	1	*	What a delicate little flower that man is. It's too bad our country doesn't have strong leaders anymore.
t1_dt93rhm	0	*	You know youre a shitty president when you have to make a country ban protests before you arrive 
t1_dt8znx6	1	*	UK: Hes an idiot  US: He may be an idiot, but hes our idiot
t1_dt8tlyw	1	*	Such nonsense.
t1_dt907fy	1	*	What sucks is that link would be considered 'click-bait' if it was any other world leader but trump.
t1_dt95bj3	0	*	Ok what the actual fuck is wrong with this guy?
t1_ducatyb	1	*	I have one big facepalm for this stupid shit 
t1_dt96r65	1	*	Good on him. 
t1_dt8uykv	1	*	Donnie scared... poor poor Baby 
t1_dt8zrq3	1	*	The President of the United States wont visit unless they ban protests  How Un-American is that sentence???
t1_dt8zaed	1	*	The poor little man. Scared of protesters? 
t1_dt9hai6	1	*	Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
t1_dta09y1	1	*	The American secret societies sending  British allies info  https://youtu.be/haIMvy_Iv3E
t1_dt8vdke	1	*	You know, this is very obviously laughable.  But, at the same time, Donald Trump is President of the United States and Theresa May is the Prime Minster of England.  And TM is in-fucking-sane.
t1_dt97pb4	1	*	Is that a promise? -Theresa May
t1_dt8u0e2	1	*	Fucking coward. 
t1_dt9eo0a	1	*	We might have to discontinue the old literally Hitler saying if this guy continue on that path.
t1_dta29tq	1	*	Trump went on to say that he would not visit the UK unless there were guarantees that he would not be met with protests.  Interesting title..
t1_dt90p6d	1	*	Lol
t1_dt8ysl3	1	*	Does he mean protests in the UK at all or protests in his face wherever he goes for safety reasons? Because i wouldnt be surprised ig context changes this story.
t1_dt8t804	1	*	She is welcome to take him home. 
t1_dt8zfl3	1	*	We're not gonna protest! We're not gonna protest! We're not gonna protest!
t1_dt8zsmr	1	*	Please stifle the free speech of your citizens or I wont visit you. Oh no!
t1_dt8tgs8	1	*	LOL AT MY LIFE THIS MAN IS REALLY MY PRESIDENT
t1_dt8ubs7	1	*	This is a protest though...
t1_dt8ubsw	1	*	Donald Trump ready to colonize the UK.  
t1_dt949rf	1	*	What an American thing to say.
t1_dt8veka	1	*	what a snowflake
t1_dt8tln7	1	*	How about stop doing stuff where so many people feel the need to get in the streets and take hours out of their day just to let you know how much you suck? Good leaders don't see protests.
t1_dt8yshm	0	*	Anonymous source? Check.   Sensationalist headline? Check.   anti-Trump? Check.   To the top of Reddit it goes.
t1_dt98gi0	1	*	But Theresa! I don't like it when people say mean things about me! 
t1_dt8vr6x	1	*	Check your source! article statement by the Guardian stated it was heard by someone in the room listening to the phone call in the UK
t1_dt9373e	0	*	America was built upon protest. This is absolutely absurd.
t1_dt91aq9	1	*	Maybe we should start calling him El Presidente
t1_dt8uche	1	*	Fascist confirmed
t1_dt91g8n	0	*	So the potus will only visit a democracy if they suspend democracy......
t1_dt91r5y	1	*	Like if banning the protests is going to do something in 2018, look at Venezuela 
t1_dt8u7t2	1	*	Maggie Thatcher would have reveled in the protests.
t1_dt9kihs	0	*	This is pure speculation by the way. No source, no quotes, nothing to support it.
t1_dt9h41v	1	*	Dear Trump,  GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!  From,  UK citizen 
t1_dt8wkaj	1	*	People are morons for believing this article.  He doesn't ban protests where it's within his actual power to ban them.   Why would he ban them in another country?
t1_dt8z5sx	1	*	Typical bully, he can dish it out but he sure as fuck can't take it. 
t1_dt8t17e	1	*	Coming from a country with free speech this is really... whats the word... dumb.
t1_dt8t176	1	*	See, undermining UK freedoms will give the USA a reason to invade in order to install democracy. The full 180 degrees reversal from colony to coloniser.
t1_dt8v078	1	*	If only we had known it was so simple to get rid of him
t1_dt8wzd8	1	*	If the US protests enough, will he stay away?  He is out of the country presently.
t1_dt8ujcw	1	*	Trump allows protests in the US so I dont see why he would want to beg May to stop protests in their country. I feel like he just wants to stir up controversy.
t1_dt9ut01	1	*	Fuck Trump! This in itself should cause people to protest! Fuck this pathetic man! 
t1_dt8wrwp	1	*	So I guess we're just dropping the obviously fake embassy relocation pretense?
t1_dt8vxpo	1	*	And they call liberals crying little babies...
t1_dt99sge	1	*	She should ban them at first, then go back on her word as soon as he walks in. Barricade him inside and give us the go-signal to take DC. 
t1_dt8u8c0	1	*	Snowflake
t1_dt8u8cx	1	*	If we protest enough, can we get him to not visit the US, either?
t1_dt8x3sy	1	*	I think she should agree just to get him to visit...then have the protests anyway.
t1_dt8qd8h	1	*	Well that's too bad,  said no one.
t1_dt8ryy4	1	*	Not something the leader of the *free* world should want.
t1_dt8u6zc	1	*	He's such a diiiiiick*  *yes I'm capable of nuanced political discourse, but this is the only appropriate reaction to this fucking manchild. Goddamnit. Get off my planet you orange buffoon. 
t1_dt8y17d	1	*	So Teresa May turns to the populace and says, Good news!...
t1_dt9ra4p	1	*	**Snowflake**
t1_dt93afx	1	*	I wouldn't worry. I am sure folks from the shithole countries would love that he pays them a visit.
t1_dt93lgq	1	*	Haha u tell em trump. I feel bad for the normies over there that dont get blessed by his presence.
t1_dt902x0	1	*	The protests in the UK must've been going to be REALLY bad if he went.  Cause he got protests in Davos but that didn't stop him from going.
t1_dt8si0u	1	*	And yet he refuses to leave America despite all the protests telling him to GTFO.  If only the nutbar would be consistent just once...
t1_dt9gmbf	1	*	Trump is being such a thin skin baby
t1_dt8wpuk	1	*	The president is a little bitch. 
t1_dt93he9	1	*	Is that a promise?  -  everyone in the U.K., probably 
t1_dt8xxnd	1	*	If Trump leaves the US, can we get him to promise he won't come back as long as there are protests here?
t1_dt8u7ip	1	*	I'd flat out ban Trump if he asked me to do that. Fuck him. He serves no propose. 
t1_dt8ve71	1	*	But that's suppression of freedom of expression. What a fucktrumpet wankbucket.
t1_dt9p430	1	*	Damn, this mothefucker is priceless!!  Lol

t1_dt8wl5t	0	*	Is there no end to this idiots stupidity?? I never thought I would continue to feel this ashamed to be represented by him and it's only been 1 year! 
t1_dt8uc4m	1	*	The right: Leftists hate free speech  Also the right: We hate free speech
t1_dt9if72	1	*	We should hire our protesters out to other countries. It seems that he's rather scared of us Brits not liking him just got to send us to countries around the world.
t1_dt8ukex	1	*	I cannot wait for Trumps next book The Fourth International Theory
t1_dta11qw	1	*	Donald trump protesting to ban protests...
t1_dt8uewe	1	*	Serious snowflakery
t1_dt8uewg	1	*	HE DOES NOT REPRESENT US, WORLD! Please believe us!!!
t1_dt8slej	0	*	This seems like something Trump would do, but this honestly feels like fake news.
t1_dt8w5fh	1	*	We can add plutocrat to Drumpfs daunting list of qualities.
t1_dt8v6xm	1	*	He cant stand being hated. Trump is a shallow person with an ego and he cant handle people making fun of him
t1_dt8wz01	1	*	If we dont ban protests in America can we get him to leave?
t1_dt8ulp7	1	*	Uh oh, somebody's fee fees hurt!
t1_dt8u4jv	1	*	Coward. 
t1_dt8w62c	1	*	This guy...
t1_dt99hpa	1	*	Like any true authoritarian would... 
t1_dt913n4	1	*	While May can be stupid, she isnt as stupid as Trump. She would never ban protests, but the thought that Trump thinks that is an option at all scares me.
t1_dt8zxra	1	*	lol uwot m8
t1_dtccv6p	1	*	Fake news. I seriously doubt this happened. Sourcessaid this happened...ya right.
t1_dt96k4j	1	*	Aww shucks sorry UK, /s
t1_dt941vr	1	*	Pretty sure Trump said this because he doesn't care to go there lmao
t1_dt91bb0	1	*	This is a terrible news source.
t1_dt90lnj	1	*	The Democracy is strong in Trump...  I bet the dumbass still thinks England is a functioning monarchy and that May is the queen.
t1_dt8ugi5	1	*	HA what a fucking tool
t1_dt8vqbm	1	*	This is a very dangerous vein of conversation - don't let him come if he cannot open his mind to opinions outside of his gaggle of sycophants.
t1_dt9988c	1	*	What a FUCKING SNOWFLAKE
t1_dt8pzc4	1	*	So what? We think he's a f***ing idiot already. All he's doing is proving it.
t1_dt987kf	1	*	So...we have to respect the KKK's freedom of speech, but not anybody else's...right.
t1_dt8z1ro	1	*	What thin orange skin he has. 
t1_dt8yitb	1	*	What a special snowflake
t1_dt9nc6d	1	*	Where do you get this? Thats some horrible reporting. You just make shit up?
t1_dt8zlem	1	*	I feel like safety would be the primary concern in the situation 
t1_dt8uupk	1	*	He's like Kim Jong Un-*lite*.  He just *wants* to be a ruthless dictator, so bad, but democracy keeps getting in his way.
t1_dt8sb66	1	*	Donald Trump is refusing to visit the UK unless Theresa May can ensure that he is not met with protests.  How the fuck does he know that if he doesnt watch tv?
t1_dt8vncx	1	*	If that's how he feels then he should stay away from football players and women. 
t1_dt8vnc9	1	*	Lol! And he likes to call people snow flakes. 
t1_dt93nsh	0	*	Seems like a fair request to me but its drumph so We have to once again show our fake outrage  
t1_dt95xkd	1	*	He doesn't need to visit. Just do business as usual over the phone/emails/whatever. The Queen doesn't want to meet him and it would just cause more issues than good.
t1_dt8vrua	1	*	Keep digging folks. We have to find one cite worthy fact. 
t1_dt8v9qd	1	*	All I am seeing/hearing is Cartman threatening to not go to the Marshes to play video games unless Randy and Sharon make Stan be nice to him and not call him a fatass.
t1_dt8vt2j	1	*	Theresa may probably wishes she could ban protests. 
t1_dt8slie	1	*	He's just making a ridiculous demand so he doesn't have to show up. Like a kid.
t1_dt8upnj	1	*	Trump would ban protests in the 'Land of the Free' if he could. 
t1_dt8w9zs	1	*	Democracy at its finest
t1_dt8t0t2	0	*	We needed a little something extra to sooth the pain of the flawless mental health screening. Thank you Lord.

t1_dt91hdw	1	*	Trump is a fucking snowflake. 
t1_dt9gwt7	1	*	Wait.  So maybe if we keep protesting he will go away?
t1_dt8zpe9	1	*	Dictators ban protests
t1_dt8u01v	1	*	I'm sure they're taking his demand seriously since they don't want him to come anyway
t1_dt8skqz	1	*	What an absurdly stupid thing to request. 
t1_dt8ur3i	1	*	What more of an indication of Trump's character do you need? The only reason he won't try this in the US is he knows it wouldn't fly.
t1_dt8zxjj	1	*	Okay.
t1_dt8u7ra	1	*	This is hilarious.  In a perverse sort of way, I'm going to miss him when he's impeached, indicted and imprisoned.
t1_dt8u7rr	1	*	I predict people donating to Theresa May, and people flocking to the U.K for vacation. 
t1_dt8u4v2	1	*	god i hope she does it, he visits, and the fucking entire country rebels.
t1_dt8xaac	1	*	Who was the last president to have never visited the UK? Was it before airplanes?
t1_dt8z8gi	1	*	This whole thread is incredibly British and I love every bit of it.
t1_dt8yz3y	1	*	Oh what does he give a shit. Not like anyones got a gun to assassinate him , he hasnt usually pussyfooted before , why the sudden pussyfooting? 
t1_dt90u27	1	*	So the protests worked in advance?
t1_dt9nrte	1	*	Is there any chance this is taken out of context and hes looking out for his own safety in a foreign country?  Just looking at different perspectives.
t1_dt94rei	1	*	And Theresa May said Okay, byeeeeeeeee
t1_dt8tmbf	1	*	What a fucking snowflake.
t1_dt8tmbn	1	*	Trump is a shit stain 
t1_dt91qvn	1	*	Lol Reddit is so dense. Why should he even bother going?
t1_dt94jti	1	*	There isnt a source for this. Please stop posting false stories.
t1_dt9s07r	1	*	Who the fuck does he think that he is?
t1_dt98pu5	1	*	This has to be the hottest vid of 18. Wheres the youtube link?????

t1_dt8tsh8	1	*	Does this mean if we protest enough he'll leave America?
t1_dt8yru7	1	*	Good!  The UK does not need a scumbag like him visiting, anyway. 
t1_dt8veto	1	*	I know almost nothing about the UK other than people generally look forward to the next protest. This wont fly.  
t1_dt92ll0	1	*	I very much doubt he said this.  I'm far from a trump fan but what he says about the media being fake is true.  This hits the headlines but tomorrow's retraction won't be anywhere to be seen.
t1_dt8ssed	1	*	How embarrassing he is

t1_dt8t8be	1	*	Honesty, this may be the darkest thing to come out of the administration so far. 
t1_dt8z44s	1	*	Well that was easy enough way to keep trump out I wish he would say the same for the USA

t1_dt8xatu	1	*	Wouldn't that be taking away someone's freedom?
t1_dt8vgv8	1	*	Alternative headline: Trump tells May he won't visit the UK unless she implements authoritarian rule. 
t1_dt8shai	1	*	Guess hes not going to the UK then. 
t1_dt91kys	1	*	ufe0f 
t1_dt8zudd	1	*	Just put a shit ton of sharks in the English Channel. He won't go near the place.  Edit: I made shit ton two words. It's a metric unit.
t1_dt938v4	1	*	LOL what?
t1_dt91n85	1	*	A year ago no one would have believed this possible of an American President. Now theres a new low every day. 
t1_dt8ujpz	1	*	What a pussy
t1_dt8x8ys	1	*	What a thin-skinned, self-serving hypocrite.
t1_dt9b51y	1	*	In this topic, President of country which prides itself on free speech refuses to visit another country unless they ban free speech in case they say something nasty about him.
t1_dt8w2sx	0	*	Oh just Fuck Off Donald.

t1_dt8wpb7	1	*	Please protest him. Loudly.   Signed, An American 
t1_dtjjiuj	1	*	Vettel's comment at the end of the article, what a pig.
t1_duh0y2h	1	*	First Napster, now this?! Lars Ulrich says, Enough is enough already!

t1_dv49zu6	0	*	Not the jeans :(
t1_dv4ff2e	1	*	That's it! I am stocking up on The bourbon and levi's jeans.  I don't care much for the mopeds that Harley Davidsons make, I'm not 50 years.
t1_dv4gfd7	1	*	What exactly did Trump think would happen?   It just feels like this policy had no thought behind it besides pumping up Trump's shrinking base of support. 
t1_dtcz9to	0	*	Farewell, fascist. 
t1_dtd23dw	0	*	Probably the most important flag-bearer of Swedish culture abroad.   A big chunk of the world knows of Scandinavian design, meatballs and Midsommar thanks to him.
t1_dtrdx1l	0	*	Damn, wont be surprised to see a sub 1k bitcoin.
t1_ds3za50	0	*	The US plays the short game 'arms'.  China plays the long game 'infrastructure'.  The long game always wins. 
t1_dtvgrha	1	*	Because it's the stock market. It WILL crash again and investors know that $1 u/tippr
t1_dt8o2k0	0	*	So the Russia investigation was started based on third party information, which directly goes against all conspiracy theories about the democrats starting it.

t1_dsid1hh	1	*	It's gonna be interesting to see how this plays out for him.
t1_dtwot2l	1	*	Is this why trump shut down his voter fraud commission? I can't think of any other reason. 
t1_dtx1ddh	0	*	Before Trump wins  Trump: The elections are rigged!  Media: Silly Trump. The elections are not rigged.  After Trump wins  Media: The elections are rigged!

t1_dtx7zw7	1	*	For the timing these are very convenient news id say..right schiff? Hillary? Comey? Obama?
t1_dtx2ruh	1	*	Russia elected trump. 100 %. Dems don't want civil war / riots so they don't want to push it. Russia would have elected Ronald mc Donald if he ran. 
t1_dtx2j5w	0	*	What do we do about this? Is this worthy of sanctions? Can you declare cyber war? I wouldnt say this is worthy of actual war though
t1_dtwxmee	1	*	And now what? 
t1_dtwyhtr	0	*	So what does this mean for the future? We know it was hacked... but what will be done?
t1_dtwvk06	1	*	Thank God! It's settled. Russia cares. Russia really really cares. 
t1_dtwur5m	1	*	The hackers on the Soros side weren't as good forget about it
t1_dtwp87u	1	*	Well, at this point, they better have. I'm sick of people being upset that Russia guessed some email passwords. All the major players interfere with other countries elections, the US included. 
t1_dtwuwa8	1	*	They said they didn't do it tho  Trump, probably
t1_dtxfhtc	1	*	So what? Will they vote again?

t1_dtxd5m5	1	*	How the machines aren't contented to the internet
t1_dtwvzjk	1	*	Then why hasn't anything been done about this?
t1_dtxmj8c	1	*	Tried to say to everyone, these voting machines have already been hacked in the past, in Venezuela. Nobody cared
t1_dtykes7	1	*	Says official LOL, does attribution mean nothing these days?
t1_dtww4gu	1	*	So... they successfully looked at a tiny amount of voting records? Okay?
t1_dtwyvt1	0	*	Proof, that's what I say. Release the proof lol. Also, it's been proven and covered up that dead people were voting dem .... so what's the issue. 
t1_dtwy9ua	1	*	YAWN, people need to tune into DEFCON more often 
t1_dtx4x5n	1	*	This shit should just be done on an open ledger on the blockchain 
t1_dtx5rcy	1	*	It was clear since the beginning of rumors - Russians expected Trump would be their best friend and step backward from military expansion in Europe
t1_dtx01ke	1	*	Lol, you guys really buy that load of crap? Inconceivable.
t1_dtwva6t	1	*	Duuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh. 
t1_dtwzkf4	1	*	Why are we only just learning about this? Is it because midterms are coming up soon?

t1_dtx66o8	1	*	#\#NeverHerFault
t1_dtwxyuf	1	*	I thought this was already established fact?
t1_dtx7kb9	1	*	Omg big news. 
t1_dtx3v5b	1	*	U.S. cotizens successfully brainwashed into believing democracy is not controlled by money and that they actually select their crusty leaders
t1_dtwvzaa	1	*	Holy shit. Give it a rest you fucking snowflakes. 
t1_dtx40oj	1	*	We need voter ID laws or voter fraud is going to continue. It's also highly suspicious some states refused to hand over their records.
t1_dtx61to	1	*	This should be flagged for misleading title. Article is talking about voter rolls, ie lists of voter info, NOT about voting machines. Im all for paper ballots, but this is not news.
t1_dtx39ma	0	*	To be honest it was probably the CIA. Ever since Vault 7 we've known that they were more than capable and willing to do this sort of stuff.
t1_dtwreno	0	*	Obama said this couldn't happen...
t1_dtww3wk	1	*	Old news is old. This was known in the summer of 2016.

t1_dtx6i6s	0	*	After the previous administration's corruption that's being pulled out into the light, it's fun to watch the grasping at straws. 
t1_dtwxpzf	1	*	Trump for president of Russia.
t1_dtx5eo0	1	*	The comments in this thread are so funny, you can tell Trump has had an especially bad week.  So much rage, look at the little tiny fists shaking!
t1_dtwzazh	1	*	We need to count the provisional ballots, but like a year ago.
t1_dtx5o3z	1	*	So the russians interfered in us ellections just as the usa does with everybody else who is important. Yeah, cry me a river usa.
t1_dtwv9ep	1	*	How do they get knocked back to the stone age?
t1_dtwqd6t	0	*	Bullshit
t1_dtwyoh2	1	*	If only this had been caught before it was too late so that Hillary could have won the popular vote by more than the 2.9 million votes she already won by...
t1_dtwvdrm	1	*	So can we finally charge Trump of treason or impeach him finally?  SERIOUSLY?
t1_dtwvixy	1	*	No indication that they changed anything? And where is this proof that they actually hacked them and why did it take this long to find out? I call bs.
t1_dtx34d0	1	*	Wow, triple threat hack.  Some hackers helped a hack achieve the highest office in a hack country.
t1_dtwwo8z	0	*	Hillary lost. No amount of whining over Russia is gonna change that. It's 2018, get with the program.
t1_dtwvyi6	1	*	So does the U.S. go to war with Russia or does Pence become president?
t1_dtwyjbz	1	*	Gotta watch out for those crazyrussianhackers man
t1_dtx6891	1	*	Please rerun the election. I would happily vote again.
t1_dtwyfvn	1	*	States don't carry master role lists. Its individual districts that do. They aren't standardized either. 
t1_dtxgax0	1	*	Still don't understand why vote counting machines have to be networked, and therefor vulnerable to hacking.
t1_dtwujlx	1	*	Is there anyway we could adapt blockchain for voting integrity purposes?
t1_dtx4ekr	1	*	Now I see how Trump won the public election 
t1_dtwwo2y	1	*	There is no evidence they were altered.. great who cares
t1_dtwv7iu	1	*	Our elections are only as good as the people working at the polls.
t1_dtxjqcm	1	*	they need to give this story a rest
t1_dtww0so	1	*	Welcome to Cold War part 2. Because everyone loves being paranoid and will eat up conspiracy theories like there is no tomorrow. The world needs to spend less time on the internet.
t1_dtwvk9j	1	*	Why dont we just use a scantron like in high school thats not connected to the internet, and implement voter ID. Seems like any doubts will vanish soon after those 2 are implemented 
t1_dtwgqib	0	*	Official also says that bees are responsible for climate change.  Could this be Putin's master plan?
t1_dtwjz1w	1	*	In America, the Russian state votes for you.
t1_dtwpxwe	1	*	Thats so 2016
t1_dtx084h	1	*	Can't hack paper ballots. My only question: if the Russians got in, who else has/can? 
t1_dtx2iej	1	*	Can someone explain to me like Im five the benefit of doing this would be? 
t1_dtwvt28	1	*	Well us tin foil hats have been saying electronic voting is a poor idea (hacking being one of the reasons why), for a long, long time.
t1_dtx12ar	1	*	Now that the memo has been released, I have not seen saltier people in my life! Reddit & NBS are just the worst!
t1_dtx1fpz	1	*	This is why we need https://horizonstate.com
t1_dtx93s3	1	*	Bigger picture - US, Russia and China have been in a non stop triple threat cyber war for the entire modern era.   
t1_dtwxtug	1	*	Mad skills!Bravo!
t1_dtwyfhm	1	*	So we're going to stop using the known hackable now been hacked machines right? 
t1_dtx2dgz	1	*	FAKE NEWS.  [Obama told us so.](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/19/politics/election-day-russia-hacking-explained/index.html)
t1_dtwyat2	1	*	Dems are getting pretty desperate now, lol. Gotta keep this narrative alive at all costs!  Hey Putin if you're reading this, I'll gladly accept my care package. You can send me another one in 2020.
t1_dtwpphr	1	*	So they hacked into our system before the election, and the Obama administration failed to stop them? Sounds almost like they colluded with the Russians...
t1_dtwzwtu	1	*	Its time to use the old paper and pen for voting 
t1_dtwyqmg	1	*	I call bs but I'm. 
t1_dtx4vyh	1	*	Who are those Russians? Those two drunks I see in front of the drugstore every day? Maybe that Russian student that came to America to finish the masters? WHAT RUSSIANS?!  Murica went full retard.

t1_dtwzbc4	1	*	NOW all of a sudden liberals want voter ID lmao, k 
t1_dtwwd7a	1	*	I'd wager that if the folks at Defcon are able to do it, so are the Russians.
t1_dtwvhzx	1	*	Russia sure loves to hack just look at their CSGO teams that are suddenly really good this past year. 
t1_dtwwmal	1	*	I still wonder why the whole thing is not considered an act of war. This is cyber warfare. When will Americans wake up?
t1_dtwunq4	0	*	I don't get why they would be accessable over the internet anyway
t1_dtwvx8z	1	*	Yeah they did it for Hillary. Thats the funny part. U0001f923
t1_dtwwr9e	1	*	Yes, and?
t1_duya68l	1	*	Iran may have come up, but he called to sell them nuclear plants. He owed General Flynn an old favor.
t1_dtdk0w2	1	*	Its not like we didn't already know there was a super continent or anything. 
t1_dtd0v9i	1	*	I think we should recreate this continent. All the Aussies and all the Canadians will start paddling. We'll meet up where Hawaii is and send it to Antarctica. 
t1_dtdoz7i	1	*	Does that mean we can travel to that rock and not need passports???? ^^^^pls ^^^^australia
t1_dtd8zat	1	*	*cough* Pangea *cough*

t1_dte2v4m	1	*	If it's billions of years old, how is it Canadian? 
t1_dteiwtz	1	*	I was expecting like a corner of land with a couple maple trees and a ranger on a moose doing circles there

t1_dud0gj5	1	*	American tweeters must be getting more stupid. The reduced price of $1000/millions tweeters is dirt cheap to influence their opinions.
t1_ducwc3p	1	*	LMAO. Most re tweeted one was like 1200 re tweets. Probably other bots as well. This is so weak.

t1_ducrde1	1	*	Continue running this narrative and the lefties of Reddit will be happy when war with Russia comes.
t1_ducrx8j	1	*	We live in the dumbest society. The liberals bash the conservatives. The conservatives bash the liberals...blah blah blah 
t1_ducoq2u	1	*	 Is there someone out there willing to aggregate these things into a concise list that's easy to browse especially through a mobile platform?   thank you in advance.
t1_dud5ail	1	*	Now publish the thousands of messages between Stzrok and Page
t1_ducv4i1	1	*	Is there always this amount of r/conspiracy and shill/bot calling around here? Its hard to find any comments talking about the entire picture :/
t1_dud0l0d	1	*	We let them divide our country into deeper shades of red, blue, black, and white in the tiniest span of time. Keeps shit unorganized at the bottom so nothing can change up top I guess.
t1_ducqg54	0	*	This viewership brought to you and funded by...
t1_dud3qt3	1	*	How is this still a thing?
t1_dud115z	1	*	Ive seen this before.  I wish theyd publish the tweets in context with font and photos, but maybe thats impossible now that Twitter has deleted them.

t1_dt0dbv7	0	*	This will hurt, as we all know that the Germans make the best weapons.
t1_dt0k3uw	1	*	About time.  It's amazing that our armaments businesses keep arming nations and then we wonder why we dont have peace in the world
t1_dt0ru08	1	*	This is good for UK exports!
t1_dt110ah	0	*	Why were they selling to Saudi Arabia anyway? If you want to stop radical Islam maybe stop giving money and weapons to a radical Muslim monarchy
t1_dt12pgx	1	*	Could they maybe stop importing? Germany is so fucked.
t1_dt0kbb4	1	*	Good on you Germany, that's one step in the right direction.
t1_dt0to1m	1	*	Humm, I wonder if US arms production can cover the gap.  I'm inclined to believe they can.
t1_dt0m4yh	1	*	America participates in the war in Yemen...
t1_dt0mbhp	1	*	German here. Ignore those announcements. They are hollow. We make too much money by selling military stuff to bad regions.
t1_dt0w49c	1	*	Words that hold no weight and affect nothing. Wherever there is a want/need for armaments there will be ways to supply them. 
t1_dt0qqp9	1	*	Stopped supplying Saudi Arabia but started supplying Turkey. So by proxy they didn't do anything. Just other group will suffer.
t1_dt0gr9v	0	*	How DARE they use the weapons we are selling them??
t1_dt15co3	1	*	A little late?
t1_dt0ojcm	1	*	So Germany claims moral high ground, and US gets billions more. Win/win
t1_dt0hn22	1	*	Lol well I guess the US will be get more money out of this on the bright side. 
t1_dt0viwr	1	*	So basically they will sell them to the United States and then the United States will sell them to Saudi Arabia? 
t1_dt0ifms	0	*	they are still selling weapons to turkey tho.

t1_dt0hvao	0	*	Good move, and brave one of the government. Could potentially result in backlash from Saudi Arabia.
t1_dt0i6tx	1	*	Now they promise germany will only secretly sell weapons to a third party that will secretly sell weapons to saudi arabia. See i mean technically theyre not lying
t1_dt0dnio	0	*	I'm not sure that I understand this correctly. Is this just because of political talks and a deal being made or is this actually because of a moral stand?
t1_dt0lc7u	1	*	Keep selling the last ones out we got 'til Friday boys
t1_dt0mzb5	1	*	Oh but other wars are OK.  Fuck outta here Germany

t1_dt0jl1s	1	*	I wouldn't be surprised if there are terror attacks which point towards Yemen in Germany now.
t1_dt0r58l	1	*	That's OK, I'm sure the U.S. will step in to pick up the slack
t1_dt0ie7a	1	*	More money for Britain, then :)
t1_dt0qe69	0	*	US should do the same
t1_dt0qb9u	1	*	Saudi Arabia - what every right-wing, fundamentalist bunch of looneys in the middle-east (like ISIS) wants to be when they grow up.
t1_dt0wlxu	0	*	Does this mean a bigger share of the Saudi missile and bomb market for Lockheed Martin? The US will never stop selling weapons, because jobs AKA war profiteering.
t1_dt12pma	1	*	Kind of beats the purpose of selling weapons..
t1_dt0kvj4	1	*	Does that mean they wont sell to the US anymore?
t1_dt0aqyg	0	*	Not sure how much of a difference it would make.
t1_dt2dy2u	1	*	Just now, Saudi is giving 1.5 billion dollars to Yemen to help with hunger, medical facilities, and the entire crisis. Check the news.
t1_dt0idjf	1	*	its a little late for that
t1_dt1qoir	1	*	As if Germany wouldnt be involved if there was a violent war in Poland or France. Its on Saudi Arabias doorstep. Why should they not be involved? 
t1_dt0h44z	0	*	meanwhile Norway just recently voted down this proposal in parliament  how embarrassing. 
t1_dt16vjz	0	*	Funny how it is immediately when the US just bought thousands of your rifles.  But also thanks for the dope ass rifles, Germany.

t1_dscjid7	1	*	So theyre gonna bring him back? That makes sense 
t1_dsqys41	0	*	It would be prudent to transition entirely to nuclear, hydro, solar and wind. Keep that garbage gas in the depths where it belongs.
t1_dsqucpy	0	*	What was that? I couldn't hear you over all the fracking we're doing.
t1_ds6ivov	0	*	I'm honestly surprised they were allowed there in the first place. I would assume that a lot of classified official business takes place over there and would need to be compliant as a SCIF.
t1_du3avd8	1	*	Hasn't it always? I remember seeing a documentary in the 90s about these people drinking cow urine as some kind of health practice.
t1_du3h4gi	1	*	What will the branding look like?  > Sunny P

t1_dto2cvh	1	*	If I were him I'd go to a remote island and stay there ... wait.
t1_dtnv8n0	0	*	If police can get away with this argument, why can't he.  He said that he feared for his life, give him a few weeks paid vacation and modified duty.
t1_dto2cky	1	*	I like to imagine that the missile threat was real and some crazy secret military whatevers neutralized the threat.

t1_dsa7tp0	0	*	Hmmmm. Balance that statement with the obscenely rich Vatican and it appears the guy in the silly hat is way out of touch.

t1_duv7ovr	1	*	Putting their own predatory spin on we got you fam.
t1_duwbtdf	1	*	My government spent considerable amounts of tax money to support this organization. And Oxfam was always quick to look down on us from their moral high ground. Arrogant pricks deserve to go down.
t1_dtcewsv	1	*	that's not good. This is one of the engineering grand challenges we are facing.

t1_dtrgjmd	1	*	Is there stat for Reddit usage as well?
t1_dtrftfy	1	*	This is what happens when you get greedy and go public. It turns into a chase for more and more money for the stock holders and ignores the people who actually use it.

t1_dtra8dj	1	*	I never got into Facebook, but I also don't think it's a terrible site. Seems convenient 
t1_dtrbnsu	1	*	Mark looks super bummed out in that picture.
t1_dtrg1g4	1	*	The blue Myspace?

t1_dtrpln0	1	*	That's because facebook is lame once your whole family is on it. Anonymity is why the internet exists.

t1_dtrgvsi	1	*	Reddit is my Facebook now. I bet Zuckerberg doesn't even use Facebook anymore.

t1_dtwvgrb	1	*	I think they were probably more middle eastern looking.  People were in the middle east around Turkey and Iran for a long time during the ice age before moving into Europe.  
t1_dtw6e2y	1	*	I find it very interesting how skin can change in such a short time period. But then again 100k years ago we were all black...

t1_duwsgxt	0	*	Most of the work force in Quebec earn 50 000$ per years and less... For a doctor its now 400 000$ per years. I just wanted to add this fact.
t1_duwlv1k	0	*	Good that Doctors in Quebec are fighting against the privatization of our healthcare system.  Fuck you, Cuillard. 
t1_dwk2nn0	1	*	That's news... Unfortunately,Quebec has a total of 19,808 doctors actively working right now. 1% of the populace may not sway the decision on the pay rise.

t1_dux4fy4	1	*	Bring on the AI robot doctors! Then we can help these human doctors not have to worry about their salaries so much anymore.
t1_duwnowk	0	*	Why is this interesting? 200 is such a small number. Probably less than 1% of Quebec doctors. I can get 1% of any sufficiently large group to agree to just about anything.
t1_duwxda5	0	*	250 out of 20,000 doctors. This isn't a news story.

t1_du6s50m	0	*	So many salty American'ts in this thread.
t1_du6y34g	1	*	That's the big difference between a democracy with rule of law, and a centralized dictatorship.  China can centrally plan and execute takeovers of entire global industries. 
t1_du6jswd	0	*	Same thing happened with United States real estate in the late 80's. It will be ok. Chinese investors like to make money like everyone else. 
t1_du6w3au	0	*	China is also taking over Africa.  After the fall of the West caused by liberal commies China will be the sole superpower left in the world.

t1_dud2ph8	0	*	What is the chance these people be brought to justice? We cannot go to Russia to arrest them. It is more effective to retaliate against Russian government rather than targeting these individuals.

t1_du9bfhu	1	*	Classic stitch up 
t1_du8q608	1	*	Call me cynic or what not, but it's just for removing potential oppositions and improving the image of himself (and the party). Those who pick the right side would still corrupt freely.

t1_du92072	1	*	Could use a little of this in the US but FREEDOM!!
t1_du8u3hm	1	*	That's the one that is the equivalent to the one Trump will be dumped into.  Lawn bowling, 3 massages per week, un-escorted day passes to the hotel of their choosing.
t1_dua6yzh	1	*	So do we know this is an actual corruption crack down? Because locking over a million government officials in gulags sounds like a Stalinist purge from where I'm standing. 
t1_du9191j	1	*	The chinese can  build 10 of those elite prisons in a month if they want.   Nothing to worry here.
t1_du9hk69	1	*	Does china have a jury system? Hmm.

t1_du6oyto	0	*	Trump was supposed to fulfill his campaign promises, not Clintons. She wanted to topple Assad after all.  Maybe he should spend less time golfing and more time doing his job.
t1_du725we	1	*	Sucks as a soldier to die like that. All of the sudden you are bombed out of nowhere and instantly 200 of your comrades are wiped out. No chance to fight back.  RIP Mercenaries.

t1_du8hvco	1	*	In a fight against Russian operators, they might be able to swing good air cover. So put a few Raptors in the air in case an Su-35 just happens to be in the area. It prevents accidents.  
t1_du6zhlx	0	*	This would have been cleared with the Russians. Like many things US does in Syria. Russia would never order it's troops to attack us positions and vice versa.
t1_du7ychj	1	*	Russian mercenaries killed during a rogue attack on a US held position  Fixed the headline for you.

t1_dt2067q	0	*	That means rest 99% of the world's population earned just 18% of the wealth generated in 2017. :(
t1_dt1jilb	1	*	Greed writes the Laws that govern our economy. 
t1_dt1i95j	1	*	Anyone know hte methodology they used to get their data?
t1_dt1rvx7	1	*	They must do 82% of everything. Good going!
t1_dt25esl	1	*	TIL: Billions are bigger than thousands
t1_dt1t1mx	1	*	...And 99 percent of shark attacks happen in shallow waters.
t1_dt3vvu2	1	*	Just like an out of control malignant cancer, growing until it consumes all resources.
t1_dt23zht	1	*	With proper pareto distribution, the numbers should be that the top 20% are making 80% of the money. Adam Smith is rolling in his grave. 
t1_dt284ql	1	*	Maybe I am mistaken, but a quick search of **world's** top 1% is about is about $32k a year... So... 
t1_dt26doc	1	*	Just a notice that the world's top 1% is something around $37k/year last I heard. So it's not just the millionaires and billionaires.
t1_dt1vo88	1	*	Don't they deserve it for working hard though?
t1_dt1s4a0	1	*	Watch out for the shill users saying that all American are in the 1%.
t1_dt1z25u	0	*	We'll only somehow end up giving them the remaining 18% in the next decade. GG capitalism.
t1_dt41un9	1	*	Not surprising. Wealth can earn more wealth faster than a worker can earn wealth via productive working.  If you think it is bad now wait for automation and/good AI comes in. 
t1_dt1p7rf	1	*	This is why Usury must be banned.
t1_dt1tk6u	0	*	Here's a question - how much of that 82 percent went to the global 0.1% or 0.01%? Also, I wonder if there's a way to put this in purchasing power context.

t1_dt23q15	1	*	Pretty unzipfy.
t1_dt25akq	1	*	And the worst thing is they lock all that money up in a huge vault for Scrooge McDuck to jump around in!

t1_dt242ir	1	*	Oh no! That guy provided too many goods and services! Go take his stuff!
t1_dt2akej	1	*	It would be odd if the people that have the majority of wealth didn't also generate the majority of new wealth. 
t1_dt28yfs	0	*	So now that it's made news on the front page under two different sub-Reddits can we do something about it? Or just talk about how awesome the elephant in the room is. 
t1_dt36n7j	1	*	I would expect the top 1% to earn 99% of the wealth. So this seems progressive. 
t1_dt3ivpf	1	*	And if we tighten our belts, and give the 1% just a little bit more, then soon enough the trickle down will rain down on us like a mighty thunderstorm.  I can't wait for it!

t1_ds5pii0	1	*	Somebody to say it
t1_ds5kzwn	1	*	Between 0 and 1 for OWS.  And Ferguson destroyed themselves, so...
t1_ds4t3an	1	*	That's weird cause I'm pretty sure you can use all of the internet here...but what do I know, I'm so oppressed 
t1_ds52tgo	1	*	Whataboutism
t1_ds4wzfv	1	*	We need the entire world to coordinate and simultaneously open this YouTube video at the same moment...especially Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2sd6P2Tu8rw
t1_ds4oqo5	1	*	I don't think this piece of weak sauce propaganda was cooked up by their A team.

t1_ds5d6jt	1	*	Russia sucks
t1_ds4u2cp	1	*	Funny how Russia has the temerity to think they can tell us what to do now. Guess that stems from having their cheeto in the White House.  
t1_ds5ch8x	1	*	Occupy Wall Street just kind of faded away, and Ferguson was just a couple of riots that ended on their own too.  Why is Russia going full  The Real Housewives of Atlanta on every other nation?
t1_ds4tvpy	0	*	we bent over backwards for the occupiers until their ADD kicked in and they got bored and cold and went home.   Nice try Putie-pants.

t1_ds4o3iy	1	*	They're right tho.
t1_ds574ej	1	*	Well, several U. S. states have been proposing laws to make it legal for cars to run down protestors.  Odd how that tune changes when the protest is against somebody else.
t1_ds51mi0	1	*	I can criticize, and I shall
t1_ds4wssc	1	*	Russia is facetious as all hell. 
t1_ds5qnu9	1	*	Fuck Drumpf, he killed Occupy Wall Street. He killed Ferguson! Oh, that wasn't him? Well fuck Drumpf!

t1_ds4ympb	1	*	The notion that a country  as a whole says anything is kind of absurd  
t1_ds5126i	1	*	How about we criticize all states that crush protest?  
t1_ds4ooez	1	*	Did it? Sure the movements died out but it wasn't because they were crushed in any way iirc.
t1_ds5192e	1	*	This makes them sound stupid to anyone familiar with the events of Ferguson and OWS. 
t1_ds4p4wu	1	*	I don't even think the shills will be able to eat this one up
t1_ds4pr2e	1	*	The world needs to stop caring about what Russia says and more about what they do.  
t1_ds4rkdr	1	*	Can we talk about COINTELPRO? Cause that was some serious bullshit.
t1_ds4y1x9	0	*	The reason Russia knows about OWS and Ferguson is precisely because the US didn't do what Russia's claiming they did.
t1_ds4q6zn	1	*	wo what is it? are you guys against or for russia? jesus crist...
t1_ds5mic1	1	*	How many deaths were associated with Occupy Wall Street? Oh..ya...

t1_ds56zbs	1	*	Russia can STFU.
t1_ds4xjhy	1	*	The country that has murdered more of their own population that literally....everyone... if we're going to pull this eye for an eye  stuff...Russia needs to start shutting the hell right up

t1_ds4t7qx	1	*	Shots fired!

t1_ds503h0	1	*	Well.. Russia certainly has no room to talk at all but I mean they're not... Like... Entirely wrong.
t1_ds4ojgj	1	*	Russia forgot to mention the DAPL protests.
t1_ds4uv7n	1	*	Because some kids in tents just having to be part of some flavour of the month protest is exactly the same anything that's been happening in the middle east. Well done Putin, well done. *slow clap*
t1_ds4wkry	1	*	The nation who won't let opposition run against him 
t1_ds4oiri	1	*	Russia just likes to talk so they can still seem like a super power.  when in reality their economy by gdp is 12th... Right behind Canada and South korea
t1_ds54cfl	1	*	Its funny watching white America act as if this protest is due to oppression and not simply inflation caused by the last guy.  Fuck White America so hard lol

t1_dsu3e8v	1	*	Somone force multiplay those fuckers with cubans on raft building ops. I haven't seen one sail yet. I assume the ghetto rigged 5 hp motor is probably pretty unlikely.
t1_dsuz4zn	1	*	Anyone know why these ships are *always* reported to be full of dead people? Surely someone has to be alive if people are taking them with the intention of fleeing to another country.

t1_dsb3qy2	0	*	Lets make a fucking deal. Federally legalize marijuana and use the taxes to pay for your fucking wall. Once the wall is paid for make all tax funds go towards education.

t1_duzq73k	1	*	Yes please. Lets not lag behind on modern policies that may actually help citizens due to our southern neighbours spewing lies nonstop.

t1_dscnpqv	1	*	If The scale & extend of the entire exercise was far greater than officially stated is the most sensational title they can come up with then this must really be some boring commonplace event. 
t1_dsd3pwv	1	*	Did they win?   I often simulate having sex with some hot celebrity. 10/10
t1_dscfc7s	1	*	Could Russia actually be able to stave off NATO in total war? They dont really have a lot of reliable allies. China wouldnt do shit. They could use North Korea... but thats about it?

t1_duzxfqx	1	*	Apparently they want to outdo Zimbabwe.  
t1_dv07fq7	1	*	Their officials must have watched Black Panther. Let's see how their Wakanda turns out.
t1_duzx7az	0	*	The Daily Mail is a trash source. I've been googling around and only finding fringe stuff on this.  Any one know a good source?
t1_duzzvbx	1	*	Are there any South Africans out there who would like to explain this to me more objectively than a Daily Mail article can? Any help is appreciated.

t1_dv01esf	1	*	I'm sure they plan to distribute the land equitably among the people and not just hand it to their political cronies. Wouldn't want to give the continent a bad name.
t1_dv00q6c	1	*	Seems like systemic racism to me.

t1_dv042d4	1	*	Tolerance working out really well once again!

t1_duzzzjr	1	*	Enjoy your famine
t1_dv06mjm	1	*	I always wondered why people are in such a rush to become farmers considering how they get treated by society.  I mean, I wouldnt take that land considering how they got it from the last guy.
t1_dv03fuw	0	*	As an aside, I want to go to South Africa on a holiday. Is it worth taking 2,000 Million Rand with me in a small dump truck, or should I just take $50 with me and change it as I go?

t1_duzzfg8	1	*	Shithole

t1_dv02msd	0	*	Last I heard they gave those land back to white farmers again.
t1_dv05blg	1	*	South African lands are shallow, not very fertile and dry. Farmers do a miracle there, extracting food from a soil that farmers in Brazil or US would consider improper to crops and pastures.
t1_dv065sh	1	*	Okay... so they take the land... Then what? Vague mentions of redistribution are mentioned. Id love to see how they plan to fairly implement that...

t1_duzymea	1	*	Ahhh communism, at it again huh. 
t1_dv04f37	1	*	Its not like theyre torching and salting the land. Taking it away from the colonizers and reallocating the land is as measured a first step as any.

t1_dt7lzyq	1	*	Im concerned about whether a socialist utopia like DPRK could handle reunification with a capitalist hellscape like South Korea.
t1_dt7iyt3	0	*	I thought North and South Korea have marched before under a unified flag..
t1_dt7jst8	1	*	When haven't they called for reunification? That was the whole point of the Korean war.

t1_dt77796	1	*	North Korea asks for unconditional surrender of South Korean government. Fify
t1_dt7efu6	0	*	Souths Korea should push for democracy as much as they can. Also to send Kim Jong Un to Switzerland or somewhere he can eat all the chocolate he wants.
t1_dt8zjy4	1	*	I like how reddit's photo of this is a confused alien...we all are reddit, we all are...
t1_dt7dacq	1	*	No bamboozle?

t1_dt7nz2z	1	*	I dunno about you guys but I really think there are some hidden motives in this.

t1_dt7f501	1	*	Wat
t1_dt7kgh1	1	*	trump baby yeah
t1_dt7926e	1	*	AFAIK that's what they always wanted. Their plan is that they reunite and then take over, isn't it? 
t1_dt793fi	1	*	What a shit, misleading title.
t1_dt7cren	1	*	With only the small catch of Korea being united under him 
t1_dt7mzga	1	*	Omg Homefront comes to life
t1_dt7fxvy	1	*	Itt:      Trump supporters: look at our god emporer! He is the greatest negotiator ever!      Reasonable people: didn't this happen in 2012? And 2000? Wasn't this solely between nk and sk? 
t1_dt7ban7	1	*	Sure. Have fun kids. 
t1_dt796z4	1	*	.... As long as Kim remains the head of state.. 
t1_dt78spk	0	*	I feel like this may be some sort of a bait. Like its great they want reunification but they went from hate to love real quick.
t1_dt79emy	1	*	As long as Kim is running the show right? 
t1_dt7c7av	1	*	Thanks president Donald Trump!
t1_dt79bxg	1	*	like the kid with raisins saying HEY LET'S ALL SHARE OUR CANDY TOGETHER! I KNOW GREAT IDEA, RIGHT?!
t1_dt8j70s	1	*	He is just buying time..
t1_dt7a8ct	1	*	Okay then
t1_dt7dosf	1	*	If they resolve all issues I guarantee Trump will boast and try to take credit for it.
t1_dt7a2k4	1	*	wtf  are we certain the CIA did not assassinate Kim and replaced him?
t1_dt7s9j5	1	*	I think curricula should include histories of Native Americans based on the evidence we have along with perspectives from living Native people. I should have left it at that. 
t1_dt7ejk7	1	*	What the fuck? Kim made some god damn New Years resolutions 
t1_dt7emex	1	*	Well, I give Kim Jung-un 90 days to live.
t1_dthic9n	1	*	Top kek 
t1_dt7o12r	1	*	President Trump scared the fuck outta Rocketman, Rocketman, in desperate fear, decides to seek unification with SK in hopes of saving his sorry ass. 
t1_dt7aifz	1	*	uh, we'll reunify but you're not allowed to be in charge of literally any aspect of anything, like bitch you been killing people -South Korea reportedly said
t1_dt7t5ya	0	*	My former neighbors adopted two children from South  Korea.  There is no real animus towards the north, and people desire reunification   Once the Kim cabal goes away there is hope it will happen 
t1_dt7fb1d	1	*	You mean North Korea wants to peacefully take over South Korea without any other countries interference and place them under Kim Jong Un/North Korea regime.
t1_dt7jed8	1	*	Hi I am now part of a historical archive. Study well for your history test future students! 
t1_dt79ugm	1	*	And do what? muder south koreans? I dont see him giving up power to reunify
t1_dt79ugj	1	*	This guy!
t1_dt7mgka	1	*	Lol. This what South Korea did they lold 
t1_dt7hyrt	1	*	kim jong un has even graciously offered his services as emperor-for-life for the re-unified korea.
t1_dt7ek85	1	*	He's a pussy bitch
t1_dt7e5zh	1	*	Obviously they sensed US attack, so they are suddenly doing Olympics and reunification to buy time
t1_dt7gtag	0	*	If Kim were to basically surrender his nation wouldnt he be able to cut a deal that pardons him on all his war crimes and gives him a house on the beach somewhere?
t1_dt7b2pw	1	*	What you playin at North Korea? 
t1_dte6u2b	1	*	That was kind of a mass death.
t1_dt7qrd0	1	*	You give in for a coffee date and now they want to get married.
t1_dt7ru8b	1	*	Who does this guy think he is lol
t1_dt7syup	1	*	Perhaps he thinks they've tried everything else, and maybe asking will work?
t1_dt6wzix	1	*	Wait. Is this a ruse?
t1_dt7cq3w	1	*	Which they've been wanting since North Korea became a state. The issue isn't reunification, it's the terms by which they do so. 
t1_dt6w6vk	0	*	When it makes absolutely no sense from a foreign policy standpoint the reason is domestic policy. Probably just some quick propaganda points. 
t1_dt7bkcp	1	*	Is this real cause I can't find it on any other site?
t1_dt7bkcy	1	*	The North is doing this now so that when Trump inevitably fucks up the peace process with his ego they can say well we tried and go back to their nuke program.
t1_dt7bdob	1	*	Not happening. Kim wouldn't allow it unless he is in charge and South Korea won't let that happen. 
t1_dt7qpbf	1	*	Mother fucker broke 
t1_dt7fi01	1	*	I better get the fuck out of here. N.K will backstab S.K like they have throughout the history.  
t1_dt7e06h	1	*	After he received a personal phone call from Trump, he calls South Korea, wanting to hide behind the curtain of reunification.   I did a terrible thing! Please save me! Hide me! 
t1_dt7kxr7	1	*	Ive played Homefront... and I dont like where this is going.
t1_dt70nal	1	*	This is either Peace Medals before Pearl Harbour or the biggest political U-turn of the century.
t1_dt7fju9	1	*	Naw, fuck out of here with that. 
t1_dt7l8ct	1	*	I hope this  can happen. Same people, same culture, same language, separated by 60 years of politics.
t1_dt7avxq	1	*	The ball's in YOUR court South Korea... make the right choice.  Haha, but really this is just crazy.
t1_dt6ybve	1	*	Its a trap!  https://www.google.com/search?q=its+a.trap.gif&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari#imgrc=zMkszL8beZsnhM:

t1_dt7etjx	1	*	Oh word?
t1_dt7996n	1	*	So... Kim surrendered? Thats awesome!
t1_dt7bk75	1	*	Are yall still talking about North Korea? Clearly it was a scare tactic created by the US dicktakership. 
t1_dt7a3oc	1	*	fuck it. bring on the nukes.
t1_dt703sh	0	*	Can anyone comment on whether this is just another generic political power move or if this is actual proper steps in the right direction.
t1_dt7chbs	1	*	Reunification so long as the Kim family is in charge. Not buying.
t1_dt789on	1	*	This is one of the worst articles I have ever read. Bla bla bla. trump said this stupid thing. End of article. 
t1_dt7q7j5	1	*	USA reunified with Iraq without consent. It happens
t1_dt7b53n	1	*	Oh, thats nice of him. Itll be cool to see them back together again.  /s
t1_dt7bys5	1	*	Is this like when one of the parents argue that they should stay together for the sake of the child, despite hating each other?
t1_dt7qf1n	1	*	That's the whole reason Korean war happened...
t1_dt7kkgm	1	*	I'm half North Korean born and raised in America and I would love to see anything change for the better for the people of North Korea.  I hope this isn't a fluke.
t1_dt7by27	1	*	North: it's the olympics, let's march under one flag and put our teams together. South: Ok :) North: let's reunite! South: oh hell naw. North: it was worth a shot.
t1_dt7la56	1	*	How do you fall for this, they obviously just want to reunify under their own government. Click bait title and total bs. I bet people didn't read the article. 
t1_dt79z4r	1	*	Oh geez, guess who will take credit if that ever happens?
t1_dt78qb4	1	*	I hope nothing really bad happens during the Olympics next month in SK. 
t1_dt7sh8c	1	*	Im curious about the Olympic athletes. Whats going to keep them from defecting? I wonder if the government is holding their families hostage or something like that
t1_dt7rx4v	1	*	Korean hockey
t1_dt7oe2j	1	*	And that's why you don't want to judge too soon.
t1_dt70ghb	0	*	well, it's a step forward. better than talk of nuclear missile attacks
t1_dt7vzxp	1	*	What they mean is annexation.
t1_dt7bf87	1	*	Its a trap
t1_dt7gfls	1	*	trump 2020
t1_dt7cgs6	1	*	Wow you can really buy a lot of upvotes as a nation
t1_dt7pkh4	1	*	My question is unification under what terms?
t1_dt7jawb	1	*	His head is square...
t1_dt7hbl2	1	*	Let me guess. He wants to rule? The thing that no South Korean wants?  He may as well ask the United States and the UK to swear allegiance as well. Then tell Saudi Arabia he now owns their oil. 
t1_dt76vkf	1	*	Kim Jong is just really lonely D:
t1_dt78lie	1	*	The article actually makes it sound like he wants to peacefully reunify through negotiations, which is strange to me. Of course save for the smash comment.
t1_dt7cit7	1	*	Sick of eating Grass are they?
t1_dt7d21i	1	*	So they built nukes and now they're submitting to essentially becoming over ran politically and culturally from South Korea?
t1_dt7o9pv	1	*	We are at a stage in time where even North Korea sounds more sane and sensible that what comes from the USA. 
t1_dt7avzp	1	*	> North Korea has called on all Koreans at home and abroad to promote contact (and) cooperation between North and South Korea.  aaaaand summary execution for having a smuggled cell phone.
t1_dt7n4e0	1	*	Wait... what? Lmao 
t1_dt7fklu	1	*	China will only support this in exchange for taiwan.
t1_dt7fklr	1	*	It's not really unification if you still want to be in power.   
t1_dt7mkag	1	*	That is great. I hope they find peace.
t1_dt7c38l	1	*	How is Donald going to rationalise his tactical nuclear strike now?
t1_dt7i8ev	1	*	Prediction: North Korea is getting ready for war. They want to give South Korea a chance to hop on board with them before shit gets real.   For the record, I hope I'm wrong. 
t1_dt79bis	1	*	Why are there seven identical microphones? 
t1_dt7gou8	1	*	He does have a sick flattop. 
t1_dt7ngj2	1	*	Huh. I wonder how that would go...
t1_dt775sl	1	*	South Korea is definitely not going to go for this as long as Kims around lol
t1_dt7jixx	1	*	It's a trap!
t1_dt78qgv	1	*	Even if hes open to democratic elections it will be rigged so he wins. If he doesnt win then he probably wont be open to it anymore. 
t1_dt7k33d	1	*	Please do... if it means peace...
t1_dt7immj	1	*	uac00uc988uc544
t1_dt7il57	1	*	Thanks Trump.
t1_dt7cgj7	1	*	New year new me   -Kim
t1_dt7by78	1	*	Let me guess.....Kim Jong Un wants to be the leader of this unified Korea? SK, unification sounds nice but Kim has done nothing to deserve being believed that his intentions are genuine.
t1_dt7bojj	1	*	Has anyone here played Homefront or watched the new Red Dawn?
t1_dt7atir	1	*	Nothing new about this, its been official policy for both governments since the armistice
t1_dt7b6tj	1	*	Good. Truth be told but the north is misunderstood by the world and Dennis Rodman knows Kim better than anyone in the US.  
t1_dt7gk65	1	*	Reunification just means Steal South Korea and hold them as prisoners right?
t1_dt7aeys	1	*	**The North's official news agency said military tension on the Korean peninsula was a fundamental obstacle to the improvement of inter-Korean relations.**                  Ya don't fucking say????
t1_dt7g1x6	1	*	so uh, i'm gonna rule you too. you don't really get that much of a choice. see you soon!
t1_dt8a4mr	1	*	If it's one thing I have learned from anything involving North Korea it's that no one should be suprised by anything they do. Because it's all not surprising
t1_dt7q930	1	*	He's up to something... :/
t1_dt7bpvu	1	*	ITS A TRAP!!!

t1_dt7a0yf	1	*	People have been trying to unite Korea for decades. Trump tells them he will nuke them if they don;t fuck off and NK folds. 
t1_dt7dn2e	1	*	Well then. That's... interesting 
t1_dt7ezag	1	*	I doubt they actually mean it.

t1_dt7ci3x	1	*	Anyone still remembers The Interview?
t1_dt7d2ls	1	*	Soooo, unify or die? No deal
t1_dt7egn4	1	*	It's so weird to hear and the mechanics of how this would be achieved are mind boggling. But as long as it's sincere it's a step in the right direction.
t1_dt75pdo	1	*	That would be the largest human shield in history, I imagine.
t1_dt7bxq0	1	*	Isn't this from the start of the game called homefront? 
t1_dt7p1l5	1	*	That's what they were saying early June 1950, that sure went well.
t1_dt7b5nd	1	*	Am I the only one who finds this.... odd? Like eerie awesome...
t1_dt7arl4	1	*	Smart political move. It puts all the pressure on Trump. 
t1_dt7kfwa	1	*	It's just a reunification of hockeyteam...
t1_dt7jota	1	*	I don't think so
t1_dt7dyne	1	*	Unified Korea with nukes? Japan would go nuclear, maybe, in Israel style. And that'll be China's nightmare.
t1_dtcimtp	1	*	Mr Blair. Please tell the whole story about the wars.
t1_dtcaadt	1	*	This bastard should be on gaol for crimes against humanity. Why is he given any air?

t1_dutyp3j	0	*	The Bible also teaches us to stone to death boys who disobey their parents, and that it's okay to sell displeasing daughters into slavery.   Perhaps we shouldn't let the Bible dictate our policy. 
t1_dutxaba	0	*	The Bible also teaches you not to be a dick

t1_dv05o9s	1	*	it's fucking developed.. wtf
t1_dv0stxi	0	*	Uh.. hey Korea... Ya slaves.  You should do something about that.
t1_dv0u57k	1	*	Thats not living. 
t1_dv185mz	1	*	Do they still consider SK a developing country? The first country to roll out 5G?   Seems like somebody moved the goalposts on them.
t1_dv08sy4	1	*	Wait...LoL, Diablo 3, and OW are considered jobs?  Explains how ppl die from playing em I guess 
t1_dv10imt	1	*	68 hours what the fuck. And the government their complains about falling birthrates no shit no adults have time for leisure.
t1_dv0m29z	1	*	What's really interesting is that despite their extremely long hours - they are not actually that productive during those hours.       
t1_dv0j0xo	1	*	I've never heard south Korea refered to as part of the 'developing world.

t1_dv0gltu	0	*	Not to be nitpicky, but is South Korea really a developing country?  Ive always thought of it as a fully industrialized, first world nation. 
t1_dv2augj	1	*	Wow, I don't even work half of that per week and I believe even this is too long.  How do people are even able to concentrate on their job if they work like 13 hours per day?
t1_dv1p83k	1	*	Less work? What is this, some sort of human well being first culture?
t1_dv11ccz	1	*	I don't understand this idea. How do they control the maximum hours people work a week? Can't people like... work more?
t1_dv0873g	1	*	Sorry but if south Korea is developing then I'm a Martian
t1_dv0dxxo	1	*	it wonk work  instead reducing work,they need to introduce more holidays,3 days working alternated by off day per week

t1_ds13gy1	1	*	Americans don't know the real enemy it's china not North Korea. NK is just a net of tennis.
t1_ds139x6	1	*	Doesnt he see just about any act as aggression though? Seems like hes setting a fairly low bar for himself.
t1_ds0ztr6	0	*	K cool cool cool, you go back to oppressing your people, and I'll stay alive right here. 
t1_ds14fir	0	*	How do you spell liar in north Korean?

t1_ds1bl6k	1	*	 wasn't that America's policy for the second half of the last century? Funny how it's totally reasonable when we do it but its insane when other countries do it. 
t1_ds2eit1	1	*	Duh. He's pretty good at dealing with Trump. He just matches him & shows that America aren't going to do anything once trumps threats don't work.

t1_ds166n2	1	*	He includes passive aggressive as well
t1_ds1c55l	1	*	Trump could eat an apple and KJU could consider it a threat
t1_ds15nrl	1	*	Honestly expected a follow up to the article where they explained someone sneezed and then he started telling about he will nuke that guy too
t1_ds1j1ux	1	*	Who the fuck does he think he is? Abt to be a file on the cover up of his death in 50 years from the CIA at this rate

t1_ds1bz4w	1	*	But they see a movie as an act of war ffs
t1_ds1aatl	1	*	The only thing he can realistically do is bomb the fuck out of Seoul with old-timey artillery.  The US can handle a missile, especially one with hours of travel time.
t1_ds1b12f	1	*	Put a bullet in his head, watch the people celebrate. They bow out of fear, not respect. They hate this man.
t1_ds1cxz8	1	*	Sometimes you have to flexU0001f3cbufe0f

t1_ds135l7	1	*	Does anyone else think that his hair looks like cat ears?
t1_ds13p4c	1	*	He CAN'T use nukes. The guy's an idiot and his regime sucks balls.
t1_ds1az1i	1	*	This would be great, but NK considers ANYTHING that's not in their best interest to be an aggression!
t1_ds17j2b	1	*	Thank you kim. Thats very kind of you.
t1_ds15cw4	1	*	phew!
t1_ds19j1v	1	*	And not bowing to our supreme power at all times will be recognized as aggression
t1_ds13tzi	1	*	Any country that doesn't want to be a US (or to a lesser extent Russian or Chinese) puppet HAS to get nuclear weapons ASAP. Those are the only countries we don't attack.
t1_ds140qi	1	*	To which pres. Trump retweeted pussy
t1_ds143to	1	*	This aggression will not stand, man
t1_ds1f5jc	1	*	I'm hoping for tensions between the North and South to cease, this could be the start of another Berlin Wall being torn down and families reunited. :)
t1_ds17s4k	1	*	what a reasonable dude
t1_ds1joas	1	*	Does nobody else remember the countless times Kim Jong Un as said he wants to bring nuclear clouds to Japan and the US? You can't believe a word this fool says.
t1_ds16ner	0	*	Maybe he should have thought of that before firing missiles over Japan?
t1_ds1kcbf	1	*	Finally backing off his practice of unconditional threats because if he tests one more device his precious nuke mountain will cave in and irradiate the whole peninsula. He knows it, we know it.
t1_ds1cyp9	0	*	Oh so now he's backing down because he realized how dumb they looked
t1_ds19sm9	1	*	We are not going to slow down your internet speed to make a fast lane. We just want the ability to do that . We aren't going to do it though but we need the ability to 
t1_ds150bz	1	*	So can the US just accept NK as a nuclear state now (if NK will drop the fierce rhetoric) and we can move on from this? Now work on reunification. 
t1_ds1d5oo	1	*	Yes but you think Tweets are agression, you bat shit crazy little man.
t1_ds1dj3q	0	*	Like this fat little shit actually thinks he would live long enough to see the missile impact before he and his dilapidated country are blown off the face of the fucking Earth.
t1_ds14jm4	1	*	Marica put that pressure on that ass.

t1_ds1fc7f	1	*	I thought North Korea used a different year count?
t1_ds1q2v9	1	*	Nostradamus predicted World War III for 2018.  I wonder if this guy is aware of that.
t1_ds163d0	0	*	Wait is a tyrannical leader, being more reasonable than trump??
t1_ds14e77	0	*	North Korea has been making these empty threats. Many of their recent rocket tests for instance have spectacularly failed. Worrying about North Korea seems silly as an American. 
t1_ds1w3ku	1	*	Yeah, so now Trump will just come out and provoke him more.  Gotta distract from that investigation all he can.
t1_ds1cpzh	1	*	Great, but what is his definition of aggression? A New York Times cartoon making fun of him?
t1_ds15hx6	1	*	*Trump spills water at UN meeting*
t1_ds12i0v	1	*	huh. Good luck with that buddy. nk is sitting on 9 trillion worth of natural resources. Even if they were a legit gov, they would have been tossed around until broken enough to take the resources. 
t1_ds1bp2l	1	*	Un's sitting in a very gray area with an ambiguous qualifier.  His people are still suffering. War for their sake would be the only justified scenario...  Even then, this is all worrying.
t1_ds14w8r	1	*	Oh god, don't let Trump hear this statement.
t1_dtme237	1	*	RIP Trudeau?

t1_dt0i45q	0	*	Its an embarrassment when she tries to talk English.
t1_du2qjq5	0	*	It emerged that the man, who has not been named, has suffered from rectal prolapse since he was just four.  No need to worry people! We can still play Pokemon while taking a poo!

t1_ds3274g	1	*	One reason why other cryptos that consume close to no energy will eventually take bitcoins place. Entirely a waste of electricity.
t1_ds30rqi	1	*	The entire cryptocurrency market is worth 625 Billion dollars. 
t1_ds2rvb6	1	*	This is only to increase even further, as the mining pools grow, as the difficulty increases, and as there is a total lack of consensus on the necessary changes to the bitcoin protocol.
t1_ds2xjtz	1	*	Yeah, with all the talk about this value, this is something few consider.

t1_dunv9uj	1	*	They also want to remove cheese from cheeseburgers ... but they won't till sometime around 2020 as well. It takes a long time for things to get done at McD's

t1_dunv2q6	1	*	What the fuck do they still serve in foam?
t1_dunvn4c	1	*	Did they not already do this?  Everything I've seen from a fast food place for ten years has been recyclable.  Cups, containers, trays, furniture...  Where was this happening still?
t1_dunv9lc	1	*	Good on you, McD

t1_dunuobq	1	*	I hate McDonald's and the way they try to push their unhealthy food with overly-cheery and sentimental ads, but this is a good move. Good for them. 
t1_dunv6c2	1	*	That's great. 40 years later than it needed to be, but great.

t1_dtjomww	1	*	Those poor, poor terrorists!
t1_dtin2ys	1	*	Gotta have somewhere to put all those political prisoners.
t1_dtiq5bi	1	*	Good. To be honest the prisoners should be placed on an island in the middle of the Pacific surrounded by sharks with laser beams attached to there friggin heads. But for now Gitmo will work.

t1_dtik4rx	0	*	I say pack up Gitmo prison and move it to the Aleutians.   Why should terrorists live in a tropical environment?    Nothing like a nice cold shower everyday to keep you in check.

t1_ds8jyo0	0	*	Christ people read the damn article. It doesn't say we should kill all existing pugs, it just says don't pay people to make them. Stop making ridiculous strawman arguments to defend your choices.
t1_ds8jqhv	1	*	Really all you have to do is clean under the flaps and eyes. Make sure the eyes are also clean and free of boogers. I will say mine struggled with skin allergies for a bit before I changed his diet. 
t1_ds8m48d	1	*	I love my two pugs and wouldnt trade them for the world.

t1_ds8renb	1	*	... Quick, someone start #breathetobreed!
t1_dsfxd3n	1	*	For any small dog its a good idea to give them ramps to go up & down the furniture; in my case, I put down cushions and taught them to use it when jumping off the bed or couch.
t1_ds8sdh6	0	*	Me and my Boston send our regards

t1_ds8oc14	1	*	Stop breeding mutated animals. 
t1_ds8q7lu	1	*	My SO likes these dogs, all the flat-faced inbred ones. More than anything, she wants a boston terrier.  I want a healthy and happy golden retriever.  We'll compromise, and probably get a pig.
t1_ds8py2w	1	*	I want a dog, but do you have anything with an awake-apnea kind of feel to it? I got you bro... heres a pug.

t1_ds8sp27	1	*	finally someone understands!
t1_ds8ezt1	1	*	I never found squash face dogs very cute (I like them big fluffy wolf boiz), but I really pity them. Its so weird that people make a living reproducing other animals and selling the offspring. 
t1_ds8j6lu	1	*	Dogs in general need to be bred for health, temperament, and intelligence. I get that certain aesthetics are fun, but not at the cost of a living creature's well-being and longevity. 
t1_ds8i8kj	1	*	It's wild that their eyeballs can just pop out.
t1_ds9acl9	1	*	Everyone has always known this. My friend has a pug and you can hear it with every breath it takes. It's nuts that people simply overlook it

t1_ds95uyn	1	*	Or just don't but any dog because that's fucking disgusting
t1_ds8hscu	1	*	Well obviously. You just have to look at them to know they have some sort of problems.
t1_dx8p3vp	1	*	Nowadays, there are more and more families with dogs, and more and more families like to keep some expensive dogs. At the same time, they hope these families take good care of the small animals.

t1_ds8cg5c	1	*	Few things are as unpleasant as hearing a bulldog struggle to breathe.

t1_dtjhpcv	1	*	Benches are made for sitting, not sleeping. It's hard to sit on a bench if someone is sleeping on it. Bars make sitting on the bench easier.

t1_dtj1ds5	1	*	What a bunch of pussies
t1_dtjuz4p	1	*	damn they could have at least made it into an armrest instead of that useless shape
t1_dtixuz9	1	*	I say keep them. Now they won't have a risk of falling and if they throw a blanket over it it can become a fort. 
t1_dtjakho	1	*	Place some non hostile benches in front of the houses of those screaming about the inhumanity.  Like resident artist, Stuart Semple. Let's see how long he enjoys the view from his window.

t1_dtj1rrm	1	*	Pssh. That ain't shit. In my city they put metal/concrete spikes on the ground underneath overhangs. But the park benches have had anti-sleep stuff like this on them for literally decades.
t1_dtje6j2	1	*	Just slip under the bar
t1_dtiyxcn	1	*	They could be like NYC and just never provide any person a place to sit or go to the bathroom.

t1_dtj6iwm	0	*	Everybody cares about homeless people that aren't near them.

t1_ds1k7m0	1	*	Right on the money once again
t1_ds1eeu0	1	*	First thing I agree with him. Good job
t1_ds1innr	1	*	Now we let the bad guys hide in Russia controlled areas
t1_ds1s5no	1	*	Thank God for Trump. I can't wait for the next seven years.
t1_ds1m634	1	*	I mean, he's not wrong. 
t1_ds1f0oq	1	*	The problem with this is that China will swoop in and try to gain control of some of the strategic areas 
t1_ds1f19k	1	*	I hate the dictatorial pumpkin as much as the next guy, but when hes right, hes right. 
t1_ds2guz0	1	*	finally. a president that look at the ROI( return on investment)
t1_ds217nr	1	*	It's like he's trying to stay a war or something.
t1_ds1ri3j	1	*	Hey I agree with trump on something, wild!
t1_ds1gpkh	1	*	Tbh I'm kinda with this move. And I would've been with him if he had stood up to the saudis but all that talk and he just got right down on his knees for them.
t1_ds20gea	1	*	He could rightly accuse himself of the same  
t1_ds1nm8n	1	*	Saying terrorists we hunt seems very animalistic of us
t1_ds2xn6p	1	*	I'm sure he'll act reasonably and responsibly when dealing with a powerful nuclear state.  Right?
t1_ds1hu5t	1	*	Sure he is right, but I can't imagine that it will be handled with any grace or care. Will probably turn in to a cluster fuck and will probably fuck up some aspect of this. Let's be real.
t1_ds1edso	0	*	Why isnt he this vocal towards SA?
t1_ds1yacu	1	*	FUCK THIS GUY
t1_ds1fh7i	1	*	Pakistan is a cesspit. Should be wiped off the map but this is a good start.
t1_ds1pke2	1	*	He is right
t1_ds1tynp	1	*	The man shouldn't be in charge of a country but he's right.
t1_ds20ig8	1	*	Probably not the right place for this sort of thing, but the TV show Homeland does an excellent job describing the relationship between the US and Pakistan. For once, I agree with the President here.
t1_ds1xre4	1	*	Lol.  The bigger question is this: What does he plan to do with those Aid money? He has already cut programs just to fund his trips. I wonder what trip he planning to take this time.
t1_ds1s9b7	0	*	Are we pretending what trump said isnt 100% accurate??
t1_ds22m8v	1	*	By that logic, we don't have to pay our taxes while he's in office. Good luck waging war without being able to pay the troops, you racist, pussy-grabbing, Russian mob shill.
t1_ds22m8t	1	*	You are really grasping at straws now. Telling the truth is now an attack? Grow up!
t1_ds1itd1	1	*	https://i.imgur.com/1BrLt3t.jpg Lies! Deceit!
t1_ds2u6du	1	*	Great, this means the end of NATO/US operations in Afghanistan and troop withdrawal. Anything else would be just shit talking. 
t1_ds1rsra	1	*	Well, at least for once he's not lying. Pakistan has been sheltering terrorists for years. 
t1_ds1gqrh	1	*	This fat orange fuck is trying to start a nuclear war...
t1_ds1iu3m	1	*	Go trump! It's true!
t1_ds1g0v7	1	*	Ahh first day of the new year and already off to some breaking news. Anyways happy New year's people hope you had a good send off to 2017.
t1_ds1hb22	1	*	It's not if trump would use that money to help his own country, they(the lobbyist) just want to keep those poppy seed fields protected so his base can stay fucked up on heroin and make more money. 
t1_ds1nlkq	1	*	As a lib he's right on this one.
t1_ds1vqnb	1	*	This is unlike Trump himself, who merely gives us *mostly* lies and deceit.
t1_ds1e2wq	1	*	If he actually follows through on this, it will be the only thing I like about him.
t1_ds1ikom	1	*	Can't stand trump, but he has a very valid point.
t1_ds1gas0	1	*	Glumpfy bad. :)
t1_ds1jkix	1	*	sounds like he is trying to start a war to boost his numbers
t1_ds1jkit	1	*	On the other hand Pakistan has to bear the brunt of any military actions taken in their country (e.g. assassinations, bombings, etc).
t1_ds1jkm8	1	*	Even a broken 24 hour clock is right once a day. /s 
t1_ds1xuke	1	*	Oh look, shiny PR from a bloviating asshole. And in he gloriously ushers us into his season of peace. Where he makes populist statements and brigades the forums with thundering applause. 
t1_ds217j6	0	*	Excellant. Wall nearly funded. 
t1_ds1edav	1	*	Starting the year off right, with Reddit agreeing with what the president is saying. 2018 is looking up.
t1_ds1ghu5	1	*	Goddamnit I agree with him. I said this out loud the year we killed OBL.
t1_ds1hizp	1	*	Is he lying? They only knew about Osama Bin Laden.  You know. Osama. Bin Laden.
t1_ds1hf82	0	*	I dont like Donald and didnt vote for him but I do like how hes tough on these middle eastern countries 
t1_ds1f1ql	1	*	well, he's not wrong, fuck Pakistan
t1_ds1rjl8	1	*	Accurate 
t1_ds1hdy7	1	*	Another relationship he's going to hose, endangering many lives in the process.
t1_ds1enll	1	*	Wow I cant wait to see how anyone could disagree with that...
t1_ds1l2sf	1	*	About DAMN Time...
t1_ds1ev9a	0	*	How to push Pakistan in China's arms, your president is truly a diplomatic genius. 
t1_ds1kx7y	1	*	Is he trying to attack Pakistan ? 
t1_ds1o3u1	1	*	Thank God none of you actually have any power. You would be taking human lives left, right and centre...
t1_ds1l224	1	*	Out of the things this moron says. This is one thing that he is right about. 
t1_ds1pxwg	1	*	This is actually the correct policy, just the wrong technique.  No need to publicly embarrass Pakistan.  That just makes things worse.
t1_ds1obhs	1	*	Am from Pakistan  Hate Pakistan for this shit
t1_ds1j4i2	1	*	Well, he's not wrong
t1_ds1p5q1	1	*	Lies! Deception! 
t1_ds1f4m8	1	*	#draintheswamps! #MAGA
t1_ds29sjh	1	*	I think he's right.
t1_ds1il4g	1	*	In B4 we invade Pakistan for dubious reasons.
t1_ds1fqqm	1	*	I don't like Trump at all but he isn't wrong on this one - They aren't friends 
t1_ds1fqqx	1	*	Downvote if you want but he is absolutely correct.  Glad that they were finally called on their bullshit.
t1_ds1p02z	1	*	Dealing with Pakistan is one of the few areas I think Trump can actually make an improvement.    Maybe the only.   So probably not.
t1_ds1trg4	1	*	I hate Trump, but he's not wrong. I only wish he would call out the Salafi terror state that is Saudi Arabia. 
t1_ds1iqz6	1	*	It's a nice change from the obsequious way he seems to praise Pakistan every chance he got 
t1_ds1roed	1	*	well, he is right about that
t1_ds1n2kx	0	*	I hate trump. But i mean Pakistan does do some bullshit. 
t1_ds1hmyy	1	*	just goes to show, the fact that that dude said something has nothing whatsoever to do with the statement's truth value. I agree with this statement to an extent.
t1_ds1iws4	0	*	Well... He's not wrong.  But he's still an asshole.
t1_ds1f47r	1	*	Ok? Tweet and probably do nothing, hes a troll so he trolls for his base. So we cut funds, thatll make them happy and stabilize the region. Oops, we have the war hes itching for so badly. 
t1_ds1weu4	0	*	History time! 10 points to the first person who points out where all these terrorist organizations have been getting their arms from for decades.
t1_ds1qzuk	1	*	This is the first thing that Donald Trump had said that I agree with. I must be going crazy.
t1_ds1qda0	1	*	Where are all the asshats now, defending the reason for giving money to Pakistan? Well shit birds what do you have to say now?
t1_ds1j0yh	0	*	Okay is he gonna do anything or is this just fodder to make his base happy
t1_ds1gbws	1	*	I know the article talks about releasing some guy being released, but is there any proof that the Pakistani government is behind the support for the terrorists? 
t1_ds1gwcy	1	*	Pakistan is going to have a lot of equipment that is not going to work very well without proper maintenance.
t1_ds1wo67	0	*	Cool, so instead of a stabilish afghan/Pak border we are gonna have another demilitarized zone just without the demilitarized part 
t1_ds1w1m6	0	*	Waiting for people to defend what a great ally Pakistan has been to the US, with their military hiding Bin Laden and all.
t1_ds1ut0i	1	*	News must be slow today if were reprinting long held views by the US.
t1_ds1gb4s	1	*	He isn't wrong.
t1_ds1edgs	1	*	Wish he would say the same about the Saudis as well.
t1_ds1j70l	1	*	SO MANY SHILLS IN THIS THREAD. NO POINT IN REPLYING.   Forget russian net army. The israeli/wests shills are worse. Thread is full of bulls**ts and i concurs. 
t1_ds1hpdg	1	*	Holy shit 2018 is starting off weird, I'm agreeing with Trump.  
t1_ds1i370	0	*	Is he wrong?
t1_ds3u405	1	*	Why should Pakistan attack someone who isn't Pakistan's enemy?
t1_ds1zpco	1	*	Ummm...I hate to say it, but I'm OK with this.
t1_ds1jv8h	1	*	He's not wrong though
t1_ds27f1q	0	*	U0001f923U0001f923U0001f923 u/trytousecommonsense   Where is your state of denial now?
t1_ds1zjjd	1	*	Is he aware Pakistan has nukes? The situation is far more complicated than he is willing, or capable of understanding. 
t1_ds1j6q8	1	*	I really dislike this president and just about every move he has made in his first year in office has been terrible but, he is 100% right this time. Fuck Pakistan
t1_ds1eb6y	0	*	The amazing moment where, for once, Trump appears to actually know what he's talking about.
t1_ds1i2hu	1	*	So he's going to try to start a war to keep power.
t1_ds1prju	0	*	Not a Trump fan, but he's not wrong on this one.
t1_ds1eszl	0	*	He is right. But whining about it on twitter and pissing off terrorists, is not he best way to deal with the problem
t1_ds20mem	1	*	Aww man, this mother fucker is really trying his god damned hardest to destroy Americaufe0f, more than it already is...
t1_ds21sli	0	*	Today must be cold day in Hell because for once I agree with the Donald.
t1_ds1uhlq	1	*	Bout time we put our foot down.
t1_ds1c8yk	1	*	Hes completely right. 
t1_ds1eye3	1	*	New year, new Trump? /s  All joking aside he is correct on this issue. 
t1_ds1iof2	1	*	Well a broken clock is right twice a day
t1_ds1l8zu	0	*	Trumps got bigger problems to sort out right now instead of worrying about Pakistan.... North Korea for example
t1_ds228ny	1	*	Now I wonder if Trump will attack himself for giving safe havens to white supremacists and neo-nazis. Unfortunately not.
t1_ds2a1ua	1	*	Why doesn't Trump verbally berate Saudi Arabia the nation the funded 9/11? Does he have business with them or something?
t1_ds225l4	1	*	Lies, deception - Saw Guerrera
t1_ds1iutv	1	*	They also have nuclear weapons and a strong dislike for India.
t1_ds1et2c	1	*	Greatest con ever if you can even call it that.
t1_ds1vpv3	1	*	It's New Year's I'm tryna chill, let me know whenever something actually happens
t1_ds1gr4o	1	*	TIL the truth is an attack
t1_ds1g3br	0	*	The only real terrorist here is Donald Trump and his government...
t1_ds1gs3b	1	*	For once, hes right...
t1_ds1knbw	1	*	Senile Trump trying to distract from his failing Presidency
t1_ds1exa7	1	*	One year in, he's just figured this out. Another 3 years he'll realize Russia might not be our friend either.
t1_ds1gdku	1	*	Interesting the verbiage used. If another president said this, I don't think it would be attacks. 
t1_ds2d99v	1	*	I agree with the sentiment wholeheartedly, but it's pretty meaningless coming in a tweet...
t1_ds1in0t	1	*	I got nervous when it said, Donald Trump's attacks.... 
t1_ds1hdqg	1	*	I was reading through all the comments convinced this was talking about Palestine, so confused. Didn't know Pakistan were hiding all this, mad! Thanks for the knowledge Reddit
t1_ds1lisb	0	*	Keep this shit up and there'll be a lot more Pakistani terrorists he'll have to handle. The Great Negotiator, everyone.
t1_ds1k2yq	1	*	One of the most crooked countries in the world where honor killings are normal. Why I am not surprised Trump is not acting like Barry Hussein Obama? 
t1_ds1r2mo	1	*	Well they needed 50bn to really get anything done though.
t1_ds1yff9	1	*	Now the left gonna be pro Isis because their Trump Derangement Syndrome keeps them from any semblance of objectivity
t1_ds1eo4e	0	*	I hate the guy with a passion but a good move is a good move and I'll tip my hat at this one. 
t1_ds1i73c	1	*	What would happen if the aid stops? Could Pakistan collapse into a nuclear armed rogue state? 
t1_ds1d7vo	1	*	You tell em Donny!!
t1_ds1ex7t	1	*	Could it be?? Something we all agree on?!
t1_ds1idwu	1	*	Might be the first thing i agree with that Trump said. Wow 2018 is starting weird...
t1_ds272hx	1	*	He is not exactly wrong...
t1_ds1gosl	1	*	Pakistan is one of the biggest sponsors of terrorism next to Saudi Arabia, if the US could stop giving aid to both of them then the world would be a much better place
t1_ds1jk6m	1	*	He's not wrong. Good for him.
t1_ds1mws8	1	*	We giving money to these pieces of shit? Lol
t1_ds1on5e	0	*	why is everyone concerned about terrorists. Especially on home soil? Here's a stat to consider...body count 2017 Terrorists - 12!  horrible huh? Police - 1187.. truth hurts
t1_ds1gtpt	1	*	The day has come, trump has spoken something that most of the US actually agreed with. 
t1_ds1fzko	1	*	Jesus Reddit I those first four words had me like Fucking 2018 goddammit... Thought Trump had launched a missile or something.
t1_ds1j9vp	1	*	Its about time someone dealt with those pricks......i say we fund india and turn them loose. Gurkas are tough.
t1_ds28xyc	1	*	All tweet, no action.
t1_ds1q0yt	1	*	> Donald Trump ***attacks*** Pakistan ...  I don't think that word means what you think it means.
t1_ds1m4zi	1	*	It takes one to know one.
t1_ds1j8yg	1	*	Good.  Pakistan is no friend to the USA
t1_ds1due0	0	*	The first news I see in 2018 of the orange Cheeto is him making sense? What is happening?
t1_ds1qeen	1	*	Uh, good?
t1_ds1eg5d	1	*	Well I hate to admit it, but... he's not wrong.
t1_ds1eu0x	1	*	Great way to push them toward Chinese. This is not how you resolve shit. Soon China will be the Boss of Asia.
t1_ds1fv29	1	*	Finally something sane from the mouth of Trump. Wow, 2018. started good.
t1_ds1lfpf	1	*	Top notch reporting as usual....
t1_ds1j6wm	1	*	Hes right tho.   Strap up your boots India! Were gonna get you Kashmir back.
t1_ds1g1w9	1	*	Please let this be something must of us agree on. But I don't think military action is needed.
t1_ds1he0m	1	*	While I dislike Trump, I can't say this statement is untrue.
t1_ds1gjxc	1	*	An interesting way to start the New Year.
t1_ds1i8rn	1	*	Amen brother. 
t1_ds1h006	1	*	oh... for a second I thought attack meant attack
t1_ds1hl2m	1	*	At least trump has the balls to say it .. say what you will about trump but he isn't afraid to speak his mind
t1_ds27853	1	*	Oh dear the covfefe has begun again
t1_ds1j7ox	1	*	He's not wrong. The Taliban hid out in their mountains while Osama got a private compound to live in.
t1_ds1m38s	1	*	Israel doesn't serve our foreign aid at all, billions need to paid back to the Americans.
t1_ds1ns68	1	*	Why the flair? Its Trump; so far all he has done is tweet and complain. So when I saw Trump attacks, I instinctively thought, Oh, he tweeted something aggressive again!
t1_ds1n8xx	1	*	Good, now let's see if he actually follows through and stops sending them money. 
t1_ds1hkwb	1	*	So which country are they going to use as a stable base to resupply their forces in Afghanistan? India? Russia? Iran?
t1_ds1eudw	1	*	Sssssso is this an excuse to go into another war? Or expand it?
t1_ds1yf5e	1	*	Attack is definitely the wrong word. Especially because hes actually right about this.
t1_ds1grln	1	*	I agree with Trump on this one.   Ill never ever vote for a man who insulted gold star families or POWs but hes right in this one instance.
t1_ds1zk9l	0	*	Good. If he follows through with it, amazing. You can hate him. You can love him. But let's be real, Pakistan is not someone we want to be friends with. 
t1_ds1r8bd	1	*	remember when reddit wasn't a toxic echo chamber of anti trump everyday
t1_ds1fchg	1	*	Yeah, i totally believe Trump. He was down there with our boys on 7/11 after all. I can't believe this clown is the most powerful man in the world. We are Doomed. 
t1_ds1ko6w	1	*	Few things would make me happier than cutting ties with those primitive scumbags in Pakistan. 
t1_ds1gql9	1	*	Mr. Trump, you also provide save haven to terrorists.  Just because they're white supremacists like you doesn't mean they aren't terrorists.  Fuck you, you stupid motherfucker.
t1_ds1mwd7	1	*	He is just DESPERATE to start a nuclear war with someone. Korea hasn't happened yet so I guess he is branching out.
t1_ds1utny	1	*	He'll be accused of being clueless, politically untried, fumbling and generally not adept (all of which is true)... *however*, he is also not wrong.
t1_ds1j30d	0	*	Didnt they have osama in their country and people in their military knew and did nothing? I mean I agree with trump here. 
t1_ds1fefr	1	*	Looks like i can agree with Trump on at least one thing
t1_duf4805	1	*	Whatever you do, do well... props young man
t1_dsgmbky	1	*	With the USA actively seeking to prosecute journalists for treason for much the same thing, it seems a little hypocritical or are American state secrets more important than Myanmars'? 
t1_dsiuulv	1	*	Nice.  When does Trump get his own square in Moscow?
t1_du5s2ov	1	*	Are there no oncologists in central America?
t1_dsxl7qj	1	*	Read as: hey guys, you know how we just kicked ourselves out of Europe? What if we built a 100 billion dollar bridge to Europe! 
t1_dsgghoe	1	*	Dios Mio.

t1_dt4enjk	1	*	See! Gun Control works!    /s
t1_dtq82ow	1	*	people have a way of blaming problems on immigrants and poor people for economic or social succes it happens everywhere. 
t1_dtq6rfw	1	*	No one is illegal. Undocumented is the word.
t1_dtqkaz5	1	*	They let in mass refugees to European nations but are picky on who they let enter Israel. Classic Jews.
t1_dtq4ktp	0	*	Right, what if those migrant create another state on those lands?
t1_dtqissm	1	*	Israel deporting people fleeing war, how ironic.
t1_dtql5w6	1	*	Their rationale:  But what if the Palestinians see??!??  An obnoxious people thrust upon the globe for the rest to deal with their guilt harvesting, lowballing, self loathing superfluous existence.
t1_dtqd39j	1	*	Is this the definition of irony?
t1_dtpyeqm	0	*	Props to them for not going the Germany/Sweden route and thinking about the future of their country.
t1_dtqelf0	1	*	Bend over Sweden.  Get ready for some more fun!
t1_dtr4rbe	1	*	In the comments: uninformed people on both sides. I suggest you read some of Norman Finklesteins work or watch an interview or two.
t1_dtqo523	1	*	Yeah America. Let the Jews force us to keep them. But they will not. 
t1_dtqwvb1	1	*	Another pogrom begins.

t1_du11jdx	1	*	Well, they can't say they weren't warned.
t1_du122tr	1	*	Well this should resolve peacefully...

t1_dsp5b9s	1	*	They probably aren't, they're more than likely just looking to make foreign governments waste money on defences in the same way they bankrupted themselves due to the Star Wars program.
t1_dsp101v	1	*	why TF is it that everything has to be nuclear with the Russians ?
t1_dsp31s7	1	*	Hey Russia, knock it the fuck off.
t1_dspi8ai	1	*	The Russians tested a 50 megatons bomb in the like 60s and thought it was too big
t1_dsowgo8	0	*	And I saw people saying Russia couldn't sever the transatlantic communication cables because the technology was too hard to implement lmao.

t1_dspg2mw	1	*	*A weapon to surpass Metal Gear!*
t1_dsp7tuc	1	*	So what.  Mutually Assured Destruction prevents any of these gross wastes of resources from ever being actually used.
t1_dsooszq	1	*	Literally any city with a river could have these drones in it then? Scary thought 
t1_dsp4n41	1	*	Would this be a surface detonation or would it go airborne when it got close to it's target?  
t1_dsp3bth	0	*	So uncivilized... 
t1_dsp6cht	1	*	You mean a submarine... only externally controlled. 
t1_dspfkp2	1	*	Oh well 
t1_dsour66	1	*	More propaganda, who leaked it? This works into the posturing of the military industrial complex 
t1_dspruwr	1	*	Who cares? If this thing was ever used it would be part of a total nuclear exchange that would end civilization.
t1_dsp5ljb	1	*	The Tsar Bomba was only 50 MT.  Why not just say A million gazillion MT?
t1_dsok9na	1	*	I never heard any news about it, but I constantly assume that the largest countries have the advanced sci-fi stuff already. I am not surprised. Of course I am worried

t1_dsojhgl	0	*	Its called a submarine. We too have lots of those.
t1_dsphdes	1	*	This seems like an obvious weapons progression.   More interesting question is if they stole our design or if we stole theirs.

t1_dsojr7a	0	*	Who gives a fuck.  if it goes off, so what.
t1_dson02n	1	*	These leaks sometimes do more harm than good. There is a reason why these are classified information.
t1_dsozqwl	1	*	For why do you need this...
t1_dsozrnu	0	*	I call BS. There's no submarine in the world that can carry a [100 megaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba) warhead internally.
t1_dspf616	1	*	100MT nukes are so needless/wasteful. There's a reason nuclear yield of warheads has gone down so much over the past years. High yield is only needed due to low accuracy.
t1_dspeu5y	1	*	Trump : I got a one too , mine is bigger 
t1_dspsso8	1	*	How are the Russians  in possession didn't they **build** the damn thing?

t1_dsp5e5i	1	*	You ever think about like... why did we invent bombs in the first place?
t1_dspgcfu	1	*	I guess all they need now is a 100-megaton nuclear warhead and theyll really have something. 
t1_dsptx20	1	*	I wonder how high this one could fire a manhole cover!
t1_dspefcs	0	*	How big is a 100 megaton warhead?
t1_dspdhab	1	*	Next week they'll intentionally leak the fact that it only needs a single tugboat omg I'm so scared of the ruslamic state
t1_dsp7zz9	1	*	This is MAD
t1_dsp52iv	1	*	Good. Some one else can shoot the crazy man down then.
t1_dspbjrr	0	*	Russia, for a nation that supposedly is having economic problems because of the falling oil prices-they have surely done wonders with their military budget versus that of the U.S.
t1_dsp1v28	1	*	Dick measuring contest, who is bigger...  We all know if US and Russia went to nuclear war, no one would survive.  End of the World Event, which will never happen.
t1_dspjwqa	1	*	Where's the footage of a small dingie floating through a pond?...I feel that would make this news more entertaining.
t1_dsp8170	0	*	Is it somehow scarier that there are UNMANNED nuclear capable submarines out there?

t1_dsp33rh	1	*	Come to think of it, thats actually a menacingly clever idea 
t1_dsowao6	1	*	It's okay guys, we have a super smart genius in the oval office.  Surely he will prevent such catastrophes. 
t1_dsojrne	1	*	Easily possible with seventies tech, so it's no surprise it's Russia doing it.
t1_dsp5b15	1	*	oof time for nightmares
t1_dspcvs4	1	*	I hope everybody realizes at this point, NO ONE should want this to ever go off
t1_dsp2a83	1	*	Metal Gear Ray.
t1_dsovva2	1	*	Anybody with the ability to operate an RC car and the budget could have a nuclear drone... Am not shocked.

t1_dsp4qcx	1	*	We need this drone to become sentient, gain a Scotish accent and them defect to the US.
t1_dsp4p18	1	*	I don't think Putin understands how we in this hemisphere respond to fear.  He does not want us to be thinking like this - at least not with himself as the focus. 
t1_dsp4e0p	1	*	Cold war 2 baby
t1_ds88qb6	1	*	I am curious to what happens to the ones that are jailed.Do people ever see them again ?

t1_dssyzvw	1	*	I mean they're not wrong but look in the mirror
t1_dsrwuxo	1	*	North Korea? Who cares?
t1_dss2jaj	1	*	LOL the irony in this all is just too much for reality itself
t1_dsrs1en	1	*	Maybe they realize theyre dealing with an actual crazy person and they will stop all this talk about nuking us. 
t1_dss2puf	1	*	Pot: Hey Kettle you're black.  
t1_dsrw53l	1	*	Let us bond with our North Korean friends over this shared opinion.
t1_dsrtlhw	1	*	When you agree with North Korea, it's either really great and a miracle happened, or it's really bad and really sad. I'm not even American and I'm pissed how that guy became president
t1_dsrngjf	1	*	Sure is crazy seeing N.Korea being the sane ones, what a world we're living in today..
t1_dsrzv2g	1	*	Well. They arent wrong...

t1_dsrvtw0	1	*	Its a real shame North Korea arrests Americans and kills them otherwise Im sure all these liberals would be chartering Jets to hep out their starving masses and assist their dictator.  
t1_dss2h31	1	*	So we listen to the BS that Kim is saying now?

t1_dsrzxtu	1	*	Its funny because hes not wrong, but Trump wouldnt be wrong either if their roles were reversed.
t1_dss1e4r	1	*	Hey assholes!  Only we are allowed to make fun of our President!
t1_dsrqdva	0	*	Thats what trump wants. Its genius. It makes them think hes crazy enough to actually fuck them up. Something they knew Obama would never do.  This will make them respect USA and follow the rules

t1_dsrp57a	1	*	well, they're not wrong...
t1_dsrox8x	1	*	You mean firing possible nuclear weapons over another sovereign country without their permission is not?
t1_dsrw9bf	1	*	I love that the anti trumpers are so desperate for fresh outrage they are now siding with an actual totalitarian regime.   You can't make this stuff up.
t1_dsrinu8	1	*	But its OK for Kim to say it on a weekly basis? 
t1_dsrl9m9	1	*	This is the worst type of stuff. I hate the Kim regime yet now I agree with what they said.   Its a catch 22. 
t1_dsrp9yk	1	*	Yeah that's the fucking pot calling the kettle black.
t1_dsswlem	1	*	Why would I care what north Korea thinks? About anything... ever?
t1_dss0437	0	*	At this point I have more in common with North Korea than my own president. 
t1_dsrmnpb	0	*	Instead of a nonsense war they should enter a boxing ring and fight each other to death and end with all this.
t1_dsrtf64	1	*	Ohhhhh snap
t1_dss9xxd	1	*	North Korea.  The new voice of reason, relative to the US.
t1_dss3g49	1	*	I mean, they aint wrong.

t1_dsrsh7l	1	*	Late maybe, but pretty accurate regardless. 
t1_dsrml1s	0	*	Says the country where residents cant get to Twitter. 
t1_dsryu92	1	*	Once again we're giving attention to North Korea where no attention needed to be given... 
t1_dsrwqw9	1	*	He's not wrong, but he is a hypocrite.
t1_dsrvo2p	1	*	Sounds like a great name for a metal band
t1_dsrpkkc	1	*	When you are being called out by NK you've reached a new level of bizarre.
t1_dsrnxoe	1	*	Honestly I feel like this will make NK not want to fuck with the US during his presidency 
t1_dss0b9x	1	*	Try as I might, I can't find anything inaccurate in their statement. They've got the dotard pegged well
t1_dsrlmhe	0	*	I agree with NK?
t1_dsrueqs	1	*	Can we just troll North Korea with fake news of reports of them bombing and invading other nations?
t1_dss7jsl	1	*	We have come to a point where we are starting to agree with North Korea. What a time to be alive.
t1_dsrpy3d	1	*	You are giving credit to NK, good job bois
