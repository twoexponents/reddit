t1_dtze83o	1	*	Definitely hard to watch... 
t1_dtzv6ib	0	*	The problem with fish is that they're becoming increasingly contaminated. Mercury in tuna and such.
t1_dtzy128	1	*	True, but only when you have to choose between the two. A third option exists.

t1_dtzl4kw	1	*	But mass murder and torture has never been so damn tasty. 
t1_dtzvmh6	0	*	Im not being funny. I really was curious..U0001f641
t1_dtzgx2b	1	*	You're trying desperately to justify to cruelty to animals.
t1_dtzwzt3	0	*	And is grocery store meat reasonable like your life/death situation?
t1_dtzf809	0	*	If we assume plants are sentient beings capable of feeling emotion and pain, youd probably be right.
t1_du0ab1o	0	*	Fallacious argument. Enjoying something doesn't mean that it's immoral either.
t1_dtzhnzp	1	*	Thank you! This is amazing.

t1_dtzk9tz	1	*	It might even be very painful.
t1_dtzj3gv	0	*	But you'll put in your mouth? 
t1_dtzqi9n	1	*	The hate is a transparent projection of judgment from meat eaters. 
t1_dtztxa0	1	*	/r/iamverybadass
t1_dtzl95z	1	*	But don't worry everyone here buys local so they're not contributing to it at all.     /s
