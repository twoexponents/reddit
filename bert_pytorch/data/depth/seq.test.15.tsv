t1_dsw2rfa	1	*	Predictable silence, thanks for showing us the source of your argument.
t1_du45wps	0	*	Actually USA helped China secure SCS back when they were still allies after the WWII. The 11 dotted lines was drawn with the help of US Navy since China's was in shambles. 
t1_dss7b2n	0	*	I guess I just got emotional dude, I'm sorry.  It just makes me angry to see all the suffering and attempts at change going on over there being waved off just as a Zionist conspiracy, you know.
t1_due083g	0	*	Blackface isn't an issue in China until western media reported on it. If you watched the skit, the blackface actress actually poked fun at the guy with the mic not the other way around. 
t1_dsusoph	0	*	Again, Israel offers peace the palestinians are the ones who refuse peace and demand conflict and then cry like babies because they are in a conflict that they and they alone want.
t1_dutppku	0	*	Egghead experts in the ivory tower is fine with me.   Doublespeak is dangerous. Its the stuff of cults.   As long as words mean things, I dont give a shit how people use them. 
t1_duv6x6u	0	*	Give me one such vaccine
t1_ds5iazz	0	*	You know there's not much of a difference right?  I guess making it a requirement for the people is fair, but not for making a requirement for companies to do it.
t1_dto3sjo	0	*	Thanks, nice to know it's not just me. 
t1_dto3usd	1	*	In the morning I will read this.  I promise.  Regardless, I suggest that  you would do better if you weren't such a righteous dick when clearly your righteousness is false in the first place. 
t1_dum20s8	0	*	that's true and nevertheless my statement is correct.
t1_du04s4x	0	*	I didn't say the invasion was right. But it sure puts a different spin on the invasion (both Iraq and Kuwait) than what most in the west were told.  Almost like it was all about oil.
t1_duseio8	1	*	The irony 
t1_dv8u3j2	1	*	Ok next time I wont
t1_dsugg5l	0	*	The gains in stock market are all post-election. It is unmistakable that the President gets credit for the economy being so great. Economists agree.

t1_du4v3kv	1	*	Okay. Well you keep believing the Russian government is targeting women because Putin is an absolute villain.   
t1_dttefjn	1	*	It was a joke and it seems to have distracted you, although considering how adimant trump is to build the wall im thinking maybe its true
t1_dtvve4u	1	*	Whatever helps you sleep at night 
t1_dttj1hl	0	*	Don't forget you only made that with 1200 hours of overtime. Real salary is more like 75k.
t1_dttd171	0	*	Wow, sexist much?  California is the bread winner of the states, so if it is acting on emotions then it's working out well for it.
t1_dttsnk5	0	*	I pay nearly 30% in total taxes and make much less money than you claim to. How does that work?
t1_dttnjhq	0	*	Either write a reply that's worth reading, or don't reply at all.

t1_dtul1lg	0	*	You seem to like taking a lot of back handed pot shots at the time I'm taking to talk to you (FUNNY!) but isn't this kind of a pot calling the kettle black situation? That's a joke, child.
t1_dttc690	0	*	I don't understand why you're even trying to come close to forming an argument in favour of your system. Your health care is inhumane and any measures to fix it are fantastic.
t1_dtvc63r	1	*	Another trump supporter...yeah everyone except US is a communist. I'm not going to argue.

t1_dte11nx	0	*	You sound like a miserable person with nothing better to do than seek out conflict in the internet.   Good luck with that. 
t1_dtf15r9	0	*	Okay, who were they?
t1_dtfwchh	0	*	okay
t1_dte1xue	0	*	I'd say racism is pretty easy to define. As soon as somebody judges or dislikes someone just because of their ethnicity (or race), it's racism.
t1_dssdyi0	1	*	Not really, no.   Sanders lost the primary election. Not because Clintons an evil genius, but because the voters chose her.   
t1_dt6bm7q	1	*	Sorry, did I miss something?  Because you're the one that's insulting me here for no other reason than you disagree with me. You are a bigot. 
t1_duf0pbf	1	*	A very tiny minority part. 
t1_dsvkvjh	1	*	No. Even if you disagree with me I dont exactly know what I said that was historically inaccurate? 
t1_dsa2u9r	1	*	You're right, colonialism and racial supremacy are indeed Western values.

t1_dsdv82q	0	*	Like I said before, thanks for your input, 
t1_dt7arwa	0	*	And yet you didn't define what means of production is. What are means of production for software engineer? Does owning a computer make one a bourgeoisie?
t1_dt93c89	1	*	So I guess making fun of flat-earthers is out of bounds as well? Their arguments should be critiqued on their own merits?
t1_dulzu2w	0	*	What about England? The country is officially Christian, but again, you can be whatever you want to be.
t1_dsnjbhv	1	*	Oh, that's very true because one Satan 2 can carry like 10-24 seperate warheads that will split apart and hit 10-24 different targets nearly simultaneously.
t1_dsoge57	1	*	I took a radar course in college. If you want the physics behind it (which is good to understanding how radar works) then search up radio wave propagation for textbooks on it. 
t1_dsn5t6s	1	*	That's true, it would be. But if you can't compromise that system this is the next best thing.

t1_dsi647u	0	*	You mean your alts?
t1_dslzlem	0	*	Words like RACE have scientific definitions. You don't get to self-identify as shit that you aren't whether you like it or not. So yeah I'm very happy to disregard some idiotic shit like that.

t1_dsmdf5p	0	*	You're adorable

t1_dsqe1lz	0	*	And then the ad hominem signifying the end of real discourse.
t1_dsui7ye	1	*	Ah look, the family made a statement that was right on point.  Exactly the type of outcome I was looking for.
t1_dso5j33	1	*	Your post does not in any way shape or form even engage with the claim that you pretend it does. Sadly Skippy Podestas e-mail about that wedding wont go away that easily.
t1_dtrvl8f	0	*	I didn't say I'd be okay with that. Plus the Irish and Saudis have not been fighting forever like the Jews and Muslims so it's a weird forced comparison. 
t1_dt189dz	0	*	I don't think the technical term mattered to the people the state has massacred. Just as I don't think it matters to the people the state is currently oppressing

t1_dt1sdkc	0	*	social revolution
t1_dt1fjjt	0	*	Yes clicking once to validate your own assumptions based on a perfectly acceptable source of truth is exhausting.  Go blog about it.
t1_dt1dklc	0	*	I'm from the US. You can respond to all of Greggers points to me.

t1_dtqqwmi	1	*	It tries so hard, and fails equally as hard. I just really hate Nanaimo what can I say.  People who move there because Victoria is too expensive, mostly, to answer your question.
t1_duid3ur	1	*	I'm being snarky about his attacking your position because it's exactly the sort of thing creationists do toward radioisotope dating and the fossil record.
t1_duhyp9y	0	*	I can think of [one classic example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee).
t1_dtcu61d	1	*	And whataboutism? Capitalism is only in the US? How about norway with their freedom, democracy, free healthcare and high living standard.

t1_duqsrn4	0	*	So for clarification, you do not believe that god is all knowing/all powerful?
t1_dt49tjp	0	*	No. Youre wrong. Vaping is the recommended delivery method but smoking is quite acceptable.
t1_dt49skl	1	*	No. There was no violation. Thats kinda the point of frustration by rental property owners.
t1_dut0pnd	0	*	No, but it doesn't mean people should stop trying to make it better
t1_dtk3by3	0	*	One person? That is your idea of large scale? On that exact day more people were murdered by white men. Does this mean that white men are the most evil people on the planet?  No. 
t1_dttnosf	0	*	what do you think fucking 2K will pay for? Nothing. Its why UHC doesnt work unless you just fuck over well to do people.
t1_dte2ecb	0	*	...Which you know because you know him personally.
t1_dtdae60	0	*	It means that his opinions are as uninformed and as stupid as they seem. It's not an act, he really is that dumb. 
t1_dtd5u9t	1	*	you do know that the only reason why is because states almost unanimously told trump to go suck a dick and decided to ratify it on their own accord anyway, right?
t1_dtgbugt	1	*	I got your sarcasm. I'm saying that big companies moving their labor overseas is globalist bullshit. I have no interest in outsourcing american jobs and creating wage slaves in other countries.
t1_dtfle1h	0	*	Dams and levees aren't currently relevant? There are places in the world where the water is rising my a foot and a half a year...
t1_dsr41pd	0	*	Coooool. I didn't need cosmetic surgery to achieve that but you do you. 
t1_dt9mz22	0	*	Well, by that admission youre not really any less responsible for sexism towards women than the men youre pointing fingers at, so pipe down.

t1_dtev8wz	0	*	http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/10865650/How-much-energy-does-a-web-search-use.html As I already mentioned thats what they say. If you believe them or not is another matter.

t1_dsgpd4a	0	*	47 countries are part of the ECHR. You just understand that ECHR is different than EU. Russia is not part of EU and didn't pay shit.
t1_dtd3180	0	*	But its not about how long you live but the quality of your life.  We both want good lives.  However, a life filled with medications, constant exhaustion and medical bills is not a good time.

t1_duq2lnq	1	*	Why me, I don't do meddling. You can sanction Russia all you'll like. It's worthless. 
t1_dtp4nq1	1	*	right - they also overhauled the airframe but both of those procedures were to extend the service life of the aircraft, not significantly improve it's flight performance or characteristics.

t1_dtefm95	0	*	the title literally says kurds accuse turks of dropping napalm.  serious question, do you believe this is true? do you also believe turkey dropping  agent orange is true?
t1_dsqr8yo	1	*	I don't understand how it's illogical to consider important events that people want to see news nor have you laid out a very convincing case proving otherwise, but uh okay you're welcome I guess.
t1_dsuze96	1	*	We're also not likely to change our habits dramatically in any short amount of time.
t1_dusmqmr	1	*	You replied to the wrong person i think. How is that a human right violation?
t1_dusnv2s	0	*	You ignored the part about the wealth gap (again).  If you want to cover your ears and ignore the current, don't pull some bullshit about how you're only worried about the current.
t1_duulk1m	0	*	I'm a 40 year old man having fun bro. Lighten up. 
t1_dtttnix	0	*	Since these issues have basically nothing to do with gun laws, and are never brought up in the context of gun law debate, I don't really see how that's the case.
t1_duld6ib	0	*	And here we see how the typical Duterte supporter behaves.    I hope you become more knowledgeable about politics in the future.  I really mean that.

t1_dv39kyf	0	*	I see you don't refute or deny the charge.
t1_dtfh839	1	*	There is not one iota of evidence that Russia affected our elections. The burden of proof is not on me. 
t1_dsojgii	1	*	No it isn't. Attacking them for it was the act of war.

t1_dswcri4	0	*	It's not like they can just choose under which country to enter the Olympics... 
t1_dsdsbfd	0	*	That was my point all along... compared to Quatar and saudi arabia Israel is a shoplifter. Did you miss that?
t1_dsev1fc	1	*	Look, we agree on that point. My argument is that calling it something other than what it is just creates division and solves nothing. 
t1_dsdptff	1	*	Fair enough. We can be friends now.

t1_dsuhpfo	0	*	Thanks for this. How come the US amd China themselves aren't in a stare of war with each other, though? Did the Korean War count as a policing action *a la* Cold War style to the two powers?
t1_dsdbwcn	1	*	Get on it. 'The Young Pope' but just slightly different. I'd love that!

t1_ds5z8pe	1	*	Dude, you're so embarrassing. The people I have met from Pakistan are the most honest motherfuckers I have ever met. Maybe the change in /u/RoastedCashew's view of us changes with you? 
t1_dtb6b1p	1	*	Thread of the day right here.
t1_dsdbfbb	1	*	> white boys like you  
t1_dtygsz4	1	*	I don't think you're a fascist, though the second bit sounds accurate.    I will also add that your calling him a racist was in no way 'equally absurd'.
t1_duycal8	0	*	No, it's likely to be higher than 10% when you add in wage stagnation, inflation, vat and anything else like labour costs and interest rates. 
t1_duxte9j	0	*	You're the one with nothing but hateful, downvoted comments. Get outta here you filthy troll.  Again show some evidence, nut up or shut the fuck up.
t1_duzmtxw	1	*	Nah.  I didn't ignore that.
t1_duzsifr	1	*	Would it not of been better to allow US investors to continue to extend credit to CITGO so Rosneft couldn't place the lien against them?
t1_ds9y4u3	0	*	So then its suffice to say that you do understand that every person in the US is afforded constitutional protections then.
t1_du3wmqs	0	*	It's very interesting to read up on, believe it or not I actually know how it works (gasp)  But keep thinking that LOL
t1_duqh6ws	0	*	> your only argument is, I lived in Ukraine once,  
t1_dun4alu	0	*	That was never my narrative?   >The key takeaway in this is the Russians do not care who is the American president, as long as American government is non-functional.
t1_dtssjro	1	*	Yes I understand thats a possibility. Atheists are often discriminated against. I will stick to places I am accepted. Thats why I avoid former confederate states.  I still have freedom of speech.
t1_dun0j1f	1	*	Watch this, it will probably won t change.your mind but you will still laugh  https://youtu.be/0rR9IaXH1M0
t1_dtn4bfh	0	*	You mean you looked on fox and breitbart and couldn't find it? shocking. Google harder. 
t1_dulpqi0	0	*	You think of yourself as smart.  But you are labeling everyone who thinks slightly differently as a fascist.  So maybe you should ask that question to yourself first, before asking it to others.
t1_dtagdrx	0	*	Still havent provided examples of trump not cooperating with the investigation.  Arguing he had wanted to fire mueller isnt an example.    
t1_dsb1a5v	1	*	I did, no numbers or statistics. Just links to more Wikipedia and journalist articles.
t1_dsb7o1b	0	*	Who said they had 30 years in government? They could have had any combination of jobs.
t1_dv7027r	1	*	Have you read all 37 pages? It does suggest that their actions *included* supporting Trump and disparaging Clinton, however they were charged with fraud.

t1_du28t9m	0	*	Jesus Christ......grow the fuck up.
t1_du39apr	1	*	You people being who? I'm seriously asking, people who think Trump and everyone who supports him are shitstains? Because that is, as per more actual evidence, most of the world's population. 
t1_du2ad2m	1	*	Your argument is lame.
t1_du2dwep	0	*	Says the person so blinded by rage that you wrote two seperate replies to the same comment. 
t1_du1njp3	0	*	People do as they're instructed under threat of violence, ruin or other coercion.

t1_dsf7q52	1	*	Aggression. Wow. Jokes are now aggression.
t1_dut7r5g	0	*	Do you have an actual point to make? I've no interest in discussing the discussion, that's a little too meta for me.

t1_dsklfwj	0	*	Nice!  Computer Science and Engineering, with focus on Software Engineering.
t1_dslt8uj	1	*	Correct, it is not. Thats not my concern; thats exactly what I think should happen. My concern is the actual suppression of speech because someone made a decision that they dont like it.
t1_dtqbg07	1	*	I'd roll my eyes harder but I can't. This just in: leaders of criminal syndicates don't carry out their own hits.  Won't someone rid me of this troublesome priest?
t1_dtc1bpr	1	*	Only if they're still a child.    EDIT: [OP was born in the US... I wonder where his mom was then?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zg3d6/iama_23_year_old_entrepreneur_born_in_california/)

t1_dtzs985	1	*	Ouchies, I gots told
t1_dtzbj7a	0	*	It's funny how vehemently you're against third parties and singing praises for Apple.   This kind of absurd brand loyalty is hilarious. 
t1_dtyznmf	0	*	To be fair, I don't know a single person who takes Alex Jones seriously, and I live in a very conservative town.
t1_du0jdja	0	*	Not repeated? It's my understanding that mocking him was a regular part of his routine.

t1_dtomymv	0	*	It was the only political party that was permitted to exist under Franco. The others that Franco turned to were still Falangists, just members of a different faction of the same party.
t1_dtozjpa	0	*	Well, the Union had to abandon a fort due to the confederacy and holed up at Sumter. And it was mostly food and supplies. The Confederacy was trying to force them out, so...
t1_dt95pn4	1	*	insert slow clap 
t1_dw5mjgf	0	*	You made a specific claim, could not back it up, and have resorted to finding a single pro life rep instead. you don't even remember the claim you made anymore do you?
t1_dv3lzbr	0	*	I don't really understand why you are defending / avoid admitting that she gave a bad answer to a good real question. What do you think of Trump as a speaker? 
t1_dujx8qz	1	*	How am I from TD? I'm from Michigan, weird stalker dude.
t1_duohosb	1	*	Good that we can at least agree on that.
t1_dujprp4	0	*	He is an obvious troll. Don't feed it
t1_dujyqm3	0	*	Looking through your history, it's very weird that you call people child and boy a lot. Do you have a thing for children or something? No normal adult I know speaks this way. Should you be on a List?
t1_duk77iq	1	*	 No I said like the only. But if you change the definition of like to literally you would be right.
t1_dtjoxd9	0	*	It sounds similar to dreidel so its probably true.
t1_dtjagt5	0	*	I am completely happy with a circumcized penis and most men like me are. I request all uncircumcised brothers to not be too salty about it.   
t1_dtj67b9	0	*	>You can, it just wont be as good.  I am sure it's better
t1_dv0gpgo	0	*	Judging by the large number of people who answered yes to the do you have a gun in your house before being asked what they think of gun laws, id say no, that's probably not why.

t1_dv5rxdm	1	*	Seriously. In what way or form can you justify gun ownership unless you hunt for a living? That's the only conceivable edge case I can think of. 
t1_ds2kykn	0	*	Sounds more like bronze age nonsense to me. 
t1_dulxair	1	*	That's not what I said at all.
t1_ds3vx54	1	*	Sure

t1_ds4f6q1	1	*	This is only for chief. Parliaments and all else will differ. 
t1_ds5gd40	0	*	Since you seem to shoot down every single use of the word race, and since this is more than a sport than an actual debate I'm interested in, do enlighten us what your definition of race is.
t1_dsca88u	0	*	If I was to drive, the car trip would more likely be for a vacation. Cars are really optional.  OTOH, most people with cars tend to use them for work, and fly only for a vacation.
t1_dv1rkm7	0	*	Well considering his ego, I'm not sure if he'd be relieved. I definitely would be, though. :)
t1_dv2627t	1	*	Unfortunately, that side of the fence is 50/50. The old fogies taught their grandkids to be racist, redneck, and religious.....

t1_dtzut3h	0	*	You would, but would they 2000 years ago? 1000 years ago? Would a farmer be disturbed? A hunter? 
t1_dtzmh34	1	*	I wasn't criticizing, I was asking for clarification.
t1_dtzuk9r	0	*	Even toddlers have a less-skewered understanding of empathy than you seem to have. I hope you're just trolling. Regardless, I'm not going to continue answering your asinine questions.

t1_dtoo9ec	0	*	Nice emotion. Respond with reasoning, excluding your leftist emotions. 
t1_dtp9wxd	0	*	The American people are sheep. They're comfortable, rich, working. It's like the Romans, they're happy with bread and their spectator sports. The Super Bowl means more to them than any right.

t1_dtnbxtn	0	*	Right, because slavery is equal to smoking pot, you smoked too much of it buddy, You're exactly what you named yourself on this website.
t1_dtnrz9k	0	*	Lol stop being a complete idiot...if I get any calmer Ill have to get a toe tag
t1_dtayxgi	0	*	Yes to both. And one more, because this one sometimes trips people up - you don't need to be online to receive coins.
t1_dszcuwe	0	*	So those things are available elsewhere. If they were *that important* to you, you would seek them out elsewhere. I wonder why you don't? (Hint: I know)
t1_dsz3luv	1	*	> Why does that not fit your definition of slavery?  It does. Let's lobby for even less government, I'll march right alongside you.

t1_duxjt0c	0	*	Jesus... okay buddy, whatever you say. 
t1_dsjutag	0	*	I like how once you realized that you were wrong, you did everything in your power to avoid being put in a position where you would be required to admit it.
t1_dsizllc	1	*	Things are newsworthy only because people want to read / hear about them. No other reason. People clearly want to hear about this, hence it is newsworthy.

t1_dt8wk3h	1	*	Can't wait ahaha 
t1_dt8vioe	0	*	I guess the hope is that the increase in workforce for solar *manufacturing* will more than make up for the loss in workforce in *installation,* although time will tell whether that will work out.
t1_dt8z3yn	1	*	Are you making a distinction between legal hate speech and illegal hate speech?  If so, it is not clear.
t1_dtwwd7v	0	*	Tell that to Trump.
t1_dtz33en	0	*	America is a wealthy country as well. Im not sure why you brought it into the equation when we were discussing Norway.
t1_du250km	0	*	Except every one.   Even the Jeff Sessions led Justice Department, says there's no merit to the story.   What am I supposed to do with that information?

t1_duamkyi	0	*	The dude literally admitted he's ill informed. What are you on about?
t1_dum8y0f	0	*	>Other countries dont have this problem  If you use that incredibly loose definition, they do. They'll get mad at you for bringing it up for trying to distract from the real issue.
t1_dumbhcn	1	*	That has nothing to do with anything. Other countries could have 0 gun violence and it would still make it a very misleading fact to present.
t1_dtrgx1k	0	*	I consider white suprematist groups in same league as Hezbollah.  Some people openly sympathise and support them without realising theyre supporting a terrorist-lite organisation.

t1_duqqzj8	0	*	I'm a lukewarm Blues fan tbh  We disagree entirely politically (and I'm assuming in many other ways) but you're at least not being obtuse and rude in this conversation. 
t1_dtmgpoh	0	*	Perhaps, but framing it as jews vs muslim was dishonest. It was very much just muslims vs any other religious groups.

t1_dtwxkdr	1	*	Jerusalem! The site of your new embassy! :D
t1_dtelpxb	0	*	Except there is no quotation of this. I guess you just imagined him saying this?

t1_du7cvqp	0	*	Well since the War on Terrorism is as vague and never ending as the War on Drugs or the War on Poverty, sounds like the US found a great loop hole to keep people locked up forever without a trial.

t1_dsli1b4	0	*	That's fucking ridiculous. Every business I've had to pay would either do it by Bpay or direct bank deposit. The idea of having to pay 30 bucks to pay someone is fucking insane.

t1_dsx18at	0	*	Ever heard of whataboutism?  Yeah, pointing out different problems doesn't actually make Trump a better person, or president.

t1_dusfogj	0	*	I have not stated my beliefs here. I am asking you to explain how you justify your beliefs in innate rights. This should be simple. 
t1_dur7cql	0	*	>No, it comes out to 0.00002, which is not the same as as 0.00002%.  Lol can you even understand the dumb shit you're typing? 
t1_durm9bw	0	*	 > >(checks history) > >Ah. That explains it. A non US teenager who plays too much online video games. Explains your attitude *perfectly.*  I was wondering when you'd resort to ad hominem. 
t1_dtzf56f	0	*	> The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim.  Then I eagerly await your proof that nothing happens after death.
t1_dt2l1me	1	*	Then what do you want a wall for?
t1_dui3psz	0	*	All claims and no evidence.
t1_dui43vn	1	*	I'm going to mock the person who replied to me by using quotes to make it seem like this is what they were saying aloud before typing! Haha, let's see how you like it! 
t1_duijcin	1	*	Spot on. 
t1_duifize	1	*	So it would have been fine if we limited the number of EU2 migrants coming to the UK?
t1_dui6t4d	0	*	If all men dropped out it would destroy industries that depend on heavy labor. Plus thats not happening at all at least in the US
t1_du06zoy	1	*	lol 
t1_dtsv6c2	0	*	So you flee from facts while spouting your own trite shit. Where have I seen this before...
t1_dspqmq3	0	*	So you just want to hide the truth from people you don't deem worthy of knowing it or who have beliefs you don't agree with?   I'm sure that line of thinking will never cause any problems. 
t1_dserhmi	0	*	If it doesn't the full term condition still applies, Carter was never re-elected.

t1_dstu6y2	1	*	Pleasure.  Upvote in the usual place. Knock yourself out 
t1_ds70ru1	0	*	Honestly, I think you are just a little sensitive about me asking.  I recalled it in the news and asked my question in a fair way.  Rephrase it more neutrally for me.
t1_dunipw8	0	*	You're really awful at arguing. Sorry that society has forced you to use the internet rather than using a quill and courier. Technological advancements happen, stagnating helps no one. 
t1_ds7ka8x	1	*	God damn it reddit.
t1_duk8ltm	1	*	*You* brought up FGM. In what way did I start it?
t1_duy8425	1	*	Laws operate and different ways and suicides are not always successful. Guns make it very easy and other methods often fail. This may be used to force said person into rehabilitation f.ex.
t1_duysyev	1	*	I think most people reading the chain would infer that when you started to argue with the guy who simply said:  >I didn't think Germany was contender for leader on morality 
t1_du8qqjl	0	*	So it's better to claim great insurance doesn't exist?
t1_ds9v88p	0	*	> You're equally incredulous over the Trump/Russia accusations, I trust. Right?  That was an awfully quick change of subject.

t1_dtq6rzg	0	*	Israel is nit in charge of Palestinian land, even if it thinks so
t1_du4yks9	0	*	Why are you participating in this discussion? I'd expect at least a rudimentary grasp of the facts of someone who chooses to do so.
t1_dsxb22c	0	*	We are objectively better at some things and objectively worse at other things. Indiscriminate judgement of this sort doesn't really mean anything.
t1_duxp1fd	1	*	Indeed, but so...? They are exceptions, no longer the norm.
t1_dv4643j	0	*	Id prefer to ask what the EU citizens would have spent it on. I think they would have spent it in their interest better than the EU on their behalf. Different strokes, I guess.
t1_duv34xh	0	*	Okay.  For example the genetic predisposition to alcoholism at an increased rate among certain races.
t1_dv5rvcm	1	*	Sure, but what infrastructure they include is not up to them, the local government (municipality) decides that.
t1_ds36but	0	*	Did... You just try to pivot this bull shit into saying blacks are genetically stupid...what the fuck is the matter with you?
t1_dt3r95d	0	*	Haha, well, as you're obsessed with definitions lately, you can now update your own understanding of the definition of genocide.   Cheers

t1_dsb5fer	1	*	Intentionally, huge difference there..of course it's happened but it used to be rare until Syria. They hit hospitals nearly as much as homes now. 
t1_dt32fha	1	*	http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17512040  But if you factor in purchasing power parity that number goes way up, which is why even in developing countries they can afford modern comforts. 
t1_dudfsjz	0	*	Saying this isn't utopian doesn't stop it from being so. 
t1_dtevpj5	0	*	Because the US is the cause for most of the refugees currently fleeing war but refuses to help them.
t1_dsdbwg7	1	*	Go on....
t1_dsxopsd	0	*	Again, not a right winger - just someone with some common sense.   Also, your 100k number is made up. $2.4T/37.2M = 64,516.
t1_dse0gi1	1	*	Finland's main advantage in the winter war was the terrain favoring defense. All that terrain was ceded to the soviet union after the war. Territory that Russia now holds.
t1_dsbyp10	0	*	You continue to believe that. The evidence Ive seen is very much on my side.
t1_dsc4d34	0	*	I'm not concerned with personal pride, I'm just happy to help you in your confidence with English, and I hope you continue to learn ;)

t1_dv02npe	0	*	Just because something is not in the constitution doesnt mean is not illegal lol
t1_duzz1xi	0	*	Well that isn't good at all. Definitely don't agree with it, but given the forces that Cuba has had to defend itself from it's understandable to do such things. 
t1_dv05ogl	0	*	Yes.   Feel free to explain how my metaphors are inappropriate, as I have explained how yours were - I see no issue with mine.
t1_dv05y2k	1	*	Yeah, but the current Cons are going towards American rightwing style of politics, and I doubt he's into that...
t1_duzzm6l	1	*	Obligatory user name checks out

t1_dsvadiw	0	*	I'm not falling for anything. From my perspective it seems like youve realized you have no argument and now you're resorting to it was all an elaborate troll to save your ego. 
t1_dsyck0m	1	*	the truth hurts
t1_dv0sbae	0	*	You didnt even know what Occams razor was until I explained it to you. You think attacks that **only** happen in Cuba are Russian and Im the one bending over backwards...sure thing.

t1_dsh7irg	0	*	Yes this was recent and it was out of self defense. 
t1_duxnxvn	1	*	I mean, it makes it pretty clear that sexual sin is a serious offense about God, so it doesn't ignore it 
t1_dt6cyov	1	*	Awesome news. Some european countries have already done this including Sweden.  
t1_dsjncnv	0	*	See what happens when you run out of things to parrot? You stop bringing up new points for discussion. Talk about propaganda lol.

t1_duz8jmg	1	*	Evidence says no. Unless Hillarys campaign collided knowingly as well.
t1_dsrm2iq	0	*	Agreed. I only used RyanAir when I had to. I liked EasyJet and Vueling significantly more. Ive never used the others that you mentioned though.
t1_dura0qs	0	*	*Passive aggressive comment to feed the troll some more*

t1_duv7l3b	0	*	obama can kill any one, pretty sure he is not raping michelle
t1_dv4wl0l	1	*	What goal posts. Your argument is that a democracy can't have different people balanced differently, however that is incorrect. Just because you're wrong doesn't mean I'm moving the goal posts
t1_dv4jvk5	0	*	Im saying you dont know how it would play out. Youre just making up numbers and stating them as fact. Its okay to say you dont know bud. 
t1_dudqgji	0	*	Regional powers somehow translate to world powers in your book?  You're comparing Brazil to the USSR during the cold War, essentially. 
t1_dthizuj	0	*	This isnt an anti israel story. Its an israel story. A true one. One about the DISGUSTING behavior of a shitty oppressive racist regime.  Ugh. You apologists have no morality nor shame.
t1_dtkk8ms	0	*	Israel doesnt demolish schools to protect anybody.  Explain how that is the case.  Do it NOW  NOW.

t1_ds20xnc	0	*	Ive read it and remain unconvinced. Please cite which part you think exonerates a call for genocide.
t1_dt2ulzu	0	*	It's not. I'm saying it doesn't matter. Did you have a point you were trying to make?
t1_dt2nby6	0	*	I can't decide.  Will post now and edit in 2019 with my answer.

t1_dv51flg	0	*	So we should kill all white Americans (the ones that invaded America and killed all the natives)
t1_du88mmu	0	*	I never used the term negotiation. A judge deciding the sentence for a guilty party doesn't negotiate either, but they don't always decide on the maximum possible sentence.
t1_dt1dovf	1	*	It wouldn't be, If my mother had decided she didn't want to carry me to term it wouldn't be murder at all
t1_dtbspad	0	*	What did he do that was fascist? Gave poor people healthcare? Fixed the economy? Didnt take any guns?  You are not even a good troll.

t1_dsn7eje	0	*	Who in he world would store an acid in a vessel it would react to? Thats chemistry 101.
t1_duly9cf	1	*	Considering they investigate themselves? Most people would probably pay good money for that privilege.
t1_dsa9srd	1	*	How am I not making sense? Speech is not violence.
t1_dtmyy8v	0	*	In reality Joseph impregnated Mary and Mary was in fact a child at the time. Nobody talks about that because Christian religious doctrine insists Mary was a virgin, but we all know thats bullshit. 
t1_dsoyynj	0	*	I don't know if that is sarcasm, but if it isn't, thanks for the compliment. But, I definitely am nowhere near perfect.
t1_dupd6zv	0	*	That was a proposal, my dude. 
t1_dtjr0rt	0	*	allright, you worry about semantics, the adults will concern ourselves with elected/prospective representatives threatening people with illegal detention and torture.  Have fun buddy.
t1_dtkervq	0	*	All out brawl would mean that both the US and the Europe would be decimated by nuclear arms, if you have 1000 or 10 000 atom bombs there is a little difference.
t1_ds4ippd	0	*	Must everything be about Trump?
t1_ds2b1pd	1	*	Lmao dude I agreed with you at first but at this point he's right, you're just desparate to have the last word at any cost to the point you originally tried to make. 
t1_dtejqwb	1	*	Epik troll bro
t1_dutvz3f	0	*	Very good, well thought out argument
t1_dt1e73x	0	*	The other poster was right, you really are delusional. Please talk with a psychiatrist or other medical professional for help before you try to harm someone.

t1_dtjfhoj	1	*	Indeed. 
t1_dtj9wgq	1	*	If addicts should be put into involuntary mental asylums, should they be provided with resources to avoid relapse or support themselves after breaking their physical addiction?

t1_du75cng	0	*	Israel's established an apartheid state, not that I approve of either side throwing weapons about but if you don't wanna be bombed don't make a second-class citizenry religio-ethnostate a thing...
t1_ds22k08	0	*	I mean, I can give you examples of things that are bad and are doing real harm: anti-vaccination movement or neo-nazis. Do you think that banning them would be a bad thing? 
t1_ds1l5d1	0	*	You're assuming I'm American.  Your country has a massive race problem in every aspect of your lives. You can't even talk about anything without bringing it up.
t1_ds1iu3u	1	*	Liveable with increased exposure to cancers, leukemia, birth defects, etc. Not to mention soil and water contamination from fallout. Not an ideal place to live.

t1_ds26ydt	1	*	since trump rolled back Obama's EO that you couldn't fire someone just for being gay 
t1_ds1l7zc	1	*	Trump also has a complex situation in his hands and I never implied otherwise.  All I'm arguing against is the ridiculous both sides are the same nonsense.
t1_ds1tc3m	1	*	I can't change goalposts I didn't set, I also never expected a Clinton administration to pull us out of Afghanistan.  All I'm saying is it would've been significantly less of a shitshow.
t1_ds1gsv8	0	*	How do you feel about fraggle rock?
t1_ds1lzmb	0	*	I don't need to convince anyone - if you want to stay angry over something you have no control over, that's on you.
t1_dtqk1l2	0	*	A racial purist concerned with the well being of native and aboriginal peoples.   Thats some delicious concern trolling, friend. 
t1_dtpwk18	1	*	That is indeed more reasonable. I personally like using a VPN simply for peace of mind, I'd probably still use it even if I used private trackers. Always nice to have an extra layer of privacy imo
t1_dso4jha	1	*	I'll try to remember to come back when this has been edited into something coherent.
t1_du37rwl	0	*	what scares me is how little anyone gives a damn about personal responsibility anymore. We're being downvoted for suggesting people learn to drive defensively.
t1_dv08v4s	0	*	Arguing that your opponent is unrealistic or naive is an admittance of defeat - you did both. Bravo! 
t1_dta7fjx	0	*	So your argument for defense...   that you didn't make a grammatical error...  Is that you edited the prior post for a completely different grammatical error?
t1_dtabkvp	0	*	So if I start a party with the intent to kill all white people and I actively encourage that would that be fine?
t1_dtapi6q	0	*	Judges in germany are employed by the government so the government does decide. Also since when was personal honor a right?
t1_dszv11s	0	*	You proved me wrong with anecdotal observations lol?  If you don't understand why this means literally nothing, you're honestly not worth any sort of conversation.
t1_du8knby	0	*	Any contaminated air is gonna cause repository problems or potentially asphyxiation. Nice job using Vice as a source too, that would go down a storm in peer review.
t1_duqgbsr	1	*	You too, have fun with your small victories that amount to nothing. See you in 2020 while Rachel maddow bawls at another Trump election because the dems put another Kerry up for election.
t1_duqbcjp	0	*	Considering I legally cannot own 2 pistols I would say yes my right to bear arms is infringed.

t1_dskpn1m	0	*	Well actually, others miss bush too, but its not logical; its the result of the trauma of living under trump.
t1_dskr650	0	*	Right because by specifying American left I conflated international affairs with American politics.  Exercise reading comprehension, it makes you look smart and you certainly get off on feeling smart.

t1_dt0tg56	1	*	While charity is admirable essential social services and the creation of equal opportunities should not depend on it. Society must take full responsibility and be accountable.

t1_duyyoyg	0	*	You made a claim but can not supply any evidence to back it up. 
t1_duyqfpw	0	*	I'd love to. Just redact your name, obviously. 
t1_dsxu7xl	0	*	> Yeah, my comments saying most of us hate our government is soooo nationalistic.  That's clearly disingenuous as literally everything else you write is about how much better you are.

t1_dslf4zh	1	*	I'll agree with that. 
t1_dsl3v9a	1	*	Lol 7 years.

t1_ds83mdd	0	*	You seem biased lol
t1_dscrkr4	0	*	You need to back up your bullshit stats.
t1_dsc2a69	0	*	Because his feelings are hurt... that doesn't mean he should take factual errors as correct.  That's one of the biggest issues facing us  feelings>facts.   I am tired of both sides to be honest. 
t1_dscfpv9	0	*	No one's making you have sex with immigrants.  
t1_dscfnjk	1	*	Why are you responding to my comment mocking you for overgeneralizing muslims by saying you and the op were generalizing muslims?
t1_dsc4atw	0	*	Oh I see then so you're just against religion? (abrahamic at least).Thought your argument was about 'identity' and change.

t1_duh60hb	0	*	So what about non-American sources that don't really have an interest in our party politics?  You seem to think American news sources have no value to them, do you think this has always been the case?
t1_dugs8nz	0	*	That article said yes,  the campaign financing is true, the DNC was all biased to Hillary as well, but look it probably didn't matter.  Cool I feel way better about our Democratic process, thanks
