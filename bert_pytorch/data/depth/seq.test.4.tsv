t1_ds96njt	1	*	Well, yeah, even is just a synonym we give to numbers divisible by 2 because it's occasionally useful.       All primes (except for X) are not divisible by X   Is true for all primes
t1_ds9ckql	1	*	Just like cryptomining with a pretty good gpu U0001f60a

t1_dullgk2	0	*	No they did not, Italy, Greece and Hungary let them into the EU, Germany just helped their European neighbours.
t1_dulvajy	1	*	> Being voted the best country in the world for several years in a row  Woah what. Slow down there. That's not true. 
t1_dulv9l8	1	*	Wouldn't the identity thieves also be in the criminal group?  That means 14-6-1 = 7 that were neither criminal nor dangerous.

t1_dsspdcu	0	*	Yeah, I used to be pro-Turkey (well not pro, but tolerated) just because they gave us a base in the Middle East, but after the bullshit in Washington they can kick rocks.

t1_dv6286y	0	*	I'm saying Republicans are lying and using Russia's interference in the elections as an excuse to attack protests.
t1_dv55njg	0	*	That's assuming their efforts have any influence at all. I think it's more that they latch onto to popular topics to build up accounts / sock puppets.

t1_dun7whr	1	*	From what I read the guy wasn't even at his post. Better to have a person defending each class than some guy at the front of the school.
t1_dswvp1m	1	*	I would also assume that as the country develops some potential parents decide not to have kids in favor of work. As in all developed countries

t1_ds3o82j	0	*	So when rebels are rioting violently on the street and attacking police stations and military bases for weapons, the govt should stand down and let them do it or the govt is at fault here. Gotcha.  
t1_ds2zxz3	1	*	There's still internet in Iran. A lot of sites/apps are blocked, but that's *always* the case in Iran, so most people already use VPNs to get around it.

t1_dutmzeb	0	*	How does one find out, except for the hard way?  The children who have been killed by vaccines and their parents definitely did it by just vaccinating. 
t1_dutfp94	1	*	Some people, for whatever reason, can't be vaccinated, and rely on the rest of us for herd immunity.

t1_duu238k	0	*	You should probably get that booster shot. You don't want to be suspended too long, your grades will drop. 
t1_duti44x	1	*	You should be pushing harder for vaccinations then. You being **medically** unable to get it are put increasingly at risk because dipshits refuse to get it done.

t1_dutcdza	1	*	I think his statement was pretty all inclusive 
t1_dutqv9c	0	*	Reddit is tolerant except for fucking bigots who don't deserve to be heard and people who openly and willingly kill theirs and others children

t1_duu3tt8	0	*	Funny.  I got downvoted for pointing that out... you got upvoted.  Perhaps im just an asshole in my delivery..
t1_duvfz2n	0	*	id like to see evidence of that, considering 2016 was a MAJOR outlier
t1_dutuyzo	1	*	So what you're saying is as vaccination rates have dropped autism rates have increased. So vaccinations actually help prevent autism. 
t1_dutlzhc	0	*	So what your saying is a vaccine basically prevents you from getting the mumps, but you can still get the mumps because somebody else gave you the mumps. Nice.

t1_dutqxfd	1	*	do measles cause autism, tho?
t1_duu1dus	1	*	Kids of parents who have Rubella are more likely to have Autism. Its one of many things that could happen, death and physical disabilities among them.
t1_dutpqcc	0	*	Thats why mandatory vaccinations (for those who can safely have them) should be a thing. That way, we dont have to reduce immigration and we increase protection against diseases.
t1_duu8h5k	1	*	I know you're joking (tho its true), but they probably do have a lower risk of being diagnosed with autism because their parents clearly dont trust doctors
t1_dutjd2u	1	*	The story about refugees and vaccinations is typical right wing propaganda without any proof. 
t1_dutjplr	1	*	Which is why you want others to get vaccinations. When those who are able to get vaccinated to a disease that helps your chance of not getting that specific disease.  Herd immunity
t1_dutmy2i	1	*	Sheeeet, nowadays, if you stare off into space for a moment as a child, you have some form of autism.
t1_duts92v	1	*	You need to do you homework.  What he is saying is wrong.  Japan just doesnt do the triple shot.  The gives vaccinations on separate shots.   Still getting them.
t1_dutp5i9	1	*	Its not just a spectrum thing because kids in the 90s and earlier didn't have the behavioral problems that kids today have.
t1_dutm9n6	0	*	Of course they are most likely to be white though, they make up the majority. Are there any stats for unvaccination among immigrants/refugees?

t1_dv49tjd	0	*	The length of the 100M cable run fluctuates THAT much?!   What sort of speeds do you get?
t1_dv49u6w	1	*	eastern european?
t1_dv4f5p6	1	*	it might. but frankly a little honesty wouldn't hurt much in the internet industry.
t1_dv4lkt1	1	*	You should pay by use.  If you use 100MiB at 10Mb/s download you should pay a little less than someone who used 100MiB at 20Mb/s download. 
t1_dv4c00y	1	*	Wow, you should immediately move to Romania. ~9/month for a 1000 Mbps connection.
t1_dv4buwt	1	*	Is that the same guy who told someone to move closer to the city if they want NBN   After promising nbn would connect the entire country 
t1_dv4cb8x	1	*	Are you getting 6mbps or 6MBps?
t1_dv49kdt	0	*	I live in a third world country and even I got your ass beat
t1_dv4assp	1	*	Right... The NBN is borrowing the funds to pay for it from the government, which will in turn be paid back by customers. It's a shithouse model, I'd preffer higher taxes but there ya go. 
t1_dv4f3hf	0	*	Fuck you - all of America 
t1_dv48o0g	1	*	If you have more money than the other guy to pay for lawyers it is.
t1_dv673l8	1	*	Well Rupert Murdoch (big donator to the Liberal Party) & Telstra's cable network, yes. 
t1_dv49huo	1	*	Do they not have a speed checker in Australia? Whenever I look at a new provider I can check my lines to see what speeds I am capable of
t1_dv4d6uu	1	*	You cannot really guarantee it tho. There is so much that can influence your speed. too many people using the same knot. Weather (in some cases)   The distance to your home 
t1_dv4a1vm	1	*	> We are an island  You what, mate. Aus is a continent.  Hell, NZ is made up of islands, but we have network speeds that make you look like you're still on dial up.
t1_dv4d6jv	1	*	On the business side they do, but you pay more for the privilege.
t1_dv4dfev	1	*	We have -25c and a meter of snow. Welcome!
t1_dv4ita4	0	*	Did you still get the 47 megs down even after they changed the official max speed? 
t1_dv4i6ci	1	*	If that could be made into a workable system it would even more teeth than the proposed fines! I'd love for ISPs to have to supply the internet equivalent of the baker's dozen!
t1_dv4gq3i	1	*	It's same in Slovenia. Dumbly enough, before they laid fiber to my house, it was cheaper to get 4/1mbps with TV and telephone than 2/512 with telephone, since that was the max speed I could get.
t1_dv4c9a3	1	*	Just signed up with Telstra Cable. Been two days and speeds are already at approximately 2-6Mbps. Goddamn cunts. 
t1_dv49qjs	0	*	Romania?
t1_dv4anem	0	*	Paying telstra an extra $20 for 100mbps, gets 60...
t1_dv49a51	1	*	Something, something Eastern Europe internet?
t1_dv4h1t7	0	*	Thats still unlimited. They dont say you get max speed for entire unlimited. 
t1_dv48apz	1	*	Don't forget that Labors NBN was originally FTTN which the National Party (Specifically Fiona Nash) labeled as Fraudband.  
t1_dv66tr8	0	*	Plus traffic is a factor, however, we never get even close to half the speed advertised no matter what time of day.  SO basically lied to by the provider.
t1_dv4hpr6	1	*	Basically you want the internet to be like electricity. You always get the current you need and the correct voltage. Then it is only about the kWh you consume.
t1_dv4aqu0	0	*	half the problem is they have no fucking idea what speed you'll get till they hook you up and see
t1_dv4l6ii	1	*	Amen to that. But all power rests with the rich. 
t1_dv4aqxg	0	*	I take your point, but have you seen a population density map of the US? Out west is a wasteland compared to the coasts. 
t1_dv5v7j7	1	*	Prime minister managed to get 100Mbps to all of his houses.
t1_du4tz1u	1	*	Of course. Im more concerned about the people who dont read those labels. A warning sign might inspire them to make better choices? Maybe. Maybe not.
t1_du4fnan	0	*	Well. They do.
t1_ds57vuc	1	*	did you just assume the gender gap?
t1_ds52r4j	0	*	And that is why wage transparency should be the goal, not equal pay.
t1_ds54yyc	1	*	It's simple.  Any time a man is paid more than a woman it has to be because of sexism.  /s(?)
t1_ds5bmjl	0	*	What's your point?
t1_ds5b613	1	*	Im not willing to go that far. But i will say they are being steered into better paying careers instead of liberal arts careers
t1_ds10a2e	0	*	To the sanctions-mobile!!
t1_ds0yi76	0	*	and Russia. Of course that is what they wanted the entire time.
t1_dulo5t4	0	*	I'm sure the stormtroopers detaining you will be sure to pass along that message.
t1_dulxkra	0	*	Yes, you value your life so much, you got shot while trying to escape. 
t1_dulwt9a	1	*	1. They are well-educated.  2. Despite the Islamic revolution, the elite were able to hang onto their money.
t1_ds6053u	0	*	But what if I point with my thumb?
t1_dt9nzfk	1	*	Butbut he's a traitorist.  (TIL traitorists!!)
t1_dunan0c	0	*	And gaza has a ridiculous obesity rate. Food aint scarce.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317185/
t1_dumw64e	0	*	Exactly. Just want to be able to read 200 books from all angles and gather what I can from a logical manner, if there is one. 
t1_duyejr4	1	*	People with a dark sense of humor, I'm not gonna lie I laughed, it is better to laugh then cry in life.  Roses are red violets are blue lighten up It's not gonna kill you.
t1_dtuk3p5	0	*	We can blame immoral people for acting immorally even if they themselves are not breaking any of their own personal rules. 
t1_dtututd	1	*	You can? Not in my country at least
t1_dtuwnbj	1	*	> fixed dose combination (FDC) antibiotics   Using that in farming sounds like the best way to create the resistant superbugs that will destroy the world.
t1_dst5sht	0	*	Promote religion educations in every school in US, that will show them what freedom looks like!
t1_ds1eb57	0	*	I agree. It was a fantastic comment. 
t1_ds1uh8i	1	*	China is not a developed country. It is *developing.*
t1_ds2qb6r	1	*	ha wicked i did the same haven't bought any for years :D 
t1_dur43gx	1	*	Happy cake day! Ive seen a lot today. I wonder if a lot of you joined on the same day for the same reason 
t1_duqslh5	1	*	That doesn't answer their question, the common cold is viral. 
t1_duqzsue	1	*	When in doubt assume it's an American forgetting the rest of the world exists.
t1_dsmn6op	0	*	Fire them!!  Sue them!!   Americans.
t1_dsmn8ok	1	*	I bet that system is a hell of a lot less hack-susceptible than municipal sirens, for instance.
t1_dsmnh61	0	*	4 minutes, no answer, he ded.
t1_dsmn3n2	0	*	I don't remember the exact quote, but something along the lines of, ...one of the greatest disciplines of the sword is knowing when to unsheathe it....
t1_dsmo1j6	1	*	Fat Boy should launch now.  Everyone would ignore another warning.
t1_dsmp0m6	1	*	Typical American. About to die? Eat some food.
t1_dsmnsw4	1	*	Time to update The boy who cried wolf to The phone that cried ballistic missile 
t1_dsmqd8z	1	*	Kim might have pissed himself but that's about it.
t1_dsmnyzy	1	*	You forgot: yet
t1_dsmn9jt	0	*	a big one.
t1_dsmnfoa	1	*	This is a mistake that shouldn't have been made. The message even said this is not a drill. Idk about you, but I have a lot of family on the Island, and I don't take this lightly.
t1_dtbzorj	1	*	The Turkish would likely have better results with regard to its Kurdish population if it replaced the billy club with an open hand.
t1_dtoehsp	1	*	All hail the proletariat!
t1_dtpjblh	1	*	Yet somehow we have people working two full-time jobs here in America. 
t1_dtokgnk	0	*	America is not the only country on earth where wages have not kept up with increasing productivity. 
t1_dt34xb3	1	*	The kapos were fed into the ovens along with the rest.
t1_dtj4325	0	*	Most of the meals being sent out were a can of chili, some crackers, and other assorted snacks.  Not the standard MRE.  
t1_dthro2q	0	*	PREPA, which is owned by the Puerto Rican government, was the one that dropped the ball and awarded a critical contract to a 2 man operation in Montana, which of course turned out to be a disaster.
t1_dtjbrwd	1	*	Think of it like this, if they keep trying to take aid from the government that takes away aid that will be needed when other states get into trouble, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires etc.
t1_dtief59	1	*	Some background in the office would be nice. I mean I don't know about you but I would prefer it if people on the education board had some measure of experience dealing with, you know, education.
t1_dtis8i5	1	*	> Loans are being withheld by the federal govt, despite their approval by congress.  Because they lied about how much cash they have on hand. 
t1_dtigzjz	0	*	Meanwhile South Africa is about to run out of water...
t1_dtjtbhm	1	*	More like, democracy, you get the government that you deserve.
t1_dthyw54	1	*	You mean like [South Carolina and North Dakota](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-states-are-givers-and-which-are-takers/361668/)? 
t1_du14kvw	1	*	You sound like a Middle East newbie  
t1_du1cweo	0	*	Iron Dome doesn't shoot down drones. The drone was shot down by an attack helicopter.
t1_du0yybb	0	*	Actually it is a really bad trade. One pilot is injured as well.
t1_du1afqd	1	*	I think you meant USA?!  Iran is an integral part of the landscape; it is their back yard to defend.
t1_dub573x	1	*	He didn't say that people should be praying and taking action. You misunderstood what he was saying here.
t1_dub4ya7	0	*	It's also shit they would say like libtard' nothing shuts off consideration and respect faster than a tard suffix 
t1_dtnyud8	1	*	The only evidence we have of him being a good businessman is a reality TV show where he plays the character of a good businessman.
t1_dtnz4h3	0	*	NAFTA is unbalanced. Managing to eliminate trade deficits is what needs to happen with a renegotiation.
t1_dto2k9c	1	*	Good luck on that.
t1_dto2hfq	1	*	Nope. but this puts him in a better position.
t1_dtnxbcd	0	*	>Trump is a huge coward and sucks at making actual deals.  lol
t1_dto55rc	1	*	Ok, as a Mexican, what do you want your country to do?  Just accept any old NAFTA that the USA tells you to??
t1_dtofdx7	1	*	I am willing to meet with the ethics commissioner, as I said before.
t1_dtnz24m	0	*	So what you are saying is Canada first, and that you want to make deals that put Canada first?  So in other words, you feel the same way about Canada, as Trump feels about America.
t1_dtnzqim	0	*	Harper was basically Canada's Pence, only he made it to the top.
t1_dtodgc1	1	*	And Trudeau is a boxer.
t1_dto0mlv	0	*	People (conservatives mostly) love bashing on Trudeau for all sorts of shit but their party is an incompetent mess right now and their ideas are almost entirely counter progress.
t1_dtnxbzi	1	*	You mean the transgendered provisions are so great, amirite?
t1_dto00od	1	*	That's 'cuz after Brexit nobody else wants to do make deals with you :P
t1_dtp9ch7	0	*	I dont recall Trudeau bankrupting several businesses....
t1_dtnxe9i	1	*	Harper was good. Much better than this idiot.
t1_dtnw7cy	1	*	Almost like it's a good policy for a country's leader to take U0001f914
t1_dto0rh4	1	*	IDK if I agree the letter is pathetic. The gist of it seems to be that the proposal should be evaluated on its own merits, not compared to previous proposals.
t1_dtnyvk2	0	*	He doesnt seem to realize how unimportant we are in the grand scheme of things, No dis to Canada but we are not exactly a major global trade juggernaut.... 
t1_dto4f5w	0	*	The things is if you open with $100, the dealer will tell you to get fucked and sells the car to another guy.
t1_dtnxzd4	0	*	? That wouldn't be good for Canada at all 
t1_dtnrpt4	0	*	/s
t1_dtnxr90	0	*	Nice sentiment.   But am I correct in thinking that you don't own a business exporting to the U.S.A.  :)
t1_dtrvfzu	0	*	Trump: Hey, I'll trade you a five dollar bill for a one dollar bill.    You: OK.
t1_dtnzb71	0	*	What?
t1_dtnqs35	1	*	Couldnt be farther from the truth
t1_dtnz1br	1	*	That sounds like Stephen Harper alright.
t1_dtot0xn	1	*	Fuck. Trump. Canada, and Mexico, are our friends and we should have a friendly deal in place. Not some power grab deal.
t1_dtnzpgk	1	*	This will play well with his base though.  They love that shit.
t1_dtnyqba	0	*	And your sources are? 
t1_dto5lxw	1	*	Is that any different from dropping out of the Paris climate treaty because of getting a bad deal? 
t1_dto1bs9	0	*	As someone whose livelyhood depends 100% on NAFTA, I'd rather it go untouched than pulled...
t1_dto4zsv	1	*	Just wake up from a coma? 
t1_dto4xvp	1	*	Even more depressing, a lot of commenters here also think it's the same. That, or they're trolls.
t1_dtnx6ch	1	*	Who are you talking about? 
t1_dto3sf9	0	*	Care to explain how so?
t1_dtoaqv6	1	*	At least you're honest about wanting to see the US go down in flames
t1_dtotxka	1	*	Best description yet 
t1_duzr0cm	1	*	I am a meliponist, there are insects that pollinate flowers (flies, beetles, wasps etc.). Granted, bees do the lion's share of pollinating though.
t1_duzeaac	1	*	Honey bees are doing better.  Native bees, at least as the US goes, are not.
t1_dslfphw	1	*	ONE person!
t1_dui9khk	1	*	This isn't even a half-measure & will accomplish virtually nothing.
t1_dt2azwb	1	*	Aside from a Donnie Darko reference Im not sure what that is, so I dont think so. 
t1_dujbr9l	1	*	> quite clear - Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  That's as clear as Brexit means Brexit.
t1_dujdgv4	1	*	Yeah but anything the media can do to make the UK seem super shady gets a lot of Sorosxa9 clicks these days.
t1_dspzkco	1	*	Well its been a decade since gas was about $4 a gallon, there has been plenty of time 
t1_ducdd52	1	*	If more women use Tinder because of this, it's a good thing. I can't see it being that dramatic of a difference but who the hell knows. I dont use Tinder and I'm not bothered by what people say. 
t1_duk7cui	0	*	Which is in Cuba, and has enemy combatants, not American Citizens. The 8th Amendment only applies to citizens and people inside the US. 
t1_duksl9v	0	*	A lot of people struggling with the reading on here. Doesn't inspire much hope. Glad you are not law makers.
t1_dujafko	0	*	According to the article he tried to trick the checkout system, wouldn't a kleptomaniac get a bigger rush of outright stealing it?
t1_dujhs3v	0	*	Like everybody is saying. He makes 24k a month. He isn't poor and won't be broke because of this.
t1_duln6zv	1	*	How much did Putin appropriate? How much money did he have before he was president and how much does he have now? I got the impression he's a billionaire?
t1_dum8yoz	0	*	There are rumours he was falsely convicted. 
t1_dum3k64	1	*	I think he has more support than Sobchak.
t1_dumfxqj	1	*	Yeah, they were never not this in the entire time I've been alive.  Soviet russia and today's russia only says nice things about people for a reason.
t1_dun09p8	1	*	Check this out http://www.citjourno.org/page-1
t1_dunb653	1	*	Nah I think he meant how URSS special service sent back the head of a son of a terrorist group with his own dick in his mouth so the terrorist would release hostages without bargaining. 
t1_dumge3x	1	*	> Ksenia who is an actual troll candidate.   So was Trump.
t1_dummcz0	0	*	But why? Putin is so much fun to see in the news articles. 
t1_dun7p8u	0	*	Don't forget all the times he got caught on xenophobia and racism.  I mean, he literally only has to say I will build a wall. I read his program and it doesn't really answer any questions.
t1_dsbksi2	0	*	china actually has a labor shortage....  http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/360377-china-faces-labor-shortage-rising-wages/ 
t1_dur640m	1	*	Sucks that such an opportunity is being forced upon him. I feel like crying. /s

t1_dtzbnpj	0	*	Seems like we could have improved America 
t1_du05x4i	0	*	Invading wouldn't have been that bad if the US continued the payments to the army. Millions of soldiers were out of work after being promised monthly payments from the US.
t1_dtzyjob	1	*	I dont really see anything wrong with judging our foreign policy by administration. I dont have a problem with your way of judging it, but we simply do it another way. 
t1_dtzqc98	0	*	Deficit spending for wars. Been doing it since 9/11
t1_dtz9wnx	1	*	Thats how you start another *cash flow*
t1_dtz89c6	0	*	Educate yourself about Afghanistan's history before trying to bullshit justify things
t1_dtzg1wl	1	*	Militarily, he's right. The war would be fought almost entirely on Chinese soil.
t1_dtzs5qd	1	*	Actually, the American way is building them up better than before the war. This is the Conservative way.
t1_dsjsnt2	1	*	No overreaction here, just solid clarification.  Well done. 
t1_dsgbe78	0	*	The point of what is being said is hitting on women is ok. Assaulting them is not. Sometimes women don't differentiate.
t1_durjgp4	1	*	Oh my
t1_dus3veq	0	*	Unpopular opinion: civilian massacres were great because it was against a country whose army was bad. (Sitting at 13 upvotes)
t1_dv9ws3b	0	*	Flamethrowers are not allowed to be used on people
t1_duret15	1	*	He's basically saying that Japan are giving the impression that they are innocent victims when in reality they did a lot of truly fucked up shit.
t1_durlxwp	0	*	Do they have English subtitles for the videos/displays?
t1_dure2kb	1	*	well, the fact that they didn't surrender after one means that there may be a need for a second...
t1_durar8a	1	*	Could read a little but Americans dont like that.   Edit: I expect downvotes please confirm your stupidity. 
t1_durczhd	1	*	well what government paid for the information for the results of said unit in exchange for secrecy/asylum?  haha
t1_duri0bv	1	*	It does when all anyone cares about is omgradiation and acting like the people there were the only ones who suffered during the war.
t1_durdkn8	1	*	I guess i care as much as you do.
t1_durplvg	1	*	From a glass half full perspective, the righteous don't live to see the horrors that follow.
t1_dur9xn4	0	*	global communist revolution :)
t1_durckz7	0	*	I hope you're not trying to equate Pearl Harbour with Nanjing...
t1_dur9nro	1	*	You do it by sending a threatening letter written in crayons... *or else*.
t1_duriwtw	0	*	The Japanese civilians did that?  The U.S. decided not to bomb a military base, they wanted to see what a nuke would do to a city full of innocent people.
t1_durso1q	1	*	..you get no candy.
t1_durcq20	1	*	What are you talking about? He was in a BBC documentary about Auschwitz, that's the opposite of hiding. 
t1_durcqss	1	*	I'm sure if you lived through the rise of the Nazis you would rebel and face certain death in a heartbeat /s
t1_duralf7	1	*	Because he made it up
t1_dusb7ro	1	*	Your so right why dont they post those pictures at the memorials how can you be so evil to kill babies.
t1_durp1l1	0	*	Both were horrendous. Both stories should never be forgotten. 
t1_durg6g4	1	*	Then it's like it never happened?
t1_durcpbt	1	*	No, them starting a war and killing millions made it ok. 
t1_durk79p	1	*	But their history books tend to have few pages on the 20th century at all. Museums don't matter if the youth aren't taught.
t1_dus9jl9	0	*	Yes I just learnt about those, wow I thought we were going to hell for the nukes, this is so fucked up :( 
t1_durb0p7	1	*	People claim the holocaust never even happened. 
t1_durc5y1	0	*	This response is very interesting. Would you consider yourself intelligent?
t1_dus9ih2	1	*	Omg this sound fucking awful it literally make me nauseous. You were right, I did not know this. Why don't they tell this in history class, and with guilt and shame?
t1_durxjv6	1	*	I'd like to see they have exhibition on unit 731 and SE Asia forced labor
t1_durd83o	1	*	Probably mentioned it since Japan tends to call out slander when memorials for victims under Japan in ww2 are held. Then it becomes the war of whataboutism 
t1_durbq9b	1	*	Read *Barefoot Gen*. It's a survivor's account of the atomic bombings in Japan in manga form.
t1_dv9wvt4	1	*	It is a war crime to use flamethrowers on civilians
t1_durao64	0	*	Iirc we are still using the purple hearts minted during ww2 in preparation of a mainland Japan invasion.
t1_durey82	1	*	Wrong
t1_durd6wk	1	*	Except for the fact that the atrocity of the nuclear attacks were caused by Japan's war atrocities
t1_durib89	1	*	Imagine sending them to Japanese schools 
t1_durxp69	1	*	> Ctrl + F > not even one apology to their monstrosity in south east asia  lol, nice PR
t1_durep47	0	*	I would say that people need reminders because they sure do like to forget things and create their own revisionist history. 
t1_durgygp	0	*	Maybe Germany should start sending around storytellers for the Allies and Soviet invasion of their country at the end of WWII.
t1_dusqy8b	1	*	I guess every single terroristic attack done by a Muslim whose country got invaded by you is justified. Get over 9/11 and every other single thing that happened to your country. You deserved it   /s
t1_durdniw	1	*	We acknowledge that fuck up.  As well as slavery, Indian eradication, etc.  Japan denies any of their atrocities happened.
t1_durbdbo	1	*	It isn't absolving them, it is saying when people have a *belief* , whether it be in an emperor, a god, or religion, it will cause people to do evil things 
t1_du3db3z	1	*	What are you TALKING ABOUT?  They were MOCKING that mindset.
t1_dsjynu7	1	*	He can also prioritize, no?
t1_dudgq49	1	*	Here is a list   https://crooked.com/take-action/
t1_dudi7x6	1	*	It is Saturday afternoon in NZ its hot and 95% humidity he should be at the beach. 
t1_du75j9g	0	*	yes, this is the way things are done! clap clap you go girl 
t1_du745sl	0	*	Uhh, no.
t1_du7cqwq	1	*	Full Clear.  Nothing could shake 14 year old me from giving up when I'm already $2.50 in the hole.
t1_du73xu5	1	*	Shut up! He's trying to make a point without backing it up and you're ruining it with facts!
t1_du764wy	1	*	Its not getting blasted on the headlines on news sites. Also I doubt anyone will even talk about this.
t1_du76lvu	1	*	Thanks bro /s
t1_dv35i5z	0	*	Lucky for all of us, the terrorists are idiots by definition.
t1_dv34n37	1	*	Points for creating a story. Seems a bit of a stretch though.
t1_dtxhtio	1	*	Hahaha right!! Amazing. I heard the Russians are shipping heroin into the cities. To hook the democrat voters and give the republicans the edge. 
t1_dseun4i	1	*	No, French laws apply to more than French citizens. Color me surprise.  
t1_dsf6l9f	0	*	Though nothing would stop them from adopting that law if they chose to.
t1_dsev2qs	1	*	Im sure its in the disclaimer and terms and conditions.  Apple has the right to do whatever it wants to their phones. If you dont like it then dont buy apple. Vote with your money. 
t1_dsgribh	1	*	No it'll be new feature of IPhone 11; along with a slightly better camera and a slightly more curved chassis to justify dropping another 1.5k on a phone 
t1_dsf7yfo	1	*	Nice, i'll trade that ribbon in for a new battery.
t1_dsfoyni	1	*	Ironic that the decision allowed the phones to be used for longer. 
t1_dsgdmla	1	*	Thanks dude
t1_dsf0z6n	1	*	ah yes; I forgot! VIVE LA FRANCE!!!!
t1_dsf156g	0	*	This isn't a lawsuit, it's a criminal prosecution because Apple's behaviour is against French law.  Were there too many big words in the article or something? 
t1_dses0a8	1	*	You know engineers have to design with constraints so nothing can be made to last indefinitely.  Your example is more like saying a Nokia 3310 would still work today. 
t1_dseprgy	0	*	The LEDs last long, but their little circuit boards don't.
t1_dsf25qr	1	*	Or just buy it so that nobody else can use it. 
t1_dsfezdk	1	*	Watch the price of an iPhone double.
t1_dsf2iqc	0	*	Have you ever heard of the centennial light bulb? How is that thing still going?
t1_dseso0d	1	*	If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live
t1_dsest73	1	*	Yeah, the goal of manufacturers is probably much closer to make something as cheap as possible that works for one year than make something that breaks after one year.

t1_dtbe6y4	1	*	The price drops dramatically when it gets legal, just like in the states, you can't build a syndicate on cheap products
t1_dtbf3wi	0	*	Harm reduction secondary to legalization of drugs is evidence-based. The quality of ganja in Playa will likely not improve, however. And that's the real tragedy here.

t1_du92fym	1	*	English is my first language and I'm not sure what they're saying.    I would guess it to mean Spain has the highest rate of organ donations from its citizens who have passed away.
t1_du8fry2	1	*	You sound american. Or what other country has doctors like that? Seriously, if you're that paranoid, get help or move to a country which isn't retarded.

t1_du8kxx1	1	*	> And no, its not because people are lazy.  Yeah, he phrased that in a real asshole way. The reason people don't opt-in is because they forget. These two things are not the same.
t1_du9xt78	1	*	Still a myth.
t1_du93xxx	0	*	So anyone can just dissect and humiliate my dead body because I don't own it? That's a flawed logic :/

t1_du8vkvt	1	*	Oh for sure! Some people just love a good conspiracy. 
t1_du8nj54	0	*	Yes, its being donated. What Im saying is its a little presumptuous of the Danish government to just help themselves to said liver.

t1_du8jv6s	1	*	I'm getting downvoted but I thought I would keep it up so people could have a good laugh :( 
t1_du8gkr1	0	*	No. Its in their best interest to keep the body alive, not you.

t1_du8jdcj	1	*	And get absolute shit ratings for their unit/hospital? When the alternative is saved most lives through organ transplantation award?
t1_du97fsq	1	*	If you're dead you can no longer own anything. 
t1_du8u6ef	1	*	That's going to happen if you opt-in in an opt out scenario anyway. I'd argue that there is less chance of doctors being desperate to gut you if there is a plentiful supply of organs anyway.
t1_du8cv18	0	*	I think you know very little about the country if you think that's gonna happen.
t1_du9182r	0	*	Yet you automatically put into the program. Lack of opposition does not equal consent. Could've sworn we already knew that. 
t1_du8e4gy	1	*	Fortunately, that seems to be the situation now.
t1_du8svrr	1	*	My point here is reply the comments like why everyone dont do this?. Because in some countries is not only a religious question.   We have dozens of  death angels stories here.
t1_du9bqyd	0	*	Very funny.
t1_du8ljqg	1	*	Well obviously if you aren't even eligible that wouldn't penalize you
t1_du8h3y4	0	*	Luckily you can opt out and not help others live a life worth living.    And that's okay, because default opt out preserves your rights.

t1_du91lyc	0	*	Ah. Can we apply this to voter ID in America? Its a choice to get voter a through a conscious effort to vote. Society doesnt owe anyone an easy path. 
t1_du8v8bf	1	*	Your family has the final say about donating organs, if you are in a vegetive state your family will decide what happens to you. 
t1_du8g10j	0	*	That doesn't do anything for people who don't have family, which, unfortunately, is a decent portion of those who would be unable to consent on their own.
t1_du91ki9	1	*	Schizophrenia is not multiple personality disorder
t1_du9f737	1	*	Yeah their argument makes no sense...more legally available organs would greatly reduce the number of the organs on the black market b/c the demand for them wouldn't be there. 
t1_du95cbq	0	*	Really?!    I never thought of that angle.  Do you have any more info on this that I could read up on?  This is why we can't have nice things, apparently.  
t1_du8wr9m	0	*	You can choose what to donate and what not, just keep the dick man.
t1_du9awiy	0	*	This seems like a ridiculous concern to have. Has this ever happened before?
t1_du8l6py	1	*	Well that's obviously different.
t1_du94iur	1	*	It can also be eliminated by realizing this is a ridiculous fear
t1_du8ly3f	1	*	Nurse here. I literally have no idea if 95% of my patients are organ donors. And even when we do it would never affect your care. It's a fucking paranoid point of view 
t1_du94321	1	*	Thats pretty jewy
t1_du8jl8p	1	*	You would be exempt from that policy. It's how it works in Singapore. 
t1_du8wptc	1	*	lol
t1_du9xpc9	1	*	That's not really what I meant by 'opt out' that's more 'they just can't use your organs, unfortunately.' Fair point though.
t1_du8jjfb	1	*	Both my parents are practicing physicians and they believe that practice occurs. Take that how you will.
t1_du92kkg	1	*	Because it's the **GUBERMENT!!**
t1_du8bvcc	1	*	Those are both kinda bogus reasons.   You'd be dead, why would you care?
t1_du984vw	1	*	You do realise that when you opt out just out of protest, you will only fuck over the people who desperately need the organs.
t1_du8hvnj	0	*	Why should religion matter?  
t1_du8lz3z	1	*	So? It's not up to the state to decide what to do with MY body. It's the same reason why the state should not be in the business of restricting abortions.
t1_du8h51f	0	*	Right, but what is it, one donor can save 8 lives? Pretty good math from where I'm sitting. 
t1_du9y06d	0	*	What would you suggest, as a first step towards a culture in which the default assumption is that everyone should be a donor? This seems like a logical one.
t1_du8jg5d	0	*	If you have no next of kin, the government owns your shit. Sorry to break it to you. 
t1_du87c83	0	*	Maybe a decision should be made mandatory - with the three options you mentioned and the possibility to change it whenever you like.
t1_du8qv5p	1	*	People don't get organs if they can't show their responsibility for them. Alcoholics don't just get livers, smokers don't just get lungs.
t1_du8o555	0	*	And they won't be banned from getting one when they need it, just that people who actually took the time out to fill out their card will get it first.
t1_du8purr	1	*	strawman@clearlynotwhatIwasreferringto.com
t1_du8hb3g	0	*	Not a chance. An opt out policy gives you the power over your body.
t1_du8kezx	1	*	Man, that is a sad cynical view of the world.
t1_du8rvo1	1	*	Yeah, that's what it really is, but don't give, don't get is just a catchier name I guess...
t1_du96zoq	1	*	Theres a certain dignity in being asked for your organs instead of just assuming that they can harvest you.
t1_du8gg6i	0	*	People are generally shitty, i don't see why i should try to avoid it?
t1_du8qhrt	0	*	No, but if you could opt out of being a complete weapon that would be great, kthxb

t1_dtvtq24	1	*	That probably gives him a sense of pride and accomplishment
t1_dtvh22m	0	*	Thats a new fact in the bunch for me, any sources on that?
t1_dtvo666	1	*	no. Fuck hunters. I'm glad he's dead.
t1_dtvlcib	1	*	> Like it or not, this is a method of conservation.   I *can* be, but illegal poaching and hunting is a **huge** issue. The glorification of the 'sport' is a problem to begin with. 
t1_dtvmr02	1	*	It's amazing how lions survived for hundreds of thousands of years before guns were invented. Now that guns are used to help lions, they're thriving where they once were scarce. 
t1_dtvg7k9	1	*	Finding it really hard to feel any sympathy.
t1_dtvpvb4	1	*	*Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else thereafter.*  Au contraire...
t1_dtvpspf	1	*	http://www.ecolarge.com/work/the-200-million-question-how-much-does-trophy-hunting-really-contribute-to-african-communities/
t1_dtvghe5	0	*	That arguments usually not touted by reputable conservationist organizations.  It's been pretty well debunked.   https://www.thedodo.com/does-hunting-help-conservation-1389284014.html 
t1_dtvf1ix	1	*	Also, preparing his shot? Perhaps using weapons from the 1800s to make it great sport?
t1_dtvudca	0	*	Eating cows from farms is also taking away from nature, so any meat eaters that die or being killed is oky...
t1_dtvmcat	0	*	That's irrelevant. If lion was tasty would it be ok? 
t1_dtvshyj	1	*	What gets me is someone else designed and built that rifle, and someone else lured the lion into position. I have no idea how he has any feeling of pride and accomplishment
t1_dtvgs2q	1	*	Because the hunters aren't paying to conserve the species they are paying to hunt?   
t1_dtwq0gz	0	*	It's like pretend hunting.  The danger is apparently real, but not the skill.  Like a VR life simulator with the dangers toggled on.
t1_dtvhtz8	1	*	Yeah some countries also have issues with fake orphanages set up to take tourist money. Wouldn't be surprised if some of the hunting places for conservation are still as risky for corruption 
t1_dtvdytz	1	*	Apologies for the wording - I was only pertaining to the man's death.

t1_dtw7aue	0	*	Youre cool with this guy killing animals and acting like tough shit bc he trapped a lion near a fence and shot the thing?!?!?
t1_dtviavm	1	*	It's been shown that the money doesn't help the animals in any significant way and most of it ends up in corrupt hands
t1_dtvzomo	1	*	My sentiment exactly. 
t1_dtvj8bn	1	*	Some humans are worth less than animals.
t1_dtvh9bg	1	*	Hey! Dont knock it till you try it.
t1_dtvlrw0	0	*	You missed my point, idiot 
t1_dtve4j5	1	*	it's called 'embalming', done at funeral homes
t1_dtvj3dx	0	*	Right? Lol
t1_dtvk0h1	1	*	Leave the hunting of hunters to me.
t1_dtxgycg	1	*	You don't need to eat animals. It's just as optional as killing for sport is. Both are forms of unnecessary killing.  
t1_dtvdfzf	1	*	How do you know he wasnt killing it for food? If he survived and said that he was going to eat it would that suddenly be alright? 
t1_dtvpkb4	0	*	Whats barbaric is people celebrating a mans death.
t1_dtvlz88	1	*	Agreed. Genocidal hatred of humans appears to motivate these people, moreso than love of life. 
t1_dtviqcm	1	*	When your penis is tiny, you have to overcompensate somehow. Some people foolishly take pills or get surgery, others fly to distant lands and shoot animals in a closure. 
t1_dtve7sq	1	*	I never said it was either
t1_dtv7s1o	1	*	It really is infuriating.
t1_dtvf9wq	1	*	>while having donated nothing to conservation efforts themselves  I'm assuming, then, that you've donated millions of your income for the right and privilege to having an opinion?
t1_dtvrfcn	0	*	Hmmm next thing you'll be telling me is they've taken the lion mod out too.
t1_dtvlxyj	0	*	Regardless of his motives, he did an awful lot more to contribute to conversation than we did.
t1_dtvqpcs	1	*	Without random people throwing money up to do this there wouldn't be enough money going around to pay conservationists to stop the locals from poaching the animals for their hides, ivory, etc.
t1_dtvnzzk	0	*	By all means, then. That clearly makes it ok to celebrate someone's death. I'll be sure to buy streamers to toss around the next time a worker dies in the factory farming industry.
t1_dtw5co7	0	*	Gun nut idiocy. 
t1_dtvqiee	1	*	I am confident that the ecosystems would have no problem handling these hypothetical situations in exactly the same way it successfully did so for millions of years before we were us.
t1_dtwo3xy	0	*	> insulting both the animals and our heritage.  Why does this apply to canned hunting but not regular hunting?
t1_dtvg4qa	1	*	At best one could convince me that the practice is a necessary evil.  There's no doubt though that these hunters are raging assholes if not actual psychopaths.
t1_dtxfxm0	1	*	Yes. 
t1_dtvjl5r	0	*	And that's what someone did... With a stray bullet. 
t1_dtvf9dx	1	*	The same reason non-hunters dont donate.    How much have you donated to conserve lions? 
t1_dtvdu28	1	*	It's possible, but it looks awful. Taxidermied animals only look so good because they have fur, feathers etc. to hide the stitches.
t1_dtw6peg	1	*	I stand by my statement.
t1_dtva0ti	0	*	Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6S5amkCoyc) from vsauce about that topic =)
t1_dtvwdv0	1	*	It costs an insane amount of money to get wild game through customs. These outfitters donate the meat if the hunters don't want to pay for that. The meat isn't wasted, we do that at restaurants
t1_dtvgoq0	1	*	I know I shouldn't, but I am glad he is dead. One less idiot wasting oxygen.
t1_dtvsco1	0	*	So you stop at Lion or do you also value the life of an Ant on the same level?

t1_dtw5jnz	1	*	Don't get me wrong, I think trophy hunters are douchebags, but they are not the real problem, and as it turns out actually are helping some. 
t1_dtve6wk	1	*	If dog shelters found out that puppy torture chambers were the best way to raise funds to help stray dogs, it would still be super fucked up. It could be helping more dogs in total but wtf.
t1_dtvobs0	0	*	Carefully.  Oh, so carefully.
t1_dtvf4h3	0	*	So your saying check yourself before you wreck yourself? 
t1_dtvv2go	1	*	Not true, you can complain about certain species being hunting because they are at risk. Why do you think it's so expensive to hunt a lion? Because there's not an awful lot of them left. 
t1_dtvhi3y	1	*	Most hunters do not hunt endangered animals for sport.
t1_dtvrly6	1	*	Us poor people don't get a say?  It's bullshit.  You should have been swamped in downvotes.  What if I donated millions to the local animal shelter, can I kill your dog?
t1_dtvk148	0	*	That's nature.  I'm all for trophy hunters trying to take down a lion without a gun.
t1_dtwak2e	0	*	I like how you had to put strong men in quotes because the entire idea of being a strong man seems made up to you

t1_dtlz9m6	1	*	And solar is already cheaper than coal from a plant for most countries.

t1_dutvud5	0	*	No, thats right of conquest, and the Arabs tried that when they built illegal settlements in the West Bank.   Its no longer the norm in law.
t1_duu7d8t	1	*	Frightened isn't really the correct word
t1_dsfq21d	1	*	It most likely used to be something like four times the safe limit (that's my guess). Even though the goal hasn't been achieved, progress has been made.
t1_dsg8sy3	0	*	As an American citizen living in China I doubt you know what you are talking about. 
t1_dsfw6gl	1	*	If you took time to think your comment through, you'd see the very obvious answer for yourself.  Nah, better to make a knee jerk comment that shits on good stuff that China is doing.
t1_dtvh604	1	*	According to the FISA warrants, no they weren't. They relied on a yahoo article to verify.

t1_duecpp4	1	*	No, they're telling Jews that their freedom of religion doesn't give them the right to cut off part of a baby. If that's a deal breaker for them living in Iceland, then oh well. 
t1_dtygry5	1	*	I'm not sure what an acceptable level of randomly exploding would be.  That still seems like a lot.
t1_dtyc1ii	0	*	Seriously, it's no wonder terrorist recruiting is going up and is specifically targeting the west.

t1_dv4jw4y	1	*	Yeah this is the real issue. Morons don't understand if they stop getting Starbucks they'll cut their sugar in half, assuming they don't drink soda too. 
t1_dusqt1t	0	*	When you say US government do you mean Chimp in charge?

t1_dutbphd	1	*	The only one that cheated in that election was Hillary.
t1_du3n9pg	1	*	Yes, the Jews want just one tiny country, the Arabs got the whole of the middle east and north Africa divided to many different countries, many of them artificial.
t1_du2v43q	1	*	That's what Hitler also wanted and worked for. Are you ignoring the fact that the Baath is a National Socialist party?
t1_dui2a3n	1	*	The Turkish army is cooperating with the FSA, those guys are for sure motivated as the stakes are high for them.

t1_dt2gcsm	1	*	Number of counties who's opinion of the matter makes any difference: 1.  Only Israel gets to decide where its capitol is.
t1_dt2bmhj	0	*	That's the location of the embassy, israel can call whatever city they want their capital.    That's like the UN being able to decree that Manchester is the capital of england now instead of london.
t1_dt2utbu	1	*	No, it would probably have been some kind of international city.

t1_dttghio	0	*	People are uneducated idiots. I swear. 
t1_dtti03x	1	*	The main problem is that insurance companies want discounts, so prices have to get jacked up in order to provide discounts.   Adam ruins everything has a great video on this.
t1_dttjhyg	1	*	You in the UK ? 
t1_dtu2goa	1	*	Yeah, I was just curious. I was told that, not me making it up. Now Im being downvoted for wanting to know if its true. Thanks, Reddit. 
t1_dttrhiu	0	*	In this case, sure you can.  Small government where it makes sense, big government where that makes sense.
t1_dttcfxv	1	*	And how much is your deductible mate.

t1_dttc6qg	0	*	Sounds nice.
t1_dttfjc9	1	*	It's because this person was irresponsible and didn't have health insurance. Everyone else is doing just fine.
t1_dttc60v	1	*	That is the lucky wage that gets no more help from the government but you still are not paid enough to really deal with problems.  Also our min wage is 7.25 so let that sink in too lol

t1_dtu34a2	0	*	I said I'd pay xa31000 to the NHS. Not to a private company. There's a subtle but important difference.  I also said IF they were under threat.  You're being a little dramatic here.

t1_dttaah9	1	*	I can get seen next day or within a few days here in the UK. Cos of my disabilities I'd be dead or homeless without the NHS.
t1_dtu2e9b	1	*	I think this is the nicest reddit comment I've ever received. Thank you!   Also have an upvote back.
t1_dttpz8a	1	*	Cancer treatment is though. Even if he'd been diagnosed he wouldn't have been able to afford treatment.
t1_dttilrr	0	*	How on earth is complaining about your country's Heath care system, while also knowing it's better than America's POS system, mutually exclusive? 
t1_dtv5ab3	1	*	Yeah..... Nope.   A  M E R I C A   S O  B  I G  is not a good argument

t1_dtuf3zt	0	*	Well gosh, that depends on the context now doesn't it? Can the average person afford the cost of a quadruple amputation and iron lung? How extreme are we getting? Are we going full Vader?
t1_dttllx9	1	*	TBF the Hulkster is the REAL American and spent his early career opposing the Russians. 
t1_dttg2gu	0	*	Yay! Neoliberalism!
t1_dttcyp7	0	*	Are your doctors ready to kiss $250k entry-level salaries goodbye?
t1_dttf2ck	1	*	They're also free while you're pregnant and for a year after giving birth (in England) as is dental treatment.
t1_dttd8x6	0	*	$100?  what was that for?
t1_dtuelvg	1	*	But you trust multi billion dollar profit driven companies to ensure you get a fair go... yeah that makes a heap of sense 
t1_dttc0jb	1	*	You can very easily buy it in a store. Chances are if you go in and they give you ibuprofen, you've gone in with a non-issue.
t1_dttc695	0	*	The fact that if you do a bad job, people will go somewhere else. With the NHS you really cant if you are poor.
t1_dttefh4	0	*	Well ok then. It's free at the point of use. Is that clear enough for you pedant?  And in the context of the alternative (ie. US system) it's damn near free.
t1_dttcqi6	0	*	Interesting confounder here though... what if poor health is associated with poor driving or more suicidal?
t1_dttwmxo	0	*	They are higher in the UK than the US? I dont know, Im asking. But id much rather pay more in tax and get free healthcare than pay less in tax and be fucked when I go to the hospital.
t1_dttdse4	1	*	Your TLDR sums it up perfectly. That story was a terrifying display how a lack of freedom in choice will ruin your health.
t1_dtt9m94	0	*	Obama care wasn't supposed to be good. It was supposed to be anythinh they could get through to expand coverage.
t1_dttb1a8	0	*	I would suspect not true at all. Where is your maths? That would be over 10% of an average wage. (working on a simple $2=xa31) which isn't the case
t1_dttdqgg	1	*	You pay a hell of a [lot more](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/%7E/media/images/publications/fund-report/2014/june/davis_mirror_2014_es1_for_web.jpg) in the US.
t1_dttg6xt	1	*	Dude. That sums it up perfectly. 
t1_dttdiv4	1	*	The USA doesn't make decisions based off common sense and practicality. It makes decisions based off a popularity contest 
t1_dtteivj	0	*	They made you pay for parking? Was this London or another city centre because that really is a bit absurd. 
t1_dttbwwr	0	*	Haha yeah, Europe has never developed any medicine ever. There are nine countries with more Nobel prizes per capita in sciences then U.S. has in Europe, by the way. Jesus, are you stupid. 
t1_dttvpv5	1	*	Who said anything about spending more?
t1_dttiiyv	1	*	Exactly. Just like their prison system. Totally fucked up.

t1_dttd5qk	1	*	Cost me about 100 bucks for a c-section and 4 nights in a private room in the UAE.  Didn't even have to pay for parking!
t1_dtta3rl	1	*	Its abhorrent that that deal is forgotten, especially post-brexit bus, whenever NHS cuts are mentioned.
t1_dtu0qb5	0	*	I'll disagree with one part. The doctors and nurses absolutely care about your health. Many are wonderful people who have saved lives.
t1_dttaye6	1	*	They would rather start an uprising against the universal healthcare.
t1_dttjtib	1	*	Another American here. It's true. I feel like I am made of glass here. I can't afford a large medical bill so if anything happens I'm screwed financially. 
t1_dtv530i	1	*	Not really cherrypicking when that shit happens regularly
t1_dttg48h	1	*	those of us that vote for decent candidates are a huge minority.   Too many people are still stuck on Republican vs Democrat.   To most people, any other options don't count.   I agree, we're insane.
t1_dtthwwq	1	*	It's a shame what you can sue for and win in America. 
t1_dttbfgb	0	*	Conservative Party (Headed up by the Prime Minister Theresa May) is right wing. While the Labour Party (Headed up by Jeremy Corbyn) is left wing.
t1_dttji2r	1	*	That's horrible... I'm sorry to hear you and your family had to go through that.
t1_dtthzt5	0	*	I love how rich Britains have a health insurance policy because the government system is so shitty.
t1_dttetcf	1	*	But but the free market will make everything good for everyone...!
t1_dttocep	0	*	Yes it is. Overpriced just for coverage, and copays are unaffordable beyond that. I really hope youre trolling.
t1_dtt4ugm	1	*	But of course! 'Tis the internets m'boy!
t1_dtthhuq	1	*	I waited three months for a mammogram with excellent insurance. You're gonna wait no matter where you are unless you're extremely wealthy.
t1_dttl95a	0	*	Not anymore...GEOTUS fired the ones causing the stove pipes
t1_dttfpl7	1	*	Lmao.
t1_dttg1ou	1	*	The US is tied with every other country when all causes of death are not counted. Turns out, we're all immortal!
t1_dttcwmy	1	*	Pretty much    The US is huge on research, and it you can afford it then it has the best to offer in the world, but fucking nobody can afford it.
t1_dtte5kq	0	*	OMG PEWDIEPIE SAID THAT!?! It must be true!!!

t1_dttv0vs	1	*	And an interstate freeway fell down and killed about 15 people ;   we are truely in 'Atlas Shrugged' times .
t1_dttcl9a	0	*	I believe I read that the costs of healthcare have risen with the number of positions in administration and their salaries.   Unfortunately I don't have a source for that right now.
t1_dtti71x	1	*	You think they gave him the real ones?
t1_dttcq9g	0	*	Also If you want American style healthcare, pay for private insurance. Hospitals like Princess Grace is London (US based for-profit hospital) is run exactly like in the US.

t1_dttlgbx	0	*	What's crazy is the amount of Patriots who think this song is about how amazing America is. 
t1_dttfc2b	1	*	It's not a cock-up. It is deliberate. The money lenders make fortunes from lending us our own resources. The pernicious compound interest trick has us all by the balls.
t1_dttc3f7	1	*	Wasn't it only a privatised system for processing paperwork or something? I don't think they were going full US but the attack campaigns made it seem that way
t1_dttckxq	1	*	I'd suggest 2 paracetamol and a lie down.
t1_dtte3av	1	*	I find it amusing, Wales, Scotland and NI don't pay for prescriptions, pay no Uni costs and have a lot less taxes to pay.
t1_dttdr5h	1	*	Seems strange to pay for ambulances. We get that included. Do you know why you have to pay for them? 
t1_dttawk3	1	*	No party/person is perfect.  You have to look at multiple issues and attempt to vote for who agrees with you most.
t1_dttgto9	1	*	Well there you have it. Fuck the poor!
t1_dtu672c	1	*	If you think that's bad, my mother was once denied food stamps when I was a kid because my state said she made too much money at $8/hour.
t1_dtt94yx	1	*	Here in Australia I can see my doctor the same day most times. We also have doctors that make house calls.

t1_dttd7dp	1	*	I have to say that based on her comment shes probably not a great GP. People who are poor and have no health insurance still make bad lifestyle decisions. It just the way people are.

t1_dttf5a3	1	*	Oh I blame them 100%

t1_dtthnhs	0	*	What cost $100? Isnt it free in Sweden?
t1_dttc14o	0	*	Why do you think Trump got elected? We're still wasting time blaming scapegoats, but the anger is very much there.
t1_dttao05	0	*	Well I pay privately for my insurance.  I could get a cheap plan, but then it doesn't cover shit.
t1_dtws2ln	1	*	What does freedom have to do with universal health care? 
t1_dtv52hy	1	*	No, you really wouldn't
t1_dttduz4	1	*	And I was outraged by the parking fees.
t1_dtte49j	1	*	It bamboozles me. My guess is that they cant tell the difference between socialism and communism... They think socialist healthcare will lead to a hammer and sickle on their flag.   
t1_dttk3hf	1	*	Running out of money? At least then you can hunt human for meat (and there are a lot of them). I've always wondered why more people didn't go full psycho when they have nothing left to lose.
t1_dtu0o8c	0	*	Sorry, I should have clarified you have to have an adult job. 
t1_dttiy5d	1	*	Of course they care. Gotta keep you alive so you can keep paying that debt. 
t1_dtti07f	1	*	My point is - it is available here too, and much cheaper than the US. If people hated the nhs and wanted the US system, they can do it here already.
t1_dttcyzn	0	*	Absolutely, but the NHS and the current American system aren't the only options
t1_dtuacer	1	*	Didn't even have a smartphone at the time. I was fuckin broke and already living paycheck to paycheck. 
t1_dttlziq	1	*	Who is advocating spending more?
t1_dtthlbc	1	*	minimum wage here is still like $7.50 I believe.   When I was 16, I was making $6.75 at my first job.
t1_dtthay1	1	*	> it's the middle-class professionals and intellectuals who have a slightly socialistic bend  Nobody with ANY knowledge of economics supports socialism...
t1_dtty775	0	*	I'm glad that you're glad. I'm afraid that I'm not so glad. But I don't have a choice either way. Looks like I'll have to continue to subsidise other people's bad life decisions.
t1_dtuaty5	1	*	American ignorance at work boys and girls.
t1_dttkm2n	1	*	yep that's exactly what we did.   Iven after bankrupcy, I still have my student loans which I'm paying on, so I have a good jump on building good credit.
t1_dttkrm5	1	*	He chose to scam the system and not pay insurance when he was healthy to save money. He made his choice and now has to fac the consequences.
t1_dttxe0t	1	*	Yeah, I guess given those numbers it really isnt comparable. 
t1_dttbl30	0	*	Well you have to pay a surcharge on medication unless you are exempt, its a flat rate though which means it's either increadibly cheap or increadibly expensive (like for generics) 
t1_dttbavc	1	*	Can't we just pay for it?  
t1_dttgt2a	1	*	Ye, cool, they stitched my finger when I got glass through it, but when it came for cancer screening I was going to be waiting for months for a check.   Private was a few hundred quid and no fuss.
t1_dttnp4g	1	*	In Canada you also need Health Insurance to get perscription or one time meds/antibiotics. In Ontario (idk about other provinces) it is now free for anyone under 25, which is good. 
t1_dttlr07	1	*	I have an interview with the NHS, gonna save this and talk about the finance parts. thanks!!

t1_dtu43kv	1	*	I'd love to see lobbying banned. There's no other way to describe it than bribes.  And I mean that for all parties.
t1_dtth0ug	0	*	My country has same issues: people go with non emergencies to the ER. Government is at fault, finally they have being teaching people to do it the correct way.
t1_dtth8rn	1	*	The public that defends them is deluded. The government knows very well that public healthcare is better in every aspect, but public healthcare doesn't make them as much money. 
t1_dttbijf	1	*	thoughts and prayers brought to you by the GOP.  also another dead democrat is a GOP success story... 
t1_dttde9k	1	*	It is undeniably in trouble, though, and Trump's statement was perfectly accurate. That's my point
t1_dttftpa	1	*	Our whole fucked up country revolves around money. Ridiculous. Its really sad. America had potential to be great but now its so corrupt 
t1_dttftpe	1	*	It's awful. We have legal bribery here. 
t1_dttk5c5	1	*	No money yet unfortunately. I gotta have something to start with lol
t1_dttj8eu	1	*	To be fair that wasn't even an attack. The LNP outright used the US system as what they viewed to be an 'improvement.' Tories just want to kill the poor, but won't ever admit it. 
t1_dttcs4x	1	*	That's not at all true and the page you link to clearly shows this. Most of South America and Southern Africa is far more unequal, while also being democratic.
t1_dttd0n0	0	*	Clicking the link made me think Newsweek was a satirical site
t1_dtte39p	1	*	And yet there's Corey Booker voting against cheap medicine from Canada because we don't know if it's safe. He obviously doesn't know people use medicine meant for farm animals as substitutes
t1_dttb9lg	1	*	Exactly the same in the UK. US style healthcare is considered the ultimate negative example.
t1_dtt9gvm	0	*	money has value  definitely a fact, policy-related, and I'm pretty sure he realizes that one (although even that could be a tall order with the alzheimers)
t1_dttbvnt	1	*	man.. i'd take appendicitis 1000 times before testicular torsion.   That shit has terrified me ever since I learned it existed.
t1_dtthgck	0	*	You clearly didnt read where I said you dont abandon your mom when she gets sick, I feel like it should be the same for your country.
t1_dttbk0d	0	*	Greater that 45,000 is 40% after a quick google search.    Something that is not worth it to me. 
t1_dttc1i1	1	*	And the people, in every poll, would be more than happy to fund it better via increased taxes. It's all the current government's fault for the state it's in.
t1_dttkt26	1	*	It would be an absolute godsend of all the Americans complaining here justness left went to Europe. Dear fucking Lord the thought makes me want to cry tears of joy 
t1_dtu21qv	1	*	@@P April r yqlq 
t1_dttjj2d	1	*	That seems to be the thing in here, a lot of people in here I'd guess aren't insured or have shitty insurance. 
t1_dttdybd	0	*	It's the kind of suggestion year 7-8 English students make at school. Lack of understanding economics leads to people, especially those less informed, to start movements for dumb ideas. 
t1_dttfauw	1	*	So do you just comb every comment section for any instance of Obama so you can make your stupid quips or what? 
t1_dttjxpf	1	*	That is also true for our ERs in America.   Ours might be worse in wait time because they are the only healthcare that is forced to see uninsured people.
t1_dttj7tc	1	*	that's my dad basically. Come to think about it, write this, I think I'm the same in a way.
t1_dttfq9l	0	*	Yeah, but here in America we have the right to do such things.  Not so much in the UK. The Government decided for them.
t1_dttdyxz	1	*	EVERYTHING is more expensive in Australia... except health care. I am so not whinging about house or fuel prices again after reading about their health care.

t1_dttn0jo	1	*	American logic is I aint paying for your cancer 
t1_dttawgo	1	*	Middle class here. I vote down any tax increase as I see no benefit to it.  Entire system needs a reboot. Increasing my income tax to >35% wont fix anything, just keeps me stuck.
t1_dttbroh	0	*	there may be people who can't afford to pay for that consultation 
t1_dttdigz	1	*	 The one thing Queenslanders are winning at (outside of Rugby League) is the fact we dont have to pay for Ambulances anywhere in this country. 
t1_dtth4lu	1	*	Literally this. The NHS properly run and properly funded works like a charm. The conservative want to carve it up but they know they would have a revolution on their hands if they privatised it.
t1_dtthtyc	1	*	Half the country didn't bother to vote. So you've got a quarter of dumb fucking yanks holding the place hostage in the name of racism and class warfare. 
t1_dttknn3	1	*	In the US, it costs (in my experience) about $200 just to see a general doctor for a visit if you don't have health insurance.   A specialist is more than double that. It's insane.

t1_dtvahqo	1	*	> The government isnt supposed to be a get out of jail free card for people who have done nothing to make themselves successful.  Healing the sick is not a get out of jail free card.
t1_dttcmal	0	*	If youtube has taught me anything, it's that Americans also find plenty of stupid ways to injure themselves despite having to pay for their care.
t1_dttci8j	1	*	Fucking love Hulk Hogan, he was a great figurehead in the downfall of Gawker.  Shitty tabloid blogs, take note, don't out a billionaire when he's in Saudi Arabia, he MIGHT hold a BIT of a grudge.

t1_dte3z29	1	*	Eh, it did put the one Spain related article in the list.
t1_dtehcp9	1	*	This pretty much. Saying Putin is an asshole will not get you in any trouble for the most part. Investigating actual specific corruption schemes will likely get you killed.

t1_dsnd0xx	1	*	Yeah, an island is about the worst possible place you can be in the event of a nuke boom
t1_dsncf4t	1	*	On this episode of TIFU
t1_dsndc78	1	*	You'll float too...
t1_dsn207q	0	*	Dude, Trump was golfing during all this. Nothing was putin motion, especially as this was from an isolated state run local event and not through any military channels
t1_dsnbvxy	1	*	USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
t1_dsnaim6	1	*	I wouldnt say there arent homes with basements in Hawaii, but Id say I havent seen any. 
t1_dsngutj	1	*	They don't have reentry vehicles yet, they cannot hit Hawaii.
t1_dsn54x3	1	*	Bug out bag and dig in to lava rock. Sweet solution. There are literally 0 basements here. Are you suggesting everyone should make a bomb shelter? Wish I could live in the Cold War era
t1_dsn7fkm	0	*	Yeah and I'm sure all of the countries will by fine with the us nuke if a country for the first time since WW2
t1_dsntl2p	1	*	Lol i meant more of a personal computer as opposed to a control panel with buttons sort of thing if you see what i mean.
t1_dsna3e3	1	*	The zone of certain death is only a few km wide even for quite powerful nukes. Most people in the suburbs of a big city would probably survive if a nuke hit the center.

t1_dsndwdb	1	*	Grey Sentra, actually. Saw those other two turning around just before the bridge, and I'd just made it past the stop light.
t1_dsni2u9	1	*	Speak or Die I guess 
t1_dsnne6a	1	*	ok then but what if it started a gender war?
t1_dsn7ij0	0	*	All good info but in a post apocalyptic scenario as Bill Burr would say, if you dont have a gun you are just collecting resources for the other guy 
t1_dsn6jo3	1	*	Damn this really sounds like the stuff I read about the cold war :(

t1_dsn5fcg	1	*	That's what scares me so much. And that's why I hope that his subordinates would refuse to follow his orders when it comes to launching nukes.
t1_dsn492f	0	*	For which I'm sure we're all thankful
t1_dsnmqcw	1	*	Your browser was not built by government employees.
t1_dsnjm9k	1	*	My plan is simple   Worry about asteroids and terrorists  well before nuclear attacks 
t1_dsnoe29	1	*	Makes sense, right?  But then again, it's just one theory.  I have others.
t1_dsnie1e	1	*	They used to call me a paranoid freak for shit like this. 
t1_dsnesmg	1	*	So the leaders of those countries would high five and congratulate them for eliminating a shithole?
t1_dsn73o0	0	*	Lets stop pretending NK will ever attack. It would be like hitting themselves with much more than they have, because of the response. Absolute nonsense.
t1_dsncaf2	1	*	Yes I am sure I want to send the test alarm, why are there so many confirmatio-oh shit.
t1_dsnc7q1	0	*	Are you suggesting that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was fear mongering?   The Japanese really did attack, you know. 
t1_dsmz8om	1	*	That's total bullshit. The vast majority of Hawaiians would be far far from the blast radius and would be affected at all. The blast isn't that large relative to how people are distributed. 
t1_dsn68hh	1	*	Bro have u never seen indiana jones? Youre supposed to get into a fridge
t1_dsmv6uf	1	*	More skull-duggery I see.

t1_dsn4yxa	0	*	Don't worry hun, dad fought them off. Slight bruises. Will be back tmr night. Love you.
t1_dsndzg2	1	*	If that happened I think wed alllll be fucked. 
t1_dsnpdh8	1	*	If you love her like a sister, you could be telling her that any old time though with no risk and only a lovefest right? So go ahead! 
t1_dsn6z85	1	*	This is as far as most people should go, have a disaster prep kit, some non perishable food, some water.   First sign danger fill the bath
t1_dsne6ha	1	*	I am also in Hawaii. There are no civilian fallout shelters (at least not on Oahu). 
t1_dsmthjs	0	*	Look up: SBIRS, DSP satellite, UEWR, PARCS, and PAVE PAWS. Systems the military use to detect incoming missiles. Quite fascinating really. 
t1_dsn9vlb	0	*	You know how hard it is to find good help out here? 
t1_dtkgjxf	1	*	I think you can safely say he has a lot of 1 st hand experience.
t1_dtk15vn	1	*	It's not his area academically, but the NHS certainly is extremely personal to him, given the extent to which he has relied upon it, and his health in general.
t1_duxla65	1	*	It could be both. Probably is some of each. 
t1_dsi212e	0	*	Nope, just a bunch of foreign jews immigrating with the intent of establishing a jewish state in a muslim majority area.  Sounds pretty simmilar to the settlements actually.
t1_dtcu44y	1	*	You are right, nobody cares except for Trump. He will throw a hissyfit on Twitter when he sees TV coverage of the wedding with Obama present.
t1_dtcu3qh	1	*	All of the commonwealth nations see it as an event. Especially enough so that South Park can make fun of it - even Americans know how important it is to Canadians, for instance. As is tradition.
t1_durxko8	1	*	Not skin color but these regions/areas have a historical tendency of being resistant to external influences for cultural and philosophical enlightenment, in my view.  
t1_duiq2uu	1	*	Did you mean to link a different article? That one talked about making pagan events kid-friendly by using things like bubble-wands in their rituals. 
t1_duhergn	1	*	Ok, downvoted you.
t1_duiug99	1	*	> this is when the Inquisition would step in and start burning the heretics responsible and rooting out the carried-over pagan beliefs that underpin it  Back when men were men.
t1_duiunls	1	*	There is still plenty of heresy to stamp out.
t1_duhcqhp	1	*	I'm sure that sounded educated and enlightened as you were writing it.
t1_duiu5xt	1	*	Both should be hunted down by the state.
t1_dui8p8p	0	*	That's pretty much what I'm thinking. What do you do when you have nothing to do?
t1_duhopxx	1	*	So we're just....more advanced, and they'll catch up is what you're saying?  Also that it's fine?
t1_dui85q0	1	*	Excuse me? They definitely don't need to abandon their beliefs. In their own countries. Where they have plenty of laws protecting their own brand of religions.
t1_dsy4z7u	1	*	As did the Canadians.
t1_dsx84k3	1	*	Thats what I thought as well. But you make a good point any advanced system will probably have Russian oversight. But this is state vs state rather than rebels so some real posturing going on here.
t1_dsx9mk9	1	*	inb4 someone accuse you of whataboutism
t1_dsx52y0	0	*	Or because Kurds love to launch terrorist attacks against Turkish civilians.

t1_dtr5ibw	1	*	Cool
t1_dtr3btw	1	*	If it's a warzone, it's indeed safer to not go outside unless you must. And male nowsaday indeed has bigger chance to get falsely accused of rape with no evidence needed
t1_dtptdpp	0	*	Last thing you will see in Western media, the fact that Putin is actually very popular within his own country, and that they are not blind, naive, or deluded by him. 
t1_dv0f3fh	1	*	I'm no strategist, but I find that highly unlikely. Submarines are sneaky sneaks.
t1_du90aa9	1	*	yep, those should be banned too

t1_dsl3wn4	0	*	What would be a normal Muslim country? Because I assume that you don't think that Iran or Saudi Arabia are normal.

t1_duxfld6	1	*	> LOL  Sarcasm is really hard to grasp sometimes, but this is more than obvious, buddy.
t1_dsid9dq	1	*	Most rabid trump supporters can barely tell you what day tomorrow is, you think they can see how f'ed they are gonna be in a few years?

t1_dthjgq5	0	*	The right isn't the expectation. It would be perfectly OK to try to discourage breeding. That isn't the same as selecting an elite who are permitted to breed.
t1_dtgykht	1	*	That's still a really low number - especially if paid out over a period of years.  This is Japan, not Mali; the government has money.
t1_dtgzjiy	0	*	Nothing as bad or as comprehensive as the US; The Nazis based *their* eugenics program off of what the US was doing.
t1_dulgoeb	0	*	Did you spend any time watching him or spending time with anyone who watched him?
t1_dur6xxl	1	*	Oh of course, the story is truly disgusting. I hope my silly pedantry hasn't taken anything away from our understanding of that. 
t1_dsbqxu2	1	*	That's an interesting thought, royal families are always mishmashes of nationalities, but I always think of them in terms of their....kingdom(?)

t1_dtmfhjr	1	*	Before you get too worked up, [here's an article you should probably read.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm)
t1_duui8fp	1	*	Exactly! They are the USA equivalent in the east.
t1_duv5ne1	1	*	Considering East Germany was the most advanced of the Communist states, that's a pretty big worry.
t1_duul3q4	1	*	Not even a mention of Cod War 1 or Cod War 2... smh
t1_duulbhk	1	*	>What does IT have to do with this  They all float now?
t1_duvfkmj	0	*	The world needs less Americans and a war with China would definitely deliver this. Thoughts?
t1_duuqw64	1	*	This happened in the mid 1970's. The Polish ship tried to make a run for international waters so it could not be arrested. 
t1_dux0rww	1	*	I said Argentinian many times, which one do you mean? 
t1_duum08n	1	*	I hope he didn't shot down Elon Musk's Roadster then.
t1_duvdsme	1	*	You mean land reclamation? Yeah, it's a thing. 
t1_duv7ufq	1	*	Chinese trawlers poach all over the world.
t1_duuin4t	0	*	Hardly a bunch of dumb dudes in a boat - you any idea how far from China Argentina is??
t1_duw4f68	0	*	I would almost say that Spain began and continued that war. 
t1_duvn3ol	1	*	Fun fact: this was completely unrecorded in the media due to Britain's inability to write Icelandic names. 
t1_duugzzv	1	*	Isn't that the point if the Monroe Doctrine?
t1_duuyacs	1	*	Im surprised China is even out that far. Youve got the entire Pacific Ocean between them and South America 
t1_duub8pk	1	*	They dont encourage but they sure as hell dont condone. When Chinese fishing vessels get caught by other countries, THEN they have something to say. 
t1_duuf2rc	0	*	I say just seize every illegal fishing vessel and arrest the crew
t1_duumhc1	1	*	it's people!!
t1_duuw270	0	*	The Argentinians are the ones that need the sub training.
t1_duuppfh	1	*	Canada has extremely rich fishing grounds, because of aggressive fisheries management, Poland does not.
t1_duufg59	0	*	More of the world not taking chinas crap. 
t1_duunmpt	1	*	You mean they just let some guy manufacture, mount, load, aim and fire the guns?
t1_duv29kl	0	*	The second point of the Chinese having leverage over them is the main reason.
t1_duu8utg	1	*	It could... Given our current President.  However, I was actually thinking of everyone in the continent(s).
t1_duuec1o	1	*	It is becoming hilarious at this point how irrelevant the topic is to Trump, but someone blames him for it.

t1_duwkd4p	1	*	Im not saying fight the coast guard but read about the recent incident in Alaska. Nutjobs are ramming boats to keep competition away. You certainly need to be able to defend yourself from such people.

t1_duup52b	1	*	There was also a fishing war between Great Britain and Iceland

t1_duv67uq	0	*	In English is Falkland, in Spanish is Malvinas  Or do you say Deutschland instead of Alemania?
t1_duukljf	1	*	They have a lot of people to feed and fish is one of the staples of billions of people.
t1_duuq760	1	*	Fun fact, the aircraft carrier in question, was originally sold to Brazil by the French. It has since been decommissioned and Brazil will be without an aircraft carrier until at least 2025. 
t1_duup8gn	0	*	It's every scuba divers' dream to go diving in the Galapagos. Trust me, I'm one of them.

t1_duutj66	0	*	so im assuming Ecuador doesn't produce much oil?  
t1_duint4l	0	*	Liberated lol literally anyone in the caribbean would kill to have the status of puerto rico. Being born with a US citizenship is a goddamn lottery ticket.

t1_dtx0wig	0	*	If you are going g to support that officer better don't use a account full of NSFW and incest posts.
t1_ds3gsz0	1	*	 Power is given and it is not given; if you want to have a say, you have to take the power.  once you have it, then you convince others to let you keep it. 
t1_ds2z3ff	1	*	The person you are responding to stated a fact. It's inappropriate to call them a fucking moron as a result. 
t1_du0rxfm	0	*	Love the fake, brigaded downvoting of my comment against two mass-murdering dictators.  This is clearly a sore point.
t1_dtzrgn8	1	*	Oh i should've looked better at the article, my bad
t1_dtzybik	0	*	Honestly, the type of dude who would make a child smoke a carton of cigs, would probably be the same type of dude that would rape his own daughter if he found out she's a lesbian.
t1_dtzywkd	1	*	So, they're basically raping with impunity.   Aren't humans wonderful?
t1_du02n6l	1	*	Thats not part of their sentence. Do you want that written in to our law? Convicted felons are to be raped weekly in prison. Who should carry out this sentence? Prison guards?
t1_dtzx5mz	1	*	And you can cure the perpetrators with a useful thing we call bullets
t1_du138bp	1	*	As are rehabilitation facilities for teens, I guess (like Tranquility Bay etc.).

t1_du17537	0	*	They should be legal but only for those who want it. I'm against forced conversion. 
t1_du0znyu	1	*	Nah you're only gay if you're at the receiving end... That's what they will tell you

t1_dsh1c7n	0	*	the only thing that is consistently good is a sour cream glazed donut.  not even all donuts, just that specific one
t1_dshlpd5	1	*	That's funny. In the US the east coast loooooooves dunkin' donuts and the west coast doesn't care.
t1_dsgy9v5	1	*	Its not American ownership that fucks things up, it is multinational conglomerate ownership. 
t1_dshf1x9	1	*	 Most franchises offer two paid 15 minute breaks, and a half hour for lunch, unpaid. 
t1_dshjgbw	1	*	All the old people go there is small towns because its the only option.
t1_dsh6rx6	1	*	i was told like 15 years ago that Tim Hortons donuts were all frozen and reheated. I thought they had always had shitty donuts... Did they change that practice? 
t1_dsh8xol	1	*	McDonald even started using tim hortons old coffee supplier after burger king bought tim hortons and changed they're coffee.
t1_dsgx1ev	1	*	No, as in Boblaw
t1_dshcbjr	0	*	It was more of a joke 
t1_dsh9xhe	1	*	You aren't being truthful - Vancouver is just as loaded as any other Canadian city. 
t1_dsh53iq	1	*	lower the fuckin taxes for minimum wage earners! Her crazy drastic plan to increase minimum wage over 20% is proving to screw over a lot of people. 
t1_dsgw9eh	0	*	The small summer price increase comes nowhere close to the huge clusterfuck this wage increase is. 
t1_dsh3naq	1	*	I was born here and don't like either of them. I can at least respect the latter though. Either way, I hope they don't try and deport me to where I came from.
t1_dshrcrc	0	*	Theres literally the Employment STANDARDS Act to follow. It says 30 minute unpaid break.
t1_dsh8od9	1	*	Yup, Timmy's had a national following, if this is the way they are going to treat their employees perhaps they should go out of business.
t1_dsh5nko	1	*	I work at Tim's and they told me it was because of bees and pests lmao
t1_dsh412e	1	*	$14 minimum wage seems pretty high and food services typically run on tight margins.
t1_dsh04h7	1	*	everything is microwaved to be cooked, the coffee is horrible and the sandwiches have never been good.  Dear god what are you eating in the States?
t1_dsp7z9s	1	*	thanks-this makes more sense now. 
t1_dsgzeil	1	*	This is so totally true about Tim's as a brand - in particular the last paragraph. Tim's is very much woven into the culture of Canada, but they are definitely lagging behind in terms of quality. 
t1_dsh6o5d	1	*	The Frozen donuts has been going on since 2002.  
t1_dshsj7w	1	*	It isn't skilled labor though.  It's entry level work for someone with no skills or education.  
t1_dshm6fo	0	*	Depends where I guess, me and my wife LOVES then and we get multi times a week. Starbucks is gross to us.
t1_dshgzt6	1	*	Keep in mind that incentives are important. If CEOs couldn't get seven private jets, nobody would ever have coffee!
t1_dsgy04e	0	*	Canadian here, and Tim's coffee is fucking awful.  It's only my last resort if I'm really craving for a coffee, my coffee maker broke, and there's nothing else in a 30 mile radius. 
t1_dshctj9	0	*	Try living on minimum wage in a place like Toronto.  Even 15 isnt enough to really get by.
t1_dsgwiuf	1	*	City life
t1_dsh3e3n	1	*	And because for many of us, they are the only thing open for our 430 am commute. I much prefer McDonalds coffee, but you cant go more than a city block before hitting another timmies. 
t1_dsgyw38	1	*	Tim's is the Dunkin' Donuts of Canada. Both are really poor quality yet people will stand with them 'til death. And this is why they will continue to exist.
t1_dsgxfwm	1	*	Brazil is still in the South American continent. So it is still technically correct to call them American owned. 
t1_dsh81f9	1	*	Might have something to do with their coffee tasting like someone put a cigarette out in it
t1_dsgz3j2	0	*	> I can literally walk to 4 within an hour from where I live.  You must live in rural Saskatchewan. 
t1_dsh4uei	1	*	They aren't even a Canadian franchise anymore, it's owned by Burger King. If you want to support the only remaining one you go to Second Cup! Timmies can go bankrupt for all I care.
t1_dsgxwnb	0	*	If anyone is in the Ottawa area, Bridgehead is a great alternative.
t1_dsh45jn	1	*	>  I can literally walk to 4 within an hour from where I live.  Only 4?
t1_dsh5uuj	1	*	You realize due to the payroll tax it is mostly close to being doubled? 
t1_dshl79d	1	*	McDonalds bought out Timmys coffee bean supplier as well I believe. One of the major reasons their coffee quality went to shit. 
t1_dsh1fmq	1	*	Even up north.  Prince George is like that
t1_dsi6smt	1	*	It is an industry lobby and they cry wolf every time minimum wage has gone up.. 
t1_dshcwvm	1	*	Don't forget changing their carrot muffin formula as well, that's a pretty big mistake that Tim Hortons has pulled recently.   Still salty. 
t1_dsh8swt	0	*	Whats hilarious is that if this boycott actually works its going to cause the employees of that Tim Hortons to lose their jobs.  
t1_dsh4fiw	1	*	I just really like their iced coffee, its stilll warm but cold at the same time. 
t1_dsifphe	0	*	You do realize they were making a South Park reference right?
t1_dsgxadk	1	*	Im not sure if this was recent, but their sandwiches got so much worse. Their breakfast sandwiches are terrible and make McDonalds look gourmet. 
t1_dshzl8j	1	*	Thats exactly how I felt about DD.   Always wanted to try it and it was a let down 
t1_dsh3g0j	1	*	Timmy's is cheaper though, yah Starbucks has better coffee, but it is also like 2.5x the price.  
t1_dshh8hs	1	*	Ironically no one calls them anything but Superstore. I tend to forget the actual name
t1_dsgx7mn	1	*	The Kids are being a bit stupid but it is sadly good business.
t1_dsgqn5e	0	*	But won't somebody please think of the shareholders? /s
t1_dsgrmxc	1	*	Or both were required.... It's like you didn't even listen to what they said. 
t1_dshd2sr	1	*	Tim Hortons coffee has the unique taste of what can be described as burnt water lol Starbucks, and McDonalds coffee even, are miles (or kms lol) ahead! 
t1_dshmfx6	0	*	Living wage, does not merely mean you can manage living off it. It's more about making a living with some breathing room between you and poverty.
t1_dsh34yd	1	*	Location and number of franchises is a big part of their ability to survive. People just assume there is a Tim's near by because 90% of the time there is. 
t1_dsi0gyb	1	*	Before they were partnered with Wendys, they were decent.  After. absolute garbage
t1_dsh25t9	1	*	You tend to appreciate them more after answering an after hour page for a system breakdown at 3AM...
t1_dsh5z9m	1	*	actually it's owned by 3G capital, which is a brazillian investment firm. So technically no?
t1_dsh91cm	1	*	Its never been the same since America bought us out. They stopped selling Coca-Cola!
t1_dsh1g7y	1	*	What are you talking about? There are like 7 Tim Hortons downtown alone.  There might not be as many as sbux but they're definitely number 2 in Vancouver still. 
t1_dsgx3by	1	*	Check out his law blog!
t1_dsh3ztz	1	*	Tim's is also hanging on because they are everywhere. I drive 15 mins to work and pass by 2. I have to drive about 10 mins out of my way to go to any other coffee shop. 
t1_dsgxodw	0	*	whether you believe that or not, you're wrong. Look at any Tim Hortons in any town at any point in the day, its packed. 
t1_dsh73w6	1	*	As long as they wrap their brand in the Canadian flag, they'll catch flak for all the things that happen under their brand, whether it's franchisee or not.
t1_dsgx3jh	0	*	Some of us believe that our civilization is advanced enough that every job should have breaks and benefits...
t1_dsh2nsr	0	*	They'll raise prices but then keep the wages stagnant. It's how my (California, US) government handles taxes/spending too.
t1_dshktod	0	*	I disagree. If the backlash is strong enough against one company, the others will think twice about following suit.
t1_dsh1o03	1	*	Nope, just one thing. And we're lifting closely, guy...
t1_dsh6y0l	1	*	But the BOC says there is NO inflation
t1_dsh7oli	1	*	They got rid of fresh in store over 15 years ago. They switched it when I was working there. Theyve also always treated their workers like shit. Terrible company inside and out.
t1_dsh3grk	1	*	> more sophisticated coffee  Who knew people would prefer places with more flavour options beyond diarrhea
t1_dsgxven	1	*	No, in Canada you're allowed to have silly notions about the Hip.  Timmies sucks.
t1_dsgxuox	1	*	This is analogous to Dunkin Donuts and New England, imo, but it would seem Canadians are more honest about it.
t1_dsh5enl	0	*	I like their paninis myself
t1_dshbmyf	1	*	In first two fucking sentences even! At least fuckin' wait till yer done the rant bud, jesus.
t1_dshdmkx	1	*	Wow lol, XL here is 2.50 and we lost paid breaks a year ago.
t1_dsgxkln	1	*	I'll accept 8 mill a year and be pleased. Probably make a better cup of coffee while I'm at it.
t1_dshcrwo	1	*	Go a bit more north. I'm from the Lower Mainland as well, but anything past the Oakanogan is crazy for Tim's. Every morning and their drive thru's go halfway around the block. 
t1_dsgynha	0	*	Who needs employee rights, right? /sarcasm 
t1_dsj12kd	1	*	Well, how about you stop selling yourselves?
t1_dsgy8op	1	*	Timmies coffee has gone down during the years. A few years ago, it would be my go to coffee but nowadays I prefer McDonalds coffee over Timmies coffee. 
t1_dsh7fcb	1	*	If they're not careful they'll just get bought up by Disney.
t1_dshk6rr	1	*	I think their chilli is alright.  I wouldn't write home about it but on a cold day it's nice.
t1_dsgx649	1	*	No. As in Theodore Loblaw. Sorry :(
t1_dsgz2nj	0	*	Seize the means of doughnut production! 
t1_dsh4mgm	1	*	haha, but on wednesdays they're allowed to catch up and buy a XL
t1_dsh4l5f	1	*	Not sure about where you live but in Alberta my medium coffee at McDonald's is cheaper than the Tim's medium, I never get a large so maybe it is more. 
t1_dsh4o5d	1	*	1 store? nope. there are already 2 stores here in Windsor alone that I know of that are taking away breaks, tips and or/benefits. Yes, they are franchises, no this is not an isolated event. 
t1_dsgy54x	1	*	You know who else has good chicken noodle soup? Chick-Fil-A. I was rather sick recently and sampled around. Would definitely recommend.
t1_dsh7f56	1	*	Same here. Once lived I  a place in Ontario were they had two Timmys across the street from each other. Moved to Alberta and Timmys were harder to find.
t1_dsheqw8	1	*	dont forget they have small stores in pretty much every small populated area serving everyone 
t1_dsgybj0	1	*	I thought it was happening in one franchise *owners* stores, its the heirs of the original founders so they own a bunch.
t1_dsgz74m	1	*	Second Cup is really good coffee, eh? 
t1_dshgg9f	1	*	Mcdonalds coffee is also objectively better. I go there anyways, so the $1 any size coffee promotions they run all the time for a month at a time is just a bonus to me. 
t1_dsh4eeb	0	*	Wow, didn't know that.  I worked at Domino's for 6 years.  I saw people taking 'smoke breaks', which I always thought was B.S.  But never heard of required 'paid breaks'.  
t1_dshk1rc	1	*	If you need to earn more there are two solutions: 1) Get another job. 2) Get a better paying job. It's that simple. 
t1_dsh15ln	0	*	Well then i stand corrected. Everyone i spoke to has never even heard of benefits being offered there. I used to work there, alot of my friends too and nothing. 
t1_dsgvva3	1	*	This happened to the store I worked at in 2014 when minimum wage increased then. It may not be all stores but at this point a large amount of them have adopted this policy.
t1_dsgzyce	1	*	While anecdotal, I would say 9/10 people I know that drink coffee say McDonald's is better than Tim's. I have even heard people say 7-11 has better coffee. Again, all hearsay, but still interesting.
t1_dsh198d	1	*	Enh, maybe not in the city, but once you hit the tri-cities and go further east, Tim's is still a big deal. Soccer and hockey family haven in the suburbs.
t1_dsh7ri3	1	*	Oh...  Almost no one gets those.  I know I'd be pissed if I had one and someone took it away, but I've never had one.
t1_dsgz3o3	0	*	Can't be owned by Americans if you don't sell out. Tell your countrymen to value the business and legacy they've created over the ever almighty $$$$. 
t1_dsgxj5n	0	*	They also own Burger King and Popeyes chicken iirc. 
t1_dsheb8q	1	*	Sounds like what's going on with Dunkin Donuts in the states. They haven't had fresh donuts in years
t1_dsh21n4	1	*	I like the tone shift in this post. 
t1_dsgzipw	0	*	You are confusing the corporation with a franchisee owner. Try to learn the difference. 
t1_dsh03x4	1	*	You are on thin ice with that comment about the Hip, buddy. Even if it is used as an explanation. 
t1_dshnjyb	1	*	Fucking lol. Second cup and Starbucks is where you get your coffee? You people have no idea what real coffee tastes like.   Starbucks.... you gotta be kidding me
t1_dshc22v	0	*	Next time go for some real maple syrup. You can get them in fancy bottles all over the place and it's amazingly tasty, very Canadian, and can get unique glass bottles as a keepsake. 
t1_dsgxcpg	1	*	Well, Brazil is an American country by definition, isn't it? Sure, many people use it synonymously with the US, but... U0001f601
t1_dsgxsrh	1	*	Implying the will get it right the 2nd time, 3rd time or nth time. 
t1_dsha2av	0	*	$11.60
t1_dsgzgcm	1	*	It's Dunkin Donuts if it were called Stars n' Stripes.
t1_dshi2jm	1	*	I've worked at Tim Hortons in Alberta for a while and we lost paid breaks in February last year.
t1_dshclr9	1	*	also because they are absolutely everywhere in Canada, and most of the time there is only a tims near. Tims has really fallen off. 
t1_dsh113h	1	*	Look up the definition of corporation, it definitely has nothing to do with giving up profit margins in order to fund government initiatives. 
t1_dsgxhwq	0	*	A few other reasons exists; Not liking John Candy and having a secret love affair with Nickelback.
t1_dshcn50	0	*	Pissing isn't a break.
t1_dsh4d0w	1	*	Clearly businesses should only exist to please the public and not the shareholders/owners who expect a profit ^^/s
t1_dsh8b9e	1	*	Could be. The one near me just totally renovated the whole thing. Which is either a really good sign, or a *really* bad one
t1_dsh75vg	0	*	Do you have any idea how much this corporation has managed to attach themselves to our national identity? Foreigners think of only 3 things about Canadians: Hockey, maple syrup, and Tims
t1_dsh2l39	0	*	But everyone's talking about Canada & Canadians not realizing that lots of Canadians have already had this for a long time, but all the outrage is happening now.
t1_dsi4qnn	1	*	A shame McDonald's doesn't have donuts.
t1_dsgyp62	1	*	you're already green lit to get the fuck out with that last bit, guy. 
t1_dshcp7n	1	*	>This stripping of paid breaks is happening at only 1 store  it's actually more than one, increasing by the day
t1_dshn03v	1	*	2.19 for an XL? I pay 2.15 here in this shithole in New Brunswick for a Large.  
t1_dsgz09j	0	*	Some Tim Hortons don't give breaks where I am but it is definately illegal, multiple co workers called the labor board and nothing happens though
t1_dshevf1	1	*	The problem is, Tim Hortons outnumbers Mcdonald's big time, and for most they will go to the most convenient spot.   
t1_dt7wsnq	0	*	I mean, when I was 15, I was getting murdered all the time and I turned out fine. So, what's the problem?   /s
t1_dt9sbzn	1	*	Thanks for commenting.  I did not know that.    Cheers. 
t1_dt89m1u	1	*	Yeah, if I was innocent I'd rather live my entire life in a shitty Pakistani prison than just be straight up be killed.
t1_dt8odxa	0	*	OR maybe they will stop fearing it and live their lives to the fullest. Death is coming one way or another.
t1_dt7o03w	1	*	Their turbans are funky lookin. Not like the cool long Pakistani ones. 
t1_dt7odep	1	*	This is why discourse is so god damn difficult these days. Someone disagrees with the death penalty and cites its uselessness as a deterrent: OH SO I GUESS YOU MUST LOVE PEDOPHILES THEN
t1_dt8i253	1	*	This isn't a debate or a discussion of East vs West.          But if you want to go there, then yes, state sponsored religion used to be a problem in the West as well.  (Think Crusades)       
t1_dt7o9pr	1	*	I guarantee false accusations and political opponents will flood public executions.   It will be labeled pedophilia, but the message to opponents of the current political power will be clear. 
t1_dt7r7wy	1	*	If anyone ever wonders why pedophiles don't seek any help until it is too late, this is probably a good example of why.
t1_dt7z3sl	1	*	That's something done in some rural parts of Afghanistan. By the way, neither Afghanistan nor Pakistan are part of the Middle East.
t1_dtgf04m	1	*	Lie repeated multiple times becomes truth.

t1_dslut3j	1	*	Yeah! Trump killed more civilians with drone strikes in 9 months than obama did in 8 years. Way more efficient! Black president is low energy! Sad!

t1_dsm1nvc	1	*	even if it's not literally mean-spirited it also tells something about the perception that those people have of who and who isn't a native citizen. 
t1_dsmng7j	0	*	Oh, definitely understood.   I feel sorry that these people are represented internationally by this man. 
t1_dsm1n7h	1	*	And he was actually somewhat competent at his job. But a nightmare for corporate HR.

t1_dslyyxd	0	*	Considering how much people hate Trump and the sheer amount of times these types of news reports end up being wrong, why do you think it's real?

t1_dslx8dv	1	*	Their complaints would me nothing at that point. We've seen their best solution already.
t1_dsm00dz	1	*	If I ask where you're from, it's always because I'm curious about hometowns, not ethnicity or country of origin. If a Asian person said they were from Houston, I'd ask them about Texas shit.

t1_dslw06d	1	*	Not at all confirmed, its from annonymous sources.
t1_dslytc3	1	*	I'm a white dude. Similar thing happened to my wife. She was born in Hawaii, family is Japanese. I got a you're not really American vibe from the comment. 
t1_dsm12og	0	*	Kayne would be worse than Trump. He once said that his biggest regret is not being able to listen to his music live.  The last time a man had this much ego he was the Fxfchrer of Germany.
t1_dsm0spg	1	*	I'm a white dude and I totally get why it's a big deal. Sorry a lot of people are such dumbasses...
t1_dsm25o8	0	*	No coming from the rest of the world, lthe damages is already done...even before Trump. The USA has done an awful lot of shitty stuff and we know now that this can happen again...
t1_dsm181d	1	*	Fellow American here How did we let this cheese puff get elected.
t1_dsly9an	1	*	It's the latter.

t1_dsm1z7f	0	*	I don't get why so many people think nationality and ethnicity are the same thing. You are rightfully American as a nationality, but it's impossible to be American as an ethnicity. 
t1_dsm04gj	0	*	But why skulls?

t1_dslw55s	1	*	What's with all these surprise police I've seen around recently? Something doesn't need to be surprising for it to matter. It's important that Donald's behavior is normalized as little as possible.

t1_dudxy6h	1	*	You do realize that the FDA is one of the primary reasons why competitors are prevented from undercutting this shit?
t1_due0n1c	1	*	Lol I work for them. Feel so hated now.
t1_dudsifo	1	*	Government hands drug company a monopoly. Drug company abuses monopoly. Free market blamed by internet morons.  Are you fucking serious?
t1_dudrptn	0	*	I dont think its a free market. The govt protects pharma with legistlation.

t1_dudsnhi	1	*	> ~~immoral~~ illegal to attack and steal it from them  Morality is questionable...
t1_dudyo0p	1	*	Some would say that the monopoly on the patent is regulation and the governments fault.  
t1_dudu0jf	0	*	Because it's their fault they got cancer? /s.  American healthcare is good if you have insurance, if not, you're fucked. 
t1_dudw22i	1	*	Well part of the reason is because it isnt a free market. FDA approval takes years. There is less incentive to compete.
t1_due0w6w	1	*	Used to work in a pharmacy. When a patient couldn't afford that, the pharmacist said they can take the two separately, but at the same time, for the same result 
t1_due3the	1	*	Psychopaths lining their pockets and regulators helping them do it.

t1_dudotc2	1	*	 Naw they just made it super addictive.
t1_duds74z	0	*	Not really. America doesn't actually have a free  market.  Not in most industries anyways, definitely not in pharma. 
t1_dudw8xz	0	*	Regardless of industry and regardless of monopolies, all prices are always regulated by ~~what people are willing to pay~~ whatever price will make the most profits.
t1_dudx7dy	1	*	Been to America many, many times and in all sorts of areas. If they don't even have healthcare then I don't see what everyone is bragging about around that country.
t1_dudwrbs	1	*	I really liked that docu series. I wish it had more episodes!

t1_dudoszh	0	*	Its just Nexium and Aleve. So... Profit?
t1_dudzcet	1	*	They added some antacid to it.
t1_due7o4f	1	*	And in this case it is for a well established compound of drugs, not new research.
t1_due3sun	1	*	The argument made is that healthcare is not a right but a service. 
t1_dudtwz4	1	*	The problem with the free market fix here is monopoly and patents.

t1_dswdup8	0	*	Turkey isn't exactly the ideal US ally. Beat up peaceful protesters on the embassy lawn much?
t1_dswjco4	1	*	ty
t1_dswbpoo	1	*	Syrian Army has already shot down Turkish Jet in the past.
t1_du70emm	0	*	So nothings really changed other than making it more acceptable/palatable to continue the paradigm with more comforts.
t1_dsoduip	1	*	I think people who get offended by it want to be offended.
t1_ds4u1z5	1	*	Credit card security versus convenience of use are always at odds with each other. 
t1_dsfdfna	1	*	Really? So sad. 
t1_dst83px	1	*	This is going to UNRWA, which also operates in Gaza.
t1_dssjg41	0	*	I'm german and I want the majority of europe back that was stolen from us after 1941. /s
t1_dst5qs7	1	*	True but why does everyone forget about Christians, there is three major religions in that area. 
t1_dssiukb	0	*	The point of Israel is for it to be a Jewish ethnostate. Having 10-20% minority is tolerable, but risking the majority is a non-starter. 
t1_dst48o9	0	*	Honestly, at this point I'd be happy with ANY solution as long as the senseless killing and hate ceases. 
t1_dstg6u5	1	*	Extend this idea to all countries in the Middle East and I'm on board.
t1_dss8rbj	1	*	As clever as cyclone bomb
t1_dst6xbw	0	*	But the majority of Israel do not support those actions - nor does the government.
t1_dss80ih	0	*	That's because US loves Israel over the Palestinians. 
t1_dst4851	0	*	You are supposed to give the source when you quote something, aren't you? This isn't from the article.
t1_dssc1uy	1	*	Why can't they simply learn from Puerto Rico, accepted their fate and thus no longer remain a 'shit-hole' country. /s
t1_dst9ei1	1	*	To be fair it was safe for Jews and Christians before Israel was made?
t1_dst3z2l	1	*	Or a sports stadium could get an extra closet.
t1_dtasavv	0	*	I'm pretty sure the murder of unarmed civilians is a war crime. 
t1_dtal9od	1	*	8 refugees since 2009, you think that's plenty?
t1_dtbh74s	0	*	Because religion is religion, reality is reality. What some bronze and parable says about immigration is not exactly what I'd base a national policy on.
t1_dtat8fs	1	*	Antisemitism!!!!!
t1_dtbdkes	0	*	I do, I know multiple Eritreans now living happily in Ethiopia.
t1_dtar91b	1	*	There are far more good people than bad. I would argue that migrants with families are better people than the ones who toe the line, because they are willing to do anything for their loved ones.
t1_dtbdxwa	1	*	I don't know if jews were slaves or not, but we do know they didn't build the pyramids.
t1_dsek1r1	1	*	Im with you. Alas, the droll and sardonic tone intended never carries through text. 
t1_dtflf3k	0	*	Tepidly.   Not enthusiastic about secularism are you?.  Are you tepid about human rights and freedom of speech too?
t1_dtfqo4h	1	*	Prison sentences if caught.

t1_dv2e6yo	0	*	Yep international as in everywhere bar america, people can shoot the shit outta Trump.
t1_ds3kwzy	1	*	The tuition of dentistry is very expensive in Taiwan FYI. 
t1_ds3fpjr	0	*	Paying for university education of two sons can be really expensive, especially if one of those is dentistry.  As far as I know dentistry education in USA can easily cost 500k+ for single person...
t1_ds3iiop	1	*	You should always read everything before you sign your named on the dotted line.  
t1_ds3j8w9	0	*	I'm sure bringing a baby into it will make the relationship better.

t1_ductmco	1	*	Best comment I've read all day. 
t1_dtqmiie	0	*	> they have evidence oozing out of every crack.  Funny, could you provide some?  I seem to have missed it for the last year of investigation.
t1_dsqn3rp	1	*	It always pays to be the opposition.
t1_dsq2t8p	0	*	Everyone wants to be a victim for some reason. When/why did people stop having pride and strength of character?  Now people pursue victimhood, just another negative of social media?
t1_dsr1uz6	1	*	Thank you 
t1_dsq7jej	0	*	Are you saying that they're *not* gonna milk it? :P
t1_dsqj0ci	0	*	Shes Canadian. 
t1_dsr04fc	0	*	A good percentage of muslims seem to be. Yet when i point that out i'm a racist on reddit. I swear, redditors are as stupid as muslims are violent and stone-agey.
t1_dsq1woa	1	*	Really shows everyone what she thinks of Caucasian people..
t1_dsq54l4	1	*	kinda like how this story was told as fact without any evidence
t1_dsq4hc4	1	*	Exactly. Does anyone really think it was her idea to report it to the police? To the media? She's an 11 year old who told a lie and outrage culture blew it up.
t1_dsq1f3r	0	*	I don't blame he as much as I blame the rabidly over offended and journalistically bankrupt media hacks who turned this into a thing.
t1_dsqlg1q	0	*	So what ? She is a rasist who faked hate crimes ...
t1_dsq1b9m	0	*	But her parents probably did.
t1_dsqhyun	0	*	Maybe she was influenced by someone with an agenda.
t1_dsq4iki	1	*	But that's probably in every thread, so someone calling it a hoax doesn't matter when it was a hoax this time
t1_dsq22sh	0	*	Yes, when I wrote that the counter was a  , no count showing, and was much farther down the page.  Glad it's getting significant coverage - usually retractions are seen far less.
t1_dsq1lhs	0	*	Does it? Seems pretty uncommon to me.
t1_dssoy5t	1	*	Probably because people are sheep. Whatever, I stand by what I said. People don't have to agree but its not like I don't know my own experience.
t1_dsqhrum	0	*	She will be bullied in horrific fashion by pretty much every kid in her school for doing this. Kids her age are merciless. 
t1_dsqgy3b	1	*	Wasn't there a trailer park boys episode about this?
t1_dsq0y7x	0	*	Good point, she was probably late for school and made up the story to avoid trouble. The fact that the police or media couldnt figure that out quickly is concerning (maybe they wanted it to be true)
t1_dsq7epx	1	*	Yes.
t1_dsr1490	0	*	But think about terrorist attacks. How come whenever there is one in the United States, it always turns out to be a Muslim and not someone of another religion?
t1_dsq61id	0	*	Dude its just an 11 year old kid.  She probably just didnt want to wear her hijab anymore and didnt expect to cause an international news story over it.
t1_dsqekm7	1	*	I still don't understand why an episode of Saved by the Bell got reported as news.
t1_dsq3skd	1	*	Not completely true. A lot of times it's endless little things that will never make the paper and get peoples attention. 
t1_dspzvsz	1	*	Unfortunately, when I've expressed the opinion that we just don't know and should wait to reserve judgement, I've sometimes been downvoted for it.  C'est la vie. :)
t1_dsr1ymk	0	*	No need to exaggerate there.  They are still going through with charges, they just chose not to go the hate-crime route.
t1_dsq2383	0	*	Yes, when I wrote that the counter was a  , no count showing, and was much farther down the page.  Glad it's getting significant coverage - usually retractions are seen far less.
t1_dsq8nzm	0	*	I would say this particular instance falls more into the politically motivated news category. 
t1_dsr61wp	1	*	Thank you
t1_dsqgdcf	1	*	I respect your appreciative attitude
t1_dsq71uc	1	*	normally Asian in the UK is used to refer to people from South Asia, not Middle Easterners (or East Asians for that matter).
t1_dsq0k04	0	*	I think 11 is a bit young to call someone a 'crazy bitch.' 
t1_dsq5o5p	0	*	What about we should give justice the time it needs to conclude the investigation all the facts are known?
t1_dsqbppk	0	*	Ahmed was later pictured with and congratulated by a wanted terrorist. 
t1_dsq2ytz	0	*	Hahahaha
t1_dssvkls	0	*	Believing in any religion automatically puts you in the unintelligent category. Humans have been on earth for over 200,000 years yet we're to believe that god didn't care until recently? 
t1_dsq8ocb	0	*	I think the pm should have stayed out of it until all the facts were known.
t1_dsr1r1b	0	*	I thought almost everyone on reddit was one of those people that wholeheartedly supported shit like that. You and 950+ people have reclaimed my hope for this website. 
t1_dsqeq5w	1	*	I think it is partly a cry for attention.  
t1_dsqhtvy	1	*	Liberals maybe, progressives no. Those are two different things.
t1_dsq8cdz	1	*	They do know it was an 11 year old girl just lying. They don't care though, they're here to push a narrative.
t1_dsq49te	1	*	Exactly! Couldn't have said it better and THIS is the lesson to be learned here, starting with the Prime Minister.
t1_dsq0f8i	1	*	If you put that way, I can agree 
t1_dsqi314	0	*	It's definitely Russia's fault, not any of the people who run massive, multi-billion dollar news orgs making day-to-day decisions... LOL.
t1_dsqe87o	1	*	Donald Trump didnt say anything about it U0001f937ufe0f
t1_dsq4pms	0	*	Its been upvoted a ton since they posted here about it.
t1_dsq1jl4	0	*	Even a broken squirrel finds a nut... or something
t1_dsqxi3n	0	*	Whats wrong with reminding the congregation about the plight of others abroad? Its not victim culture to solicit supplications for those suffering among you lol
t1_dsqh2at	1	*	It's a bit strange that an 11 year old girl's lie is now a left wing lie solely because the right wing people love it so much.  
t1_dsq4hoc	1	*	Should move to Haiti 
t1_dsq8p35	1	*	But it is a big issue, just so we are clear. 
t1_dsq93pw	0	*	Didn't he get a shit ton of money or something? 
t1_dsqeq99	1	*	Never cry shitwolf, Randy. 
t1_dsq7d57	1	*	Dont do that man. You know both sides create their own narrative by ignoring facts.
t1_dsq5oxp	1	*	> It also normalizes scapegoating someone else.  Humans don't need help doing that.  It comes naturally
t1_dsqaf1f	0	*	And? At that point you should know theres consequences for what you say. 
t1_dsqe1is	1	*	All crimes are hateful.
t1_dsq1puw	0	*	I don't care about Islam. I was talking about Social justice Warriors in general. But, okay, whatever. 
t1_dsq40me	0	*	It was my first assumption too based on the information that literally EVERY one of these cases that has made the national media in the US or Canada has turned out to have been a hoax. 
t1_dsq5wtk	1	*	The thing is, people defended it.  They defended attacking a little girl for being muslim.  That itself is an issue.
t1_dsq94ww	1	*	Yeah I guess she didnt accuse someone but this was probably one of the biggest news stories in the past week, kinda crazy that she didnt get a real punishment
t1_dsq2ohc	1	*	And it works like a charm every time.  
t1_dspwvhw	0	*	Let's keep the distinction between social justice and defense of murderous religion.
t1_dsqc1wf	1	*	Middle Easterners are Asian
t1_dsqw1hn	0	*	Her statement sounded rehearsed to me. And there is no way this was just a kid making up a story. Someone was behind this and they needs to be charged for hate-crimes. 
t1_dsq7l05	1	*	Wait, I thought facts were a *liberal* plot to discredit right-wing politics and hysteria was the only appropriate response?  I'm so confused.
t1_dsqlu98	1	*	What is the public benefit of publishing the story like this two days earlier?
t1_dsq29ir	1	*	If muslims treated us better we wouldn't have to dislike them. 
t1_dspzsk4	0	*	I doubt and 11yo was thinking that, must likely just was doing what the parents order her to do.
t1_dsq81uq	0	*	Why should an attack on a little girl be political at all?
t1_dsq2wgi	1	*	adults should know better. My 11 year old sister said a bear chased her into the house. we saw from the window a scruffy cat in the dark.
t1_dsq7ziu	1	*	I saw that information in the original stories before they knew it was a hoax.
t1_dsq5dyk	0	*	I don't think you understand how burden of proof works...
t1_dsq3fh3	0	*	Probably her parents who orchestrated it.
t1_dsqeqxt	1	*	Fuck her and her nonsense. 
t1_dsq1rhp	0	*	Yeah... no. It kind of is. Its the responsibility of any group to contribute to society and make other groups not hate them. Muslims are pretty bad at it tho. 
t1_dsq5mkx	0	*	Would your definition of hate crime include someone yelling white bitch and then punching you? If so add my mom as a victim to that list. 
t1_dsq40ob	1	*	Same thing with the air force academy racial slur incident. The black cadet lied about to get out trouble. Most of the reddit didn't see this retraction.
t1_dspzdsg	1	*	I'd imagine it started as uh-oh, I better say something other than the truth or I'll get in trouble, and it just snowballed from there.  Kids don't generally think ahead very well.
t1_dsq25ow	1	*	Why would he? It's worse for PR to admit it than just stay silent, because he can just bury it under the rug.
t1_dsqaax5	1	*	Islam and women's right don't go together.
t1_dsqp4b9	0	*	You're a little boi. 
t1_dsqot3c	0	*	Go DR3!
t1_dsq7p1c	0	*	I see why it might be bad, but don't they always do that?  Especially videos with a nice establishing shot of the school for reference?
t1_dsr136h	0	*	> NYT  *Failing NYT
t1_dsq35s5	0	*	I'm not American, so I was never really taught about it. I was mostly taught European history.
t1_dsq5kit	0	*	Yea fair enough. I'm sure they know. I'm just saying a mention of how they know would've been good. 
t1_dsqxlwo	1	*	It was an Asian guy that they described 
t1_dsq3181	1	*	Actually, that comment you quoted could be using a comma of elision. People who resent you[they] now resent you even more.  Not particularly probable, but possible.
t1_dsq3e3m	1	*	>Yes that's how ~~social~~ media works  
t1_dsq7u8m	1	*	6000? Seems rather small considering the hysteria of racist America. But yes, 6000 is 6000 too many. Not saying you're wrong
t1_dsqojou	1	*	No it was some Indian girl who got raped by her brothers boss, but she lied to make it look like a hate crime
t1_dsq109o	0	*	you must not be around many kids then. my nephew same age, knocked off his coke on carpet went running downstairs told my sister i knocked it over and hit him. 
t1_dsq2o6b	1	*	It's too much about appearances and identity politics with him, unfortunately.  I wish the NDP wasn't also going down this shithole path.
t1_dsqbc7r	1	*	Lol no thanks
t1_dsq625m	0	*	You may be referring to another article or source because I don't see that anywhere in this article. 
t1_dsqqvhh	1	*	Worse it makes the false accuser a target because who will believe them after one proven lie about the same thing?
t1_dsqx36i	0	*	She should go to jail, you think a child can't kill someone? Imagine if a child killed people you would just let them off?
t1_dsqedjs	0	*	That's a news article, not a debunking. 
t1_dt2zw98	1	*	Maybe we don't need to jam Black Mirror in to every comment thread 
t1_dt2vtda	1	*	No, he's the worst. Every time he's close to killing someone, he saves them instead!
t1_dt3797f	1	*	WOT IF NURSE KILLED RATHAH THAN SAVED? AND HIS NOSTRILS WERE COMPUTAH?
t1_dt3xua3	0	*	Because it would be kinda pointless and a crazy amount of work ?
t1_dt3tqml	1	*	There was one in Britain too, not sure how many she killed though.  Also, we had Harold Shipman a GP who killed hundreds of people.
t1_dtzot24	1	*	Exactly. 
t1_du1apx5	1	*	I'm guessing you read a lot of dumb things. 
t1_dtzqp7i	1	*	Clear cut now we can close the books on this one!
t1_dtzt69u	1	*	Kim Jong Un is very well liked too
t1_dtzs2ok	1	*	Then fly to Russia, and ask him nicely to stop. When he kills you and members of your family, wonder if you didn't ask nicely enough.
t1_dtzoe08	0	*	/u/liavz123 is one of those redditors who will downvote a really funny comment. Duh! Horses can't talk. Downvote!

t1_dsi381t	1	*	The public market price might be shaken with a very small event, at a right timing.
t1_ds62omo	1	*	That can be said about 9/11 too.
t1_ds50xk5	1	*	Actually Obama said that they didn't have evidence that Pakistan knew and they looked into it.  That's a different statement entirely.
t1_ds660qc	0	*	Thats the only mistake Pakistan Committed thanks to America's request in the 80s. America and Pakistan created the Taliban. Don't forget. Which also bit you in the ass. Remember 9/11?
t1_ds5mxyk	0	*	who?
t1_ds551aw	1	*	We're basically giving them money to arm up against India, our true ally. 
t1_ds54wsr	1	*	Of course they knew.  Imagine the backlash of their own people if they turned Bin Laden over to the US.  Someone as wealthy, wanted, and high profile as Bin Laden doesnt hide.  He's *protected*.
t1_ds6w5dg	0	*	The only thing Saudi Arabia is purging is political rivals. It's still a terrorist state.
t1_ds6pc4z	1	*	It was mostly a rhetorical question for the people that are like Yeah, fuck Pakistan, let's break this alliance!.
t1_ds5k0yt	0	*	> The Taliban ~~and other groups in Afghanistan~~ would not be able to operate without the tacit support of Pakistani Intelligence Services.  And who funded them into prominence in the first place?
t1_ds5tb7e	1	*	Instability in Afghanistan and India. Terror organisations is practically an arm of the state when it comes to terror attacks in India.
t1_ds50lx4	1	*	Hold on there, devil. 
t1_ds5log3	1	*	True, sometimes I just want to see if people get it.

t1_dsz1wk1	0	*	It seems like the vast majority of your posts are about Trump and how great he is... you're creepy, just like he is. I can see why he appeals to you. 
t1_dsyueqx	1	*	Trump said something about Shit holes....maybe paying 130k in Hush money to fuck a porn stars shit hole. Hey Christian trump voters: are you still supporting this cheetoh dust clown?
t1_dsz401u	1	*	Unless you are an Architect, she loves architecting. 
t1_dszkcgc	0	*	Something tells me that Trump isnt going to have any need for donations. Not because he is rich but because he should never be allowed to run for any kind of public office ever again.

t1_dt1mnhr	0	*	China is merely stepping back into the familiar vacuum of world leader. It had a century of shame and seeks to make amends. Let's all pray for an inward looking China.
t1_dt53d5s	1	*	No I haven't been to China, I like my organs where they are. Ohhh god! please don't down vote me!  My precious internet points... lol. Fuck off crybaby.
t1_dt1eys5	1	*	Member when the United States enslaved millions of people? 
t1_dt2w7sc	1	*	> Democracy is just consistently mediocre; never devastatingly bad that the country self-destructs, but never a beacon of paradise. It's stable  So, there was this thing called the Wiemar Republic...
t1_dt1bhyn	1	*	There is no comparison, unless you're an idiot.
t1_dt1cbce	1	*	But arent we a Representational Constitutional Republic, and not a democracy?

t1_dt19c53	0	*	It's a bit ridiculous to compare that to Tiananmen Square, where the government ordered tanks to fire on protestors and the government to this day outlaws the mention of it. 
t1_dt1fn0a	0	*	.... What? It has never been equal in the house. That's why the house exists.
t1_dt1b78p	1	*	You're comparing a sad mistake to years of actual murder. Are you aware that China starved a few million of its own people to death? (IIRC, the estimates are near 40-50 million people). 
t1_dt1mgxr	1	*	Always. Probably the most memorable game experience I have ever had was discovering technologies in that game - all due to that voice acting.

t1_dt1ac5m	1	*	Tao Te Ching and Art of War are bullshit fluff books popular in the west only because of weebs. Might as well read a fucking fortune cookie. Anybody who quotes that shit is full of it.
t1_dt19k97	1	*	Well, it sort of is being looted by oligarchs. Nowhere near as badly as Russia, but considering the anti-corruption campaign the party is on, there's definitely a decent amount of looting going on. 
t1_dt1de8q	0	*	America was a functioning nation before China took that roll, it will continue to function without it in that roll as well.

t1_dt1g86a	0	*	and america used to have black slavery and ethnic cleansing of natives   do you think bringing up historical atrocities is a relevant factor in comparing present day governments? 
t1_dt1byyo	1	*	Yeah theres literally no countries that have this and they definitely dont have functioning governments too. 
t1_dt1bx7u	1	*	That number is complete bullshit.
t1_dt1mhc4	1	*	Remember when the American South's economy was based on the forced labor of millions?  I remember.

t1_dt1is4c	1	*	Great comment and great quote. I just like to add that states like China are in so much trouble as postmodernism continues to hit them. They cant fend off all the influences of the world forever. 
t1_dt2a0iw	1	*	> I'd say Trump winning the presidency is a sign that our country is MORE democratic.  Because the guy with fewer votes won?
t1_dt1kvkv	0	*	Youre talking about people from impoverished Asian nations. Talk to someone from Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan. They would probably rather die than move to China.

t1_dt1lwzx	0	*	>Trump won because the Democrats supported a lizard person in a pantsuit.  Oh reddit and it's ad hominem attacks in place of structured, logical and detailed arguments based on objective facts.

t1_dt1a2qq	1	*	It looks like China is trying to grab at anything that makes their government look better compared to USA.
t1_dt1giic	1	*	How can the government have a shutdown when it has majority in house and senate?   That shit just cant be made up. 
t1_dt1aohi	0	*	Ive seen some in 7/11 a few weeks ago. They mustve done something to make them legal but i didnt buy any. 
t1_dt13wme	1	*	That isn't whataboutism, how many times do you want to comment that here?  >may have killed some protestors  Stop the propaganda and lies.
t1_dt29z2e	1	*	Pretty sure the corporate bribery effect is the greatest of them all!
t1_dt18tbo	0	*	Well, it happens in Belgium as well but that's beside the point.  What do you think happens in a shutdown? It really isn't a big deal. 
t1_dt223d7	1	*	> killing off millions of your own people.  Yet the population doubled in that time.  Hilarious, how little americans now.

t1_dv1s936	0	*	I was referring more to Asia/South America.  I do not support tariff's between the EU and US.
t1_dv1b31b	0	*	About as quality a post as Trump's tariffs on steel.
t1_dv256s4	0	*	And yet somehow your cows are the ones that caught deadly diseases.
t1_dv2re3y	1	*	should just put some absurd tariff on coal. it will have no effect on either economy, but will get a shitload of attention in the US because we fetishize coal mining for some reason.
t1_dv2fsuy	1	*	Right!  That all occurred in the last year, too huh?  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WINDtlPXmmE  Here, thats from the 70s.

t1_dsylrv9	1	*	Did you just drop a bunch of names without context ?

t1_dsv8y7q	1	*	Kim really doesn't have a choice other than eventual war and he saw what happened to Saddam and Qaddafi.  It won't start as full reunification, but any step in that direction right now would help.
t1_ds7vyph	1	*	Thank God for education...wait a minute.
t1_duo8hpv	0	*	So, if the u.s. intervenes in an election abroad, do you also consider that an act of war?
t1_dtpqdlj	1	*	The why is because they actually know how to farm and the country is out of food.
t1_dtpcgi1	1	*	Just because you haven't heard about it doesn't mean the media isn't reporting on it. 
t1_ds1n9ua	1	*	And why exactly quote the part that makes it look like I am talking about Bangladesh!

t1_dtq44z6	1	*	Nah.  I put a few there last summer just for fun
t1_dtq18vj	1	*	Spot on. The gay community in Toronto has been ringing alarm bells about missing men since as early as 2012. 
t1_dtqb161	0	*	What the fuck? Even I could conduct a search better than that. It's a shame because Toronto sounded like a great place to live other than the police and the Maple Leafs. 
t1_dtq2w8k	1	*	Gay men make up 2% of the population according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Gay villages / 'hoods make it easier for them to find each other.

t1_duhlk0g	1	*	Also, does he remember how fucking horrible the ice age was for life???
t1_duiglu2	0	*	Who was keeping records 300,000 years ago?  Written language only goes back to 3200BC.   Prior to European exploration in the 1500's anything about it is conjectural.  
t1_duhi9gl	1	*	So [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/) are wrong? Useless bunch of nerds!
t1_duhk552	1	*	We've been doing that for centuries. And it has only caused trouble and hardships for the rest of humanity. Fuck those idiots, they need to disappear.
t1_duhnqja	0	*	Unfortunately Greenland ice Sheet and glaciers all over the world are also losing ice.  And the Antarctic ice shields are looking less stable than they used to.

t1_duhk8xj	1	*	Most people dont read it, nor will they read anything else to further they own understanding of the issue. Basic color understanding aside that is. :-)
t1_duhmixn	0	*	Im sure. Serious question though: would marine plants grow better if it was water and not ice? Would they grow better in warmer weather?
t1_dum1ns4	0	*	Honestly, what's the long term plan for you folks in Arizona? I know it's always been hot there, but how high can temperatures get before people start leaving the state en masse?

t1_duhhdw1	1	*	Meh.  Can we add in that Duerte guy too?  I feel like we need somebody to mess with Texas.  If they don't let him in, we'll pull some old Liberal Tricks, and call them racists!
t1_duhnqvi	1	*	The US is so far right wing that they would say you are a liberal. 
t1_duhis33	1	*	You, sir, dont toe any party lines and use informed thinking and the analytical process to make decisions. You are a pragmatist. I wish that was a party. 
t1_dui06x2	1	*	Thanks for proving my point.
t1_duhjd1n	1	*	Russia and China too are getting new routes and resources
t1_duhdti6	0	*	No, they are the ones driving climate change for real. Destabilizing western democracies, a warmer Siberia and gaining access to arctic resources? What is there not to like?
t1_duhmcwj	0	*	he's responsible for whatever reddit doesn't like duh.
t1_duhglxs	1	*	Spain had already started colonizing Hispaniola by 1500ad, and the Dark ages is considered the start of the medieval ages, as it's the middle age bridging Rome with the Renaissance.
t1_duhlw10	1	*	1). Correct Im a human in (temporary) denial.  2). I want it to not be true, even for just a few hours.  3). Good call.  U0001f44dU0001f3fc  
t1_duj0uhh	1	*	Greenland ice would add 7 meters, Antarctic ice would add 60 meters.
t1_duhncvb	1	*	It's not never this rapidly though? The title of the post says at least 1500 years but that's a microsecond in the scheme of things.
t1_duijnoy	1	*	Climate change is real, its more the end result and models that I take with a grain of salt. They just recently admitted that their models miscalculated by double.  
t1_duhor5l	1	*	Well, the problem with that is... You're just assuming. No one has any idea what the Earth is capable of. 
t1_duhhy79	0	*	Honestly not like it's the worst idea but it's fucking funny coming from you
t1_duhicia	0	*	One other point to make - the world wasn't supporting 7.6 billion human sized mammals back then either.  The carrying capacity is diminished quite a bit within some of the cycle.
t1_duhlcy3	1	*	Two party system sucks buddy, i feel for ya
t1_duhuxjb	1	*	Burning them is way easier... Or, we're both tree haters here, right?
t1_ds7qclf	0	*	Your ignorance on this matter is whats scary. Please dont make a fool of yourself by trying to compare Pakistan with North Korea because you lost all credibility by doing so. 
t1_duqjeca	0	*	More likely it's not killing the flu because they don't require drugs to actually do what you claim in Japan.

t1_dsntkil	1	*	Be glad for Trudeau. No leader you will get is perfect. But as long he stands for you guys in times of need, that is what matters the most. Cheers from Czech Republic, wish us luck in elections!
t1_dsmxige	0	*	Yeah, but someone will challenge him in the primary on the grounds of broken promises (the Wall, Repeal and Replace, etc). It'll probably be ugly, and it's very possible Trump loses. 
t1_dsnntyr	1	*	But how do they keep doing it.  Reddit told me that the WTO was more powerful than any government.  
t1_dsn1ke6	0	*	And the Avro-Arrow.

t1_dtc2tp0	0	*	Ya fuck Norway with their foreign wars, freedom, and high standards of living.  They should be more like China.
t1_dtq9cu7	0	*	The thing is, this term is being used more often, the amount has more than doubled in the last couple years. The amount isnt too big (IIRC over 250 times last year), but the trend could be worrying. 
t1_dtq32a9	0	*	Is German nation guilty for Nazi crimes? I'm sure there was at least one person who did not support Nazis, so German people as a whole is unfair - right?
t1_dtqov3p	1	*	Most African Americans live in the deep south! What do you mean there was racism there before 1964?    /s obviously
t1_dtq486w	0	*	Everyone was ridiculously antisemitic before WW2. Lots of Jews lived in the US too, but then you learn about the views of Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford, and the lynching of Leo Frank.
t1_dtq5bty	0	*	I'm ambiguous about the law however in Germany you can go to prison for denying the existence of Holocaust. The law is nothing new to Europe

t1_dsnvouc	1	*	Report them. Make sure they know they are being reported
t1_dsmre4b	0	*	That's awesome. I've never seen visa/MasterCard less than about 1.7%. Amex was always 2.5%. Who's your processor, if you don't mind me asking?
t1_dsmwe6z	1	*	I'm talking about Uber's commission. Uber gets a % of the fare. It should be a flat amount per drop.
t1_dsmfkr4	0	*	Exactly the same thing with my corner shop...

t1_dsmppm1	1	*	I swear I've never been charged 50p when paying with android pay before...
t1_dsmjus8	1	*	Then they need to find a better bank, because I run credit cards all day long and I get charged a percentage.  
t1_dsnro6v	1	*	This is what Britain has been doing since joining. Implements an EU directive and takes the credit. No wonder nobody understands the EU in Britain when you realise the background of deceit 
t1_dsnacfn	1	*	Raiblocks, incredible.
t1_dsmi2ia	1	*	I see this all the time on take-out menus that get sent in in mail (in Canada).   Usually Asian restaurants offering like a 10% discount if you come pick it up or pay in cash or something like that.

t1_dsiisqd	1	*	Because they make shitload of money. So much that they will later just buy anyone who will start to make money.  That is how big companies roll and Exxon and few other oil ones are biggest fish.

t1_du1aayy	1	*	Well, you are wrong. Kim Jong Il tore down a heavy water reactor cooling tower in exchange for lowering sanctions. Did it work long term? No. But to outright declare they don't care would be wrong.
t1_du1ifqx	0	*	Is Kim not insane?

t1_dtgfmmd	1	*	How are your onions today?  Thanks for the reply.
t1_dsjq4is	1	*	Like every other country, the governments stance is being politicized to tap into the older, nationalist voter base.   A more apt analogy would be Trumps refusal to condemn white supremists
t1_dskidv0	1	*	Apart from Duterte? It's the thing that weighs the most.
t1_dsji0ja	0	*	Majority of Japanese people don't even know it happened lol

t1_dsjtcnx	0	*	Why must Japan receive a made-up story without the evidence?
t1_dsjwp48	0	*	But nowadays more and more South Koreans are learning and excelling in Mandarin and at the same time the Sinophobic attitudes are no longer intensified these days.
t1_dsjq23f	1	*	Internet tells the truth
t1_dsjjvrw	1	*	The Japanese government didn't pay, it was a private charity based in Japan that did. Also, they paid the women who could prove they were kept as slaves. Hard to have proof from 70 years ago 
t1_dskh7gp	1	*	They do have a whole fucking museum in Hiroshima just for that. And the most important thing is, US government never asked Japan to close it.
t1_dskht2o	1	*	It is illegal in most European countries.

t1_ducqij5	0	*	Hillary is like the patriots to the Russians. Whoever she was up against they would support.
t1_ducrb3c	1	*	The messier the primaries are the more damaged the general election candidate is. Not saying it was decisive, but I wouldnt call it barely relevant either. 
t1_dud5no6	1	*	Just look at his comment history. He's one of those trolls from the Internet Research Agency.
t1_dv3xb2g	1	*	No one is raised to become a nun or monk, especially these days.

t1_dsogwz1	1	*	Both.
t1_dso9gow	0	*	its not about that, its about people relying on one person. check some of the replies he gets, people are literally relying on him to keep them updated. He has a life too. 
t1_dsod3bo	1	*	You're a sad fucking lib.
t1_dus9s8r	1	*	The only REEEE here is REEEacting appropriately to a shitty image used as a source.
t1_ds8bslr	1	*	As cool and edgy as Trump's tweet about last year zero death. Sad you didn't get my point. 
t1_ds8co47	1	*	he was trying to point out that they provided the cheapest food and lodging possible, not making assumptions about filipino staple foods
t1_ds8x78z	0	*	If they could get away running their business with less staff, they would have done so already regardless of the minimum wage issue.
t1_ds8dp7v	1	*	Sorry but McDonalds coffee is shite.
t1_ds8xzjf	0	*	> heh, I remember my first job at minimum wage being about 7$/hour!  In the US state of Tennessee, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.  It's stayed the same for about 10 years now.
t1_ds8l2ys	1	*	tims wont lose business because they have kiosks. 90% of people get thier coffee and go.
t1_ds837wv	1	*	No, but we should.  2 wrongs don't make a right.
t1_ds9nbcg	1	*	Doesnt factor in taxes and govt fees which are taxes but called something different.
t1_ds8sj58	1	*	It wouldn't be so extreme if they where getting paid a decent salary from the get go.  
t1_ds8uu7a	1	*	Things might be different in the exciting, fast-paced world of Alberta fast food.  It weirded me out when I started getting real jobs and they gave unpaid lunch breaks.  
t1_ds87fln	0	*	They want to ban Tim Hortons so that people who work there can have benefits.  Yes its weird.
t1_ds998yf	1	*	Actually, Tim's changed coffee supplier after they were bought out. Their previous supplier is now providing McDonald's coffee, which is much better. 
t1_ds84j35	1	*	Makes you wonder why Wynne is paying attention to this instead of that then.
t1_ds8bxma	1	*	Yes. I work at one of their franchise locations.
t1_ds8wbh8	1	*	If you do that, might as well not even run a business /s
t1_ds9tmqe	1	*	> Shareholders can go a few quarters with a little less growth too.  They can, but they won't.  It's like gold fever with these people.
t1_ds9dsuc	1	*	They do.  It's Gavina , although still copackwd by mother parked.  Tims dropped gavina, McDonald's picked them up.  
t1_ds8erl0	0	*	Caffeine pill master race. 1 cent for the same amount as a tims/mcdonalds coffee. 
t1_ds9eubi	0	*	You can't expect employers to just absorb a 20% hike in wages over night without a change in the way they do business...
t1_ds94xpo	1	*	Not to mention the British Royal Mail being undersold by the Government, with anybody who was able to get a hand on the stocks making lots of money off them.
t1_ds8ycwe	1	*	Mine was $5.15 in 2007. Was difficult to live even without paying rent. This was in America though.
t1_ds8dup3	0	*	If they do that's more to do with the deals they make with the parent corp because QSR (the company that owns Tims) has been on an upswing for 3+ years already.
t1_dthjtxh	0	*	But Poland isn't asking Israel to do anything. 
t1_dss3n4o	0	*	overrated.

t1_ds4kkgo	1	*	You can be a funny weener, can't you? 
t1_ds4kfi9	1	*	The rocket hit a field. The previous 19 also missed. Keep in in context. Even the IDF aren't excited enough about one rocket to bother retaliating. So I'm not sure why it gets you so riled up
t1_duu056q	0	*	I agree. It probably wouldnt work in the U.S given its geographical factors, although it would be one hell of a move in the fight against drugs   EDIT: Added some words 
t1_dutxawt	1	*	A huge win for big pharma.

t1_dtd9dfy	1	*	China only recently took the #1 emitter spot. The US still leads in cumulative emissions
t1_dtdlix3	1	*	It's true that it's perhaps more applicable, but the name wasn't changed. Both terms originated at the same time.
t1_dtdb1aj	1	*	To be fair I've wanted to kick the shit out of myself multiple times.
t1_dtd3ujx	1	*	No need for the omg. no. Just no. you don't get it. Both sentiments can be true.
t1_dtd70o2	1	*	He probably just thought any agreement on climate change would be bad for coal miner jobs which was supposed to be a big deal for him.
t1_dtd0str	1	*	**FOISTED**
t1_dtcw4wz	1	*	You assume he listens to what anyone has to say.
t1_dtd20km	1	*	Yeah, except he's actually pretty damn smart. He just fumbled words often.
t1_dtd1cng	1	*	Let's give him a keychain or something like that saying HOORAY you saved the planet
t1_dtd1im3	1	*	It's the same with the Iran deal. A lot of people think that Obama's administration for way more than expected, but Conservatives and Trump gate it because Obama did it and it wasn't a war.
t1_dtd2lk5	1	*	I need a Trump doll that does this and I need it now.
t1_dtd14ir	1	*	Yeah ICE really hates those purple cunts.
t1_dtd38s7	1	*	Screw that, can the man form a coherent sentence? Ive yet to see evidence of this.
t1_dtd2bbo	1	*	Haha sadly it seems to be peak/late stage capitalism at its best. 
t1_dtdyagp	0	*	What on earth makes you think i voted for him? I most certainly did not. I'm ashamed of my country, im not ashamed of myself, i had no part in his being elected 
t1_dtd4e40	1	*	Did he say that?
t1_dtd3tu7	0	*	The constant use of adverbs is a sign of a poor style of language. 
t1_dtd0ssc	0	*	Obvious current America first! Future America last!
t1_dte91q6	1	*	It's better at tech billionaires.  Musk and Zuckerberg are a bit expressionless and they glitch occasionally, but overall they're astoundingly lifelike.
t1_dtcy9qu	1	*	Mar-a-Lago won't flood.   Tbh, that place becoming inaccessible due to sea level rise is the only thing I can think of for him to finally start doing something
t1_dtd31rf	1	*	Yep. Bush at least had a small amount of self awareness, shame and embarrassment. Trump has none which makes it all the more shocking to watch. 
t1_dtd1l16	1	*	Yeah, but the guy is nonplussed by real data. If it is not convenient for him, he will discredit it as Fake News.
t1_dtco9jz	0	*	Or he just appears that way.
t1_dtd1bfv	0	*	that last paragraph is so dang true. politicians and pundits and journalists aren't who we should be listening to when it comes to this issue. the science of it is all that matters.
t1_dtdxo7y	1	*	Trump is totally lacking in humility. His fake humble tone (e.g. when a disaster has occurred) is one of the most cringeworthy things about him IMO.
t1_dtcy3pi	1	*	Why don't you google it?  Just to be thorough
t1_dtdvqp5	1	*	Which part is not true?
t1_dtgbm2p	1	*	I'm with you on the facts. What makes you think I'm denying the fact of climate change? But stopping it? Unfortunately it appears there is nothing we can do to stop it.
t1_dtd4mgr	1	*	I used to be an adventurer like you, until I took a Trump to the ear.
t1_dtd2l3t	1	*	Provide proof. 
t1_dtd5nmi	1	*	I don't get anything man, me is dumbo. 
t1_dtd1wm4	1	*	He's become a south park level character a long time ago. Nothing surprises me anymore.

t1_dtd2lz8	0	*	Yknow, fighting the devastating effects that global warming will have on earth.

t1_dtd0k2e	0	*	You know exactly why. 
t1_dteec0q	1	*	With risk that the funding will just be wasted in corruption 
t1_dtd1dgw	0	*	Yeah, but it's still a *record*!  That's got to be good, hasn't it?  /s
t1_dtds1gi	1	*	He was created by the Sirius Cybernetics division 
t1_dtd4tl5	1	*	Signing Paris agreement is a good deal. Everyone knows and this is why every country signed. Each country could set their own goals. There's no way they were going to fuck themselves.
t1_dtd4wxb	1	*	When has he paid attention to something for 30 minutes straight?
t1_dtd2g7t	1	*	He speaks at a 4th grade level. 
t1_dtd0j5h	1	*	Streaming media content online.  Dude couldn't relate if his life depended on it lol
t1_dtd2mv6	1	*	Then it was because God is punishing us for having interracial gay marriage abortions.   Evangelical leaders

t1_dtczkb7	1	*	Seriously watch the new Netflix documentary dirty money.  He makes *t e r r i b l e* deals.
t1_dtczhww	1	*	Doesn't seem that stupid to me by Trump standards. Sure, it's misinformed, but it is at least an internally consistent sentence. He certainly has said more ironic things.
t1_dtd2hcp	0	*	Thats not how presidential elections work in the US...
t1_dtczc2n	1	*	Your given standard given was too high.
t1_dtd5ehx	1	*	Yeah, but Futurama did a whole episode on this stuff that had a small animated PSA in it and people are still being horrible about everything

t1_dtd87hy	1	*	I see that Trump is a fan of the Circle Game.
t1_dtcx9qy	1	*	He's the jockey in the cart. And the horse is out of control so all he can do is hold on until it stops. Or something like that.
t1_dtd7jvy	1	*	Someone's salty
t1_dtczce7	0	*	The whole thing is the moronic part. 
t1_dtegfd3	1	*	Exactly. What if 99.9% of all climate scientists...actually ALL scientists, are wrong! Let's listen to Cousin Bob who films his You Tube Channel in his mom's basement. 
t1_dtdnc0o	1	*	We are just really stupid in our love for profit and religion.. Profit before God of course. 
t1_dtd41yh	1	*	yep

t1_dshxd7w	1	*	Right leaning website? Huh...

t1_dt9366m	0	*	What is your response that women are doing better in school due to female teachers giving them favorable grades over men?
t1_dsjtpws	1	*	No. The U.S. has automatic fiscal transfers via social security, medicare, medicaid, federal unemployment benefits, etc.

t1_dspgjte	1	*	>Donald Trump  >Diplomacy  Pick one
t1_dsp1ijq	1	*	Well, thats some cringy ass shit. We all know they can be shitholes. Thats not really the debate. Its whether its an acceptable tone to hear from the WH or not.  Also, irrelevant.

t1_duig01v	1	*	The FairTax takes care of this problem. If only we could get the representatives to bring it out of committee so that it can be debated on its merits. 
t1_dui8b24	0	*	Yeah, people who earn enough to drive a Mercedes or Audi deserve the same solidarity and empathy as those who are actually struggling.  Your complaint isn't even a clever wedge. Try harder.
t1_duibo8y	1	*	Assuming more taxes makes your country better.
t1_dui8lfv	1	*	This is now a libertarian circlejerk thread.
t1_dui88b6	1	*	Hes not a 16 year old edgy revolutionary anymore. The only way to change a corrupt system is from the inside out 
t1_dui92jb	0	*	Maybe federal income taxes but poor people still pay social security/Medicare/gas/ property/sales tax/tolls so yeah its not like the bottom is getting a free ride.

t1_dt1n5g0	1	*	I suspect we would have the ability to detect the nuclear elements in the water once the attack was launched. I don't know if we could do anything to prevent it, but yeah.

t1_dt0o6hv	0	*	Perhaps you could explain what I said was wrong?
t1_dt1ti0f	1	*	Yes, its just theoretical, just like the Russian sub. As per the article linked in this post, they are just theorising.

t1_dslc3zv	0	*	>MFW Norway is a socialist utopia and example of liberal policies in play done well but wanting Norwegians makes you racist 
t1_dsm74ts	1	*	IMO it isn't just that Trump called these countries a shit hole. Trump wants white people here and not non-white people here. The issue is racism.
t1_dsljv6g	1	*	No one said it was ok because he's done it before, it's just not shocking because he has done it before. You can not be ok with something and not be shocked by something at the same time.

t1_dslpb68	0	*	That's Karazhan.
t1_dskz2le	0	*	It's not unlikely, considering that Obama spent eight years in office and Trump's been there for about a year now.

t1_du2z5fj	1	*	1. Already forgot about the NSA?  2. The US has done a lot worse to their allies than just hack them during the Olympics. E.g. kidnapping a German citizen and torturing him for 3 months.
t1_du4yibi	1	*	There is no proof for that accusation. Otherwise it would already have been released
t1_du3ewon	1	*	its not even a denial from the country. its a third party saying they aren't sure

t1_du31ydz	1	*	Speak for yourself
t1_du3w96y	1	*	Every country is waging cyber warfare to accumulate intel, as its safe, it doesnt constitue an act of war, and no countries going to bomb the shit out of another country for it.

t1_dtsbq61	0	*	So what's the reason to hang onto this, then?  Seriously asking as few seem to have a legitimate reason why DST is a good thing.
t1_dtrj69h	1	*	Daylight savings, the phenomenon, screws with clocks all year round. At no point in the year are the clocks consistent with all other times during the year. 
t1_dtsbll1	1	*	That would last for about 3 years until store and work hours settle into their old patterns.
t1_dts27ut	0	*	Yeah man! Seriously, I say fuck up timezones more to maxmimize the amount of daylight during the year, switch it 4 times a year! 
t1_dtrnidm	1	*	And it should be European time! U0001f1eaU0001f1fa
t1_dtrsdce	0	*	Im thoroughly surprised someone could say this. Are you not aware that billions, if not trillions are being used worldwide every year to save energy.
t1_dtshq34	1	*	It's really not that hard.   In any case what you're describing is not the main argument for removing DST.

t1_dtrt8yv	1	*	CET For the entire eu :D
t1_dtt3x2h	1	*	Right?!
t1_dtsw7zb	1	*	A problem with this is that in cold months, kids wait in the dark at the school bus stops. 
t1_dtrfcij	1	*	Well, Seattle Washington and many places with low visibility have higher suicide rates.   It has already been proven that not seeing daylight can contribute to depression. 
t1_dv3gcax	0	*	Here is the kicker. The main page claims Russia trolled reddit. From 20 antirussian posts on the main page, I am not sure, what kind of influence Russia has over reddit . Just common sense 
t1_ds7exl2	1	*	Probably intentionally knowing Blair.
t1_ds6j2gc	1	*	The thing is Blair is so toxic anything he supports becomes less popular.   If he wanted to remain he should keep his lying mouth shut or come out in support of brexit.

t1_dtxx07b	0	*	Now why would you assume he's in support of Duterte if you never actually read his comment? If you did read it, it was more critical of Duterte than anything.  You are proof of idiocracy in action 
t1_dtrtarv	1	*	Orwell's 1984 called it double speak. First they take the words, then they take the meaning to the words...

t1_dtpl22g	1	*	Blood Gulch 2.0
t1_dtp1o5t	0	*	I think the limiting reactant here is fighting-age people. If the country gets depopulated of people willing to fight, the faction with the most aggressive foreign support will win by default.
t1_dtp2xb8	0	*	No, it performs more like an A-10 in performance for CAS,but has more versitility and is a fully fledged SEAD aircraft.
t1_dtofuam	1	*	When they zoom in that far to get the jet on video, the slighest movement causes the video to be like this... 
t1_dtoyt4d	1	*	Thats if you consider a government that gasses its own civilians to be legitimate

t1_dtoj4az	0	*	They regularly do low fly-by rocket runs with Su-25, usually out of range/accuracy for the number of AA guns wielded by the rebels. But in this case reports say it was shot down using an MANPAD.
t1_dtp349j	1	*	Oh, I see. I should have thought of the whole heat seekers don't use radar thing.
t1_dtpj2p4	0	*	It almost seems like some groups dont want it to end. I wonder who could profit off of unending wars?
t1_dtp2q9j	1	*	Reminds me of the joke Whats the difference between a terrorist camp and a school? I dont know I just fly the drone

t1_dtojwn3	0	*	oh this isn't whataboutism, i just hate the Russians and want them to get shot down more, just like how i cheer when Ukrainians kill Russians invading their country
t1_dtp2c7d	1	*	You dont know if he was shot out of the air or not. Besides, after all the war crimes that have been committed against the Syrians, Id say anything they did to him is completely justified.

t1_dtnltss	0	*	Why not both? Just like how they should punish both the employers and the illegal aliens in the US.
t1_dt7yxiw	0	*	It's very strange. I'm not the type, but I had to post something on /r/conspiracy to see what they thought about it. Sometimes people who think about these things a lot can come up with some answers. 
t1_dtqrsqn	1	*	Happy? God no. Happ*ier* that an animal wasn't killed for somebody's bit of fun? Yep.  I'd probably trade several more trophy hunters for the animals they will kill in the future.
t1_duhnnf9	1	*	So that we can prove a child already has autism before their wackadoo parents take them for shots. 
t1_dtruzbr	1	*	Trump did not; one of our diplomats did. Then Trump complained about it and said they never should have gotten out. 
t1_dtrm6qe	1	*	But... but... DAE Trump is Hitler??
t1_dsvcq04	1	*	That's cause they aren't in China development wise. The benefits of a resurgent China all go to the Coastal Hans. China is trying to correct it by starting the OBOR

t1_dsd8fzc	0	*	Apart from the statement being a meme, this might actually be a good news. The bitcoin community can move past the mining centralisation in China.  
t1_dsdccoc	0	*	In that case they wouldn't need an orderly exit.   They could just unplug everything today.

t1_dtmko63	1	*	Heavy machinery and aircraft are 20% of France's total exports. Things you're not going to have in your house.   Food/beverages don't make up a very big percentage of the exports
t1_dtn4z8n	1	*	Yes it is, so is the media bias. 
t1_dtmnyup	1	*	Oh noes my French wine! We make way better wine here stateside   . Fuck French wine . 
t1_dtn11pb	1	*	Not to mention Volkswagen emissions scandal. 
t1_dtmi1fl	1	*	To an extent.  As a group many weaker countries can put in standards and face the US on equal terms. Think the EU and standards on American cars.   Which is why you have the very excellent Fiesta
t1_dtmkdan	1	*	so it's not actually their policy just some angered politicians venting their anger?
t1_dtnsdle	1	*	I would believe you, but I would commend their craftiness in not having a new tab open while they do so.

t1_dsz58xj	0	*	The UK as a sovereign state is still allowed to block sites, though. This is the hidden side to the anti-censorship movement, when they condemn national firewalls.

t1_dsg847g	1	*	Because it's better than innocent victims being tortured?
t1_dsfnzmu	1	*	That was more a justification, everybody tried to get a pie slice in the commotion. Even catholic France sided with the protestants just to diminish the power of Spain and Austria.  
t1_dseyb6v	0	*	it's the one that bush invaded iraq under false pretenses and created ISIS after disbanding the iraqi military, then went to kill millions of iraqis with the invasion.
t1_dsg7g19	1	*	Ok, so let them live. They regroup and begin the killing spree yet again. The moral thing to do is not always the right thing to do.

t1_dt1sqn1	0	*	Yeah, most Chinese believe their government is harsh and powerful, but also very efficient.   I mean they promised to improve their pollution problem...and this year pollution was much better.
t1_dt26a4u	1	*	No, but this record drop can't be traced to them. It only happened after Trump was elected. 
t1_dt1ohjl	0	*	I have noticed that any negative US news gets upvoted heavily on Reddit. Any negative EU news gets downvoted heavily. I can definitely see where you're coming from.
t1_dt29k9d	1	*	I don't understand. Trump has only brought some of the ugliness to the surface. This is the only change. It was always there and other people who followed what was happening noticed it long back.

t1_dtp9hcb	1	*	This message brought to you by a turkish terrorist. 
t1_dtort16	1	*	You posted a video of a completely different person.   Unless the rebels decided to play a game of dress up, then you posts a video of a totally different dead fighter.

t1_dtqgz1i	0	*	You're telling me one person dies nearly every week in the US from lightning? I never would have guessed that was so common.

t1_dul6sps	1	*	Damn thanks for the link, he can reason pretty well indeed.
t1_dul8qcg	0	*	Interesting, thanks for the info. I know the US education system is anything to brag about either. I feel like Deterte and Trump would get along but it would affect Trumps image too negatively. 
t1_dul4etl	1	*	Yes. See Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore. 
t1_dukwnb4	1	*	Not at all.

t1_dul8nei	1	*	What is that fundamental rule of statistic everyone keeps repeating? Pls review before you keep reposting this nonsense 
t1_dul7u6j	1	*	Conservative by definition means beholden to those things old and established. Science by definition questions all things established. Add the religious aspect and it's an easy fight to pick

t1_dske6a9	1	*	Uhhhh.. the popular vote lost. I tried.
t1_ds67jmh	0	*	Germans have an excellent track record of integrating thousands to millions of Western and eastern Europeans economic migrants. The problem is not the Germans, it's those that don't want to integrate.
t1_ds64k2i	1	*	Yep, some will never be integrated, it's just unfortunate that at least a percentage of those were because we failed them. But for those that can be, we can only benefit from proper integration.   
t1_ds656n7	0	*	Pointing to individual cases or reporting nationally about every single case to make the problem appear larger has been a common feature as well.
t1_dv0koak	1	*	That's the point of the comment, it was sarcasm.
t1_dv0yklo	1	*	Those who may create problems don't know English don't want to know, can't learn and just don't care about resources on foreign languages.
t1_dv1px4u	1	*	RemindMe! One year I hope /u/Kiboune is still with us. 
t1_dv0ifco	1	*	So basically a school shooter. 
t1_dv0kfhl	1	*	Sweet! Mentioning poverty cures it instantly!

t1_dv222jl	0	*	Lol for what other reason would they develop a missile-defense evading missile?   
t1_dv1nzqh	1	*	You say that like the US isn't a broken failure. 
t1_dv18qwv	1	*	I don't think, as a cruise missile, it would have the the range to go anywhere in  the world (unlimited range as he said) if it was a traditional chemical rocket.

t1_dv13ibo	1	*	Yes, Russia has nukes that randomly hit targets, including Russia itself. That's what's going on.
t1_dv0nowb	1	*	I hope you realise that a terrorist state known as Pakistan has nukes, and has it all pretty much aimed at India and perhaps Iran. More dangerous than North Korea.
t1_dv1m909	0	*	That's so insane lol. I wonder how much the people responsible get paid for that.
t1_dv254oj	1	*	And what is about 1990s?

t1_dv0krj2	1	*	>  there are enough to blow up the world several times over already  No there isn't.
t1_dv0yauk	1	*	Technically, that's true. Nuclear weapons have prevented more deaths than any other technology developed thus far. 
t1_dv0hdib	1	*	bingo
t1_dv0xkgk	0	*	How does a nuclear powered missile even work?
t1_dv3cx6o	0	*	> the russians and the chinese are tyrants  Then why do you rub elbows with them in propaganda subreddits? Don't be a useful idiot to another country's government. 
t1_dv0k416	1	*	Does it matter when it's the only name on the ballot?
t1_dv0lfct	0	*	Is your definition of peace using nuclear weapons to strong-arm lesser developed nations? Because if so, tell me how that boot tastes.
t1_dv1p9pn	1	*	Second verse, same as the first.
t1_dv0y614	1	*	With 600 billion spent a year on the US military, I'm confident we've been building nukes for awhile and that it's classified top secret. Just because the US says we stopped doesn't mean we did.
t1_dv0tsbc	0	*	There's reports that these missiles that Putin is boasting aren't even complete. Maybe Putin is unveiling what they are beginning to accomplish and they are only at the beginning of R&D.
t1_dv0ikev	1	*	You know, all the evidence is probably hidden somewhere in Mar-a-Lago. So when the time comes somebody will have to destroy all of it.
t1_dv0ocy5	0	*	Yeah and we didn't have the iphones before Putin either. Thanks for that, I guess.

t1_dulc7xu	1	*	That's a good observation.

t1_ds2rqad	1	*	They were hoping to find a body. They went there with a purpose. Their reaction to seeing it is genuine excitement that theyd actually found one.

t1_dt6c09v	1	*	*whoosh*
t1_dtm4qd8	0	*	Yeah seeing the same. 18 injuries though. I guess with the density of Shanghai that's understandable. If this was just some uneducated farmer Joe he's never going to see the light of day. 
t1_dsslx1d	1	*	LOL, thanks for that alternate history from RT.  Oh, BTW, before you start demanding proof from me that 2 + 2 = 4, where's the proof that he won the election?

t1_dsdox1i	1	*	Dick Cheney at least had his assets in a blind trust. Although I doubt he was fully divested from Haliburton. 
t1_dsdputn	1	*	Always wondered this. And your answer explains why nothing ever seems to come of it.
t1_dsdocmq	1	*	Truth is they are losing their minds now, they just are to stubborn to admit it because they would be giving up on their team.

t1_dse4w2n	1	*	And Hillary Clinton provided classified economic reports to her hedge fund manager son-in-law when she was at the State Dept.               It is all a mafia, independent of party.

t1_dsdtu10	0	*	Kush, not Trump.
t1_dsdpgeb	1	*	Didn't say that. But when r/worldnews upvotes like crazy and exclaims how insane this presidency is, mixed with the top comment that this isn't surprising. They oughta be reminded.

t1_du46l2s	0	*	Daylight saving time is really standard time considering it's 8 months out of the year.   The only reason clocks change any more is so that the sun will come up an hour later in the winter.

t1_dtyakzv	0	*	So what?  You have shale oil as an option in a trade war or fighting war.  I like that you're selling it cheaply to the rest of the world now, as I'm not American.  But I don't see why you would.

t1_dsvz34m	1	*	If China has an economy as large as this with a 'non-matured economy', imagine just how huge it will be in a few years. The US will be a banana-republic in comparison.
t1_dsxzfzs	1	*	What makes that fair?
t1_dsxw89c	0	*	We know the Saudis funded the 9/11 terrorists, yet we still sold them a record number of weapons. I guess money is more important.

t1_dt7te99	1	*	Bullshit, the private sector has been pretty terrible at inventing new and fundamental breakthroughs since WW2. So if government doesn't do it, likely nobody will.

t1_du9231v	0	*	I have no clue how he's not clearly in violation of the constitution, or why more people are not upset at this. This independently seems like more than enough to impeach.
t1_du8drqo	0	*	Obviously X knows doing Y will cause destruction and chaos, but X gets paid enough to deny its doing Y while doing Y. Or more simply trolls admitting of trolling are not very good at trolling.

t1_dtgjlgs	1	*	Not the same thing, at all. Smoking remains legal. 
t1_dsow3h1	0	*	Mostly that Hillary would win easily so people didn't turn out to vote combined with ridiculous levels of gerrymandering and a broken end antiquated electoral college system.

t1_dsvs186	1	*	There seems to be an attitude that the chances of getting hit by a shark is like getting hit by lightning. It's an irrational fear and you shouldn't worry about it.

t1_duuxzgr	1	*	Could just be saying that the headlines are so outlandish they could be posted in r/nottheonion.  Not that the Trump headlines are unbelievable at this point, but that they would fit in either sub.

t1_dun5fv2	1	*	Upvoted. Important to remember.
t1_dun6h14	1	*	I'd heard (or read?) them say that too, and yet the entire following season were Trump jokes and references. They didn't really stick to their intentions on that one.
t1_dun5jte	1	*	Everyone needs to watch the century of self on YouTube.  All the answers lie therein

t1_dt3wgmg	0	*	Yes, it has improved. It now only resembles the aftermath of a Zeppelin raid from WW 1. 
t1_du6t059	0	*	The Rambo where Rambo single handily killed hundreds of armed personnel.  Wolf warrior 2 is about a Chinese special op in Africa fighting Somalian pirates and mercenaries killing innocent civilians.

t1_ducmypn	1	*	No you must have misunderstood. Homie wasnt being sarcastic. He actually wants those things banned.
t1_duconaa	0	*	I see what you mean but I dont think soda can be worse in terms of caffeine. It would take several sodas in a row to be comparable. Soda has the sugar problem. 
t1_dudsdgy	1	*	For real, cafeine puts me to sleep, I need the B vitamins and the other shit thats in energy drinks to wake me up. Not sarcasm, I'm dead fucking serious.
t1_dud71sf	1	*	You can buy anything up to 3.5% when you're 18, and since that's a thing there's a lot of beer available at that alcohol content. You can get a 3.5% Guinness if you want.

t1_dud843e	0	*	Except coffee tastes good and goes well with milk. Energy drinks are just tolerable at best.
t1_duclqw8	1	*	I'm guessing the caffeine and the sugar
t1_dudbkqb	1	*	combine both with alcohol and you get four loko
t1_due0l2z	1	*	I'm not sure caffeine causes heart problems. The most damning thing I can find is that a person with an already weak heart could suffer a heart attack due to the temporary spike in blood pressure. 
t1_ducwugs	0	*	It dosnt kill healthy kids and people stop being so dramatic. That being said I tell every kid I hangoutwith to watch out for how mad this shit is for us.

t1_dsc2jin	0	*	Now that I think of it in cold head, and read the article, I agree. Sorry .
t1_dsczi1g	1	*	Definitely. Actually, few primary schools do provide English courses. Mine certainly didn't, but my parents sent me to English classes anyway.
t1_dsd3bwv	1	*	Sad thing about Iran is that if it'd been a more moderate and normal state they could easily have a standard of living over .80 HDI by now.
t1_dsdnjdi	1	*	Two hops! Two hops!
t1_dsbt8nd	0	*	> You can still see similar pictures today.  Do you mean rich boys and girls in Iran today freely mix in public (e.g in schools) like [this](http://www.yekfun.com/archives/1838) ?
t1_dschbws	1	*	No, they really wouldn't.
t1_dsdm9ks	1	*	Yeah, that's why Chinese parents pay so much money to tutor their kids in English...
t1_dsd522k	1	*	Montreal used to be a business capital of Canada until those laws came into place. That prompted most wealthier businesses to move their HQ to Toronto. 
t1_dsbvzkg	0	*	Just googled Iran and the same story was in [the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/iran-bans-teaching-english-primary-schools-official-says)

t1_dsoa6de	1	*	Nah Holland can't afford to have ennemies.   But it can sure have non douchebag diplomats

t1_dsyec3z	1	*	Good sense is always appreciated. Thank you for the insight.
t1_dsmtlwb	0	*	I didn't know that. He certainly did not make the best start as new ambassador,  he will probably think twice now before making such false remarks again. 
t1_dsowsnb	1	*	And everybody knows that only we Germans steal your bikes
t1_dsmqp2f	1	*	Yeah, there's a whole bunch of xenophobia, unwarranted narcissism, corruption, and incompetence involved too!
t1_dsnzz7q	0	*	And it's easy for morons to imagine news is fake so they can keep defending ignorant cowards like Trump appointees.
t1_dsn00fc	1	*	>  It makes you wonder how many times Trump claimed fake news when it was actually the truth  Got a second hand on your watch?
t1_dsnq6og	1	*	So shithole!
t1_dsozwx1	1	*	Well our shit is so spread out right now that we might not recover from this Trumping for a generation. 
t1_dtzsnq6	0	*	If you're *planning* to commit a crime, he can report it without breaking his oath. 
t1_dtzxf9h	0	*	Which is currently the case.
t1_dswtn4k	0	*	He can't let anyone threaten to undermine his dictatorship. If anyone else was in power they could return all the state assets he's stolen from the Russian people.

t1_duahut2	0	*	It makes that impression at the first glance. Granted it isnt ghetto but the atmosphere is oppressive 
t1_duaqc5r	1	*	This website is the best thing I've come across all week. I've heard of this guy before, but I never heard about him being Wanksy.  Also, I feel like Banksy would support this dude 100%.

t1_duckyo7	1	*	Considering his competition? Sure. 
t1_du2jcr2	1	*	Why do people post shit they have no idea about with such authority lmao. They're literally for elementary school kids only.  Do you even live in Japan?
t1_du2avp7	1	*	They aren't often used beyond elementary school other than as fashion accessories.
t1_du261rt	1	*	And that certainly isn't a problem in a class-based country like Japan, especially not with their collectivist proud nail society. /s
t1_du2savj	1	*	>short and full figured  'pudgey' is the word they're looking for.
t1_du25ktj	1	*	Id just like to opt out. I would buy the exact same things every time I needed new clothes. But I cant cos fashion is being annoying. 
t1_du2ger9	0	*	Whose 
t1_du263og	0	*	honestly, kids at that age kids can be cunts to each other(without realising it), why would a poor family make their kid go to a school of rich af cunt kids that probably have designer other shit?
t1_du25795	1	*	Any backpack I could hoist at age 7 would've been grossly inadequate by 17.

t1_du6pzbc	0	*	I will spread it *because it can make a difference in some boy's life* just as it can for a girl.  Nobody should have things like that forced upon them. 
t1_du5wbgg	1	*	When we can judge religions with the same morality that we judge everything else without giving them special allowances through fear of offending someone. So never, basically. 
t1_du6l513	1	*	I meant it is illegal and has no cultural root among the public, some minorities still doing it in secret is definitely possible. 
t1_du6anv4	1	*	It's also happens in rural areas of South Islamic regions of Russia.
t1_du64o90	0	*	It has been like this for centuries. Alas, the media would like you to think otherwise. Thus the mass ignorance toward this kind of stuff.  It's pretty sad, really.

t1_dtfadz0	1	*	That's not the point, the point is, the way Europe and the US are trading now, both sides benefit, whereas the way Trump seems to want it, both sides will be losing. 
t1_dthdcq3	1	*	Canadian here. Eh, it's not really looking that way with the NAFTA bits right now.
t1_dtfvfh4	1	*	It will be a fucking disaster and it will somehow be everyone's fault but Trump's.
t1_dtf70tc	1	*	I prefer an arrested development style VO

t1_du3sls9	0	*	 Thank you ! It is most excellent to hear a different perspective.   Thank you.   And I apologize for this incredibly dense and dimwitted man known as donald trump. The World deserves better.
t1_du7jf38	1	*	Even if he fires Mueller, the investigation goes on.
t1_dv09dtu	1	*	Well, if he thinks that then he surely isn't wrong as you are all obviously stupid.
t1_dv06c00	1	*	Well damn, TIL.  I always used hone as in the definition to make something more sharp, accurate, etc.  I guess I see how home would make sense as well. 
t1_dtimdcm	1	*	A lot of people complain to have no problem with Jews, and complain they get too much attention every time they mention antisemetism.
t1_du1yyjx	1	*	He's ass backwards. The bad part is he probably has a I'm a righteous person attitude.
t1_du1rs5p	1	*	Is anyone in this administration *not* a cartoon villain?
t1_du1r4hm	1	*	ThE MaStEr WoUlD NoT ApPrOvE.
t1_du1qk8n	1	*	I can just imagine his laugh. I just have to picture a seal and not paying taxes.

t1_du1ohlb	1	*	[Archived Link Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20010519165033fw_/http://cybertext.net/pence/issues.html)
t1_du1i2jz	0	*	So what you're saying is that Pence should stay home.
t1_du1rf42	0	*	Can't tell if this is serious reply, but hoping it's sarcasm...  Increase in minimum wage has been shown to help the entire economy.  Etc...
t1_du1x8sr	1	*	first openly gay action sports athlete  Does it really matter, when do we start the breaking down each sport and who has been openly gay to win the Bobsled?
t1_du1rzrl	1	*	Actions speak louder than words.  You can't poke my eye out then tell me you don't wish to quarrel. 
t1_du1rzrq	1	*	AIDS/HIV have risen under Pence because he has funnel money away from protection and gutted a needle exchange program. He's literally increased the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
t1_du25oeh	1	*	This is the problem though, he's a heartbeat away from the presidency IRL.
t1_du202gs	1	*	It also helps inform and protect first responders with exposure to HIV on the job... 
t1_du1qs8y	0	*	Not really, i think he needed someone to convince the christian voters to vote for him.  I think pence being a lunatic is only an added bonus.
t1_duhr5ly	1	*	Well I think we both agree that I'm s genius. Also, i don't like you.
t1_du1p0h2	0	*	Agree with you on most things. But he was the governor of Indiana. Indianapolis has a mayor.
t1_du2ar54	0	*	I dont support his politics at all, but making up a story where he says he doesnt support our athletes, when he literally just said he did, is the definition of fake news.
t1_du2vbmq	0	*	Haha go back to She lost- lol 
t1_du1svch	1	*	No, he is a real life villain
t1_du1v6lf	1	*	Correct
t1_du1ma9o	1	*	Good insight.
t1_du1ie40	1	*	Daddy Pence would though.
t1_du1kglb	1	*	Mother Pence will never stand for that. 
t1_du21coz	0	*	I don't think you understand sarcasm.
t1_du1saui	0	*	Is that like when people say ATM machine or PIN number?
t1_du1sqbr	1	*	Same reason America elected Trump: Bigotry.
t1_du1q23g	0	*	That's two levels worse than Brazilian fart porn.
t1_du44l75	0	*	You got a reference for when he said that? Or was it just your fevered imagination?
t1_du1er67	0	*	Diplomacy. Pence got none. He's an embarrassment.
t1_du24b7x	1	*	Not sports just the Olympics. Now I realize that everyone uses the Olympics for politics already and have been for a while but I just think they shouldn't be used that way...that is all.
t1_du1n48t	1	*	That boy aint right
t1_du1h6ls	0	*	Stop reading between the lines, or just the lines, this is Reddit, only read the headline and then comment.  Bonus points if you comment without reading the headline.
t1_du1zqo0	1	*	> You can't tell me what to do, dad, I *WILL* let randos run a train on me at the truck stop!
t1_du22yz7	0	*	Well if you phrase it in such a juvenile way then obviously that won't work. Instead of saying I refuse to meet Pence, I want to meet him and have a vigorous discussion about his views.
t1_du269rw	1	*	You better start making one they get so much money from it U0001f602
t1_du2as2c	0	*	like the forced, pre-written HRC statement about sexual assault while her own husband and campaign chairs were doing it?
t1_du1mf3g	1	*	diplomacy
t1_du2xc24	1	*	Lol figure skating is barely a sport let alone an action sport. It's dancing 
t1_du1zwdu	1	*	I realize that lots of people say this to spite homophobes, but I think it should stop. It shifts the blame to the lgbt community rather than fundamentalists and extreme conservatives. 
t1_du1u0xs	1	*	This should be posted on every identity politics wining fest.  Congrats on being a sane person. 
t1_du1t8g9	1	*	Mandatory gay convention therapy? 
t1_du45lnl	1	*	They'll never understand that either.

t1_du1xnps	1	*	Rule 35  An addendum to Internet Rule #34, which states If there is not porn of it, porn will be made of it.
t1_du1nsz6	0	*	You mean the homophobes turning out to be closeted? Its not a joke it actually does happen a lot.
t1_du1nnjx	0	*	I think people are more concerned with his hypocrisy in using a sporting event as a political protest, while decrying others for doing the same.
t1_du1txke	1	*	He did that to himself. 
t1_du20y60	1	*	Knowing reddit, I sense this poor fellow is going to receive a semi trailer full of yaks...  knowing reddit, highly traumatized yaks, at that...
t1_du1ss6x	1	*	What is he, a fuckin high schooler?
t1_du1z5sa	1	*	Yeah Gus himself has already competed at the Olympics... this is just the first time someone has been open

t1_du1t30e	1	*	...yet
t1_du1fsld	0	*	Australia are Southern Hemisphere hicks too so same difference
t1_du1tw92	1	*	Militaries across time and globe would actually argue differently. homosexuality was practiced as a troop bonding exercise; even if the soldier was 'straight'.
t1_du1r4uy	0	*	And he never once paid for drugs!
t1_du1f45m	0	*	South Korea doesn't recognize even civil unions between same sex partners, but yeah, US is the evil one here. Americans can't bear any conversation that isn't about them.
t1_du1o971	1	*	Iirc some study said homophobic people have higher chance of being gay. My theory is that they take insult in other being gay because others are openly expressing something they repressed.
t1_du1x2mz	1	*	Your top upvoted comment is you quoting someone else... wtf this is the perfect comment with everything we all hate haha
t1_du1rnsz	1	*	What's frightening to me is that if we remove the current horrible excuse of a human being from his throne, this is his replacement. They both need to go, and at this point, I frankly don't care how.
t1_du1o7bm	0	*	[lol, classic stuff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HIlNhuFgb0/hqdefault.jpg) 
t1_du1jy82	0	*	So what you're saying is... it isn't fair that only the gays get the Pence electroshock therapy treatment, the straights should get it too?
t1_du1rccz	1	*	My first thought too, it's almost too ridiculous to believe.
t1_du1ulks	1	*	well, the spartans, even thousands of years later are still known as terrible fighters and we know their stance on homosexuality /s
t1_du1r17e	1	*	Yes
t1_du3ij2s	1	*	Be the change you want to see in the world.

t1_dt9u95x	0	*	And MY bow.
t1_dtalfm2	0	*	Not when it counts
t1_dt9l781	1	*	Eh, I used to have the stuff every day and I stayed skinny as fuck. But then I wasn't eating much food in general throughout the day. It just tastes so good
t1_dt9mnmc	1	*	This seems overly negative. Plenty of people eat it here and most of us all have social lives. 
t1_dt9oipa	1	*	Nutella ain't about the chocolate, it's about the hazelnuts.
t1_dscousw	1	*	Science isn't in the business of proving anything. 
t1_dsdwt4x	1	*	Aboriginal magic, probably. 
t1_dsd055p	1	*	You want to be a lot more careful with corrupt politicians who oppose the advice of science solely because corporations pay them to.
t1_dsc2p65	1	*	There are other ways to reduce stress than vacations and junk food. Stop making assumptions.
t1_dscxuj7	1	*	Are you overweight by any chance?
t1_dscilc6	1	*	Turns out taxing a product does more than push along the supply/demand curve.
t1_dtmfruo	0	*	No it wasn't. 
t1_ds3tekk	0	*	Unfortunately not the pine beetle. We'd need prolonged (say 2 months) of -50 to put any serious dent in their populations.
t1_ds3nc2q	0	*	NorCal is in the high 50s, high 70s/low 80s in SoCal.  I was just out in Pasadena to view the rose floats and was sweating in the sun
t1_ds3g69j	1	*	We're all about freezedom here in 'Merica.
t1_ds3bk5l	0	*	I just got back to NC today after ten days in Wisconsin. I was pleased to finally be above zero. I think the warmest day was high of -2, low of -11.
t1_ds3gx0v	1	*	Damn, I am in Texas and apparently its colder here than there. We flip out when its 32.
t1_ds3waps	1	*	Carolina here too. My pipes froze but just the ones for hot water. What is this?
t1_ds3ujao	1	*	I was wondering if it was raining men? hallelujah, is it raining men?

t1_ds3jnzo	0	*	We took control of the Winter Soldier
t1_ds3i6wd	1	*	It has been pretty cold in Vancouver... by Vancouver standards that is.
t1_dt4n1rx	1	*	We usually try to dance around the fact that this is what we're doing, though. Part of what's surprising me is how blunt they're being about what they're doing. 
t1_dv5fm00	1	*	>  If you are looking for logic, you are looking in the wrong place.  QFT. If the US electorate were able to use logic we wouldn't be in this mess.
t1_dv5juk3	0	*	That's a lot of us. Though I was more realistic about it taking more than a clown suit to run a country. I'm feeling better about having generally gotten out of the markets.
t1_dv632qo	1	*	Or a leash tug
t1_dv52rv3	1	*	Well its either that or *pay a fine* for NOT having health insurance 
t1_dv5nh19	0	*	Ford and Jeep seem to have no problem selling in Europe.  EDIT Tesla too sells like hotcakes nowadays.
t1_dv5t1hi	1	*	He realizes he's getting away with anything he could possibly say at this point
t1_dv537qc	0	*	While a lot of US cars don't sell well in Europe, there are some that do. Ford has some rather well selling models, IIRC.
t1_dv5m72e	1	*	It's even more unfair that they don't allow cars that run on coal.
t1_dv6d027	1	*	#Morons Are Governing America
t1_dv61314	1	*	My country is in serious decline, but I'd punch you in your foreign face if you said that to me in person. I'd probably to it even if you had 10 (~.25m) and 50lbs (~22.7kg) on me.
t1_dv5z8yl	1	*	tbf its mainly targeting germany.
t1_dv5ja1v	1	*	Its just the newest dramatic turn he could think of in the reality show hes living in... thats all. He'll get over it and move on to the next half baked idea.
t1_dv4v7mc	1	*	Me  too. Couldn't have come at a better time.

t1_dv5d4g9	1	*	Haha, love the use of /d there U0001f600
t1_dv5ud1h	1	*	We're all in it together.. Except for those of us who enjoy cheap goods made by little hands in poor countries.. Or does this work for the best in the long run? I'm not sure 
t1_dv4yikt	1	*	As the USA being the strongest economy, the demand of American customers for European imports was even stronger than the European demand for US goods.  That's totally not we have nothing to trade.
t1_dv5jjtl	1	*	So, half?
t1_dv4ys9k	1	*	Sanctions. Just like the US sanctions on Russian/Chinese/Iranian companies.
t1_dv6142x	1	*	Leave it to the uneducated and ignorant to elect someone incapable of doing the job....
t1_dv5b78b	0	*	Less than half. The electoral college fucked us again
t1_dv55xms	0	*	No wonder he said trade wars are easy to win.  He didn't know other countries were allowed to fight back.
t1_dv5mie4	1	*	This is a really good analogy. It changes my entire perspective on trade. 
t1_dv5kdxj	1	*	Who knew trade wars were so complicated?
t1_dv5ykde	1	*	The r is for Russian.

t1_dv5it3m	1	*	> colleagues  LMAO 
t1_dv5dbo7	0	*	And Asian cars. I dont know why my fellow Americans have such a hard time understanding that the quality and design of our cars just doesnt have broad appeal overseas.
t1_dshnzqj	0	*	So you're saying you're both sloppy and kinda poor?

t1_dssot1h	0	*	naw, doomsayers are a dime a dozen

t1_dudpxzb	1	*	Right, power.
t1_duckxh5	0	*	Then why are we living through what historians call The Long Peace? Why did that start the moment the USA became the world's sole dominant power? 
t1_duc8e5c	1	*	So what world power would you like to call out America? Russia? China? 
t1_ducdq0m	0	*	Might makes right.

t1_dud8183	0	*	> Yeah, we refuse.  is this an official statement, general mattis? 
t1_ds0twkr	0	*	[Bernie](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn-and-the-starving-children-of-venezuela/article/2626078) was the one who praised Venezuela. Not Trump. 
t1_duacccu	0	*	That x is a click, isn't it? C, x, q in Bantu languages often equals click consonant (Khoisans prefer punctuation).
t1_dt9p013	1	*	Jon Stewart. But, yeah, we do.

t1_du78w4g	1	*	Fantastic summary.
t1_du7bcnp	1	*	This poster has been reading too much propaganda 
t1_du7dp2f	0	*	Since the moment he released the info. Fuck anyone who releases shit that ends up killing people
t1_du73fxy	1	*	Hell, they cant even stop him, they armed with spoons and sticks. 
t1_du809g4	1	*	The top best comment for me is at 31 points while all the following are in the hundreds of points. Can you take a guess at which way that comment sways? 
t1_du6tr5o	1	*	They played us like a damn fiddle!
t1_du7tnn1	1	*	Yeah he started out fine. But then only did for his benefit.

t1_durgro8	1	*	What does being traded on the New York Stock Exchange have to do with it being Norwegian owned or not. (It is BTW).   You seem to have no understanding on how stock exchanges or investing works.

t1_duc3de1	0	*	You are so on a watchlist right now.
t1_dsl1ev2	0	*	China conquered Tibet, many times throughout history.   Israel colonized Palestine and expelled most of the native population and kept a few Arabs around just to show how tolerant they are. 
t1_dsl2cnf	1	*	In that case, you should write your government and tell them to ban their companies from doing business in China. Send us the response when you're done.
t1_dslz57d	1	*	You realize this isn't normal behavior compared to the rest of the world right? Shutting down sites like that?

t1_dsmnxye	1	*	White , no student loan (education isnt that expensive in my country) and gluten is good for my body.
t1_dskmxza	1	*	Their original request was to take out Taiwan entirely and have them register under China. This was a huge discussion!
t1_dskqs2r	1	*	Because it's also exactly what the RoC considers it to be and it's not just listing it under China with a Communist flag
t1_dsl51z4	0	*	'Mistake, oops didn't mean to, my bad'
t1_ds99z9u	1	*	Do you really think Prince Harry had any say in this?

t1_ds95kqy	0	*	On the last point - do public libraries in the UK not have free internet?
t1_ds940gd	0	*	I'm guessing when they say home they mean something akin to section 8 housing.  Not exactly a home so much as a room and some place to bathe and $#!%.
t1_ds9sbyt	1	*	I was technically homeless in UK and back then (3 years ago) my shitty waitressing job didn't require a permanent address of proof of address. Neither did the bank when I opened a bank account.
t1_ds93u2j	1	*	How does pointing out the simple fact that this whole thing **is not** Harry's idea make one a monarchist?  Not everything needs to be so black and white bud.

t1_dv29k1o	1	*	Can you go down low! All the way to the floor! 
t1_dsd9qrw	0	*	Egypt has a blockade because Hamas is a terrorist organization that has been a problem for Egypt along with us (Israel). And they only use tunnels to smuggle in weapons and rockets from Iran.
t1_dsdvw0c	0	*	Strategically aligning with the Palestinians and Hamas (who want to to kill them) over Israel (who want to trade with them) makes no sense.
t1_dsdqnf2	0	*	Maybe we should be more mad at the apartheid state than it's friends? 
t1_dseigxd	1	*	Being annoyed about what has happened in the past is why this situation continues. Be annoyed at what is happening now. 
t1_dse2r7c	1	*	You can be bothered by both, but Israel is the one occupying and making their life miserable primarily!
t1_dsdzom3	1	*	Aid? Food, water, and medicine is trucked in every single day by Israel. Only weapons and luxury items get smuggled in.

t1_du9540v	0	*	It's bleaching due to global ocean temperatures. That's what's causing the global event that we are in the middle of. There's an extremely small amount that Thailand can do about this directly.

t1_dsgzn5l	1	*	> melting due to local stress and coming up.  Earth is bleeding
t1_dsh32do	0	*	So if mantle melts under pressure. Then more weight from the water should cause more pressure thus more earthquakes in the future as the mantle melts and wants to escape?

t1_du1xeev	0	*	You can't buy meaning in life, and it can't be given to you either.  You have to make it yourself by taking responsibilities.
t1_du2c3jr	1	*	That's because they won't see any of this ROI.

t1_du30kf4	1	*	That is my understanding as well. But SSRIs also create dependency on the drugs.
t1_duqyox9	1	*	Thats not quite how I was looking at it 
t1_du1yoep	0	*	Yes, it's nuanced, so what you're saying is that they're paying the first $1 that gets the first $5 extra productivity, not paying twice that to get only $7.50.

t1_dutepky	1	*	So did the Bushes they were both just bag men for big oil...  
t1_duudun2	1	*	The US should have invaded SA after 9/11 instead of Iraq. I imagine we'd all be living in a much safer world without the Saudi's spreading Wahhabism.
t1_dt0stnq	1	*	I was pretty sure he has no reason to want to throw that rule out, but I had forgotten about the last part.

t1_dut3k48	1	*	A sign that China has a vibrant democracy.

t1_dutvcyb	1	*	Yea, this wasn't step 1, but it is another step along the way.  And the comparision is just to say that these things still happen right now.  It could happen here.

t1_dutvdvu	1	*	Taipei is lovely.   How do you feel relations could be impacted especially since Xi is probably the most keen of anyone since Mao to reunite?
t1_dut92ip	1	*	Well, I suppose death is an imposed term limit... eventually.
t1_duss8nn	0	*	The youth are still a significant part of the public. If a significant part of the public is unhappy with these changes, then it's not an irrelevant way at looking at things.

t1_dut5aio	0	*	Your definition of either socialism or fascism is mistaken. Fundamentally, they're incompatible with each other as fascism is entirely against marxist-leninist ideals.
t1_dute8yq	1	*	China never had democracy tho...

t1_dusta6e	0	*	I doubt he would follow the Constitution if he decided he wanted to be king of the USA.
t1_dut39oj	1	*	It's also useful to remember that the CCP deliberately instituted these term limits (in part) because they were worried about this very situation arising.
t1_dusys4u	1	*	I feel confident he won't be able to amend the constitution in his favor. Not enough approval from the states.   Although I'm sure he'll try. 
t1_dusrbhk	0	*	I AM the **people**

t1_dusru6d	1	*	But Xi wants to make it look better
t1_dut4kqr	1	*	India is heading this direction 
t1_dut1522	1	*	I mean it is a one party dictatorship full of corruption. Not too far out of the realm of possibility for them to not have term limits. 
t1_dutjek7	0	*	You probably do, they probably just dont feel the need to identify themselves in every comment 
t1_dusx69o	1	*	US foreign policy has created more dictatorships than democracies. It is pretty well known observation for people who study geopolitics.
t1_dutdr1j	1	*	Looks like Shenzhen, China, Jamaica or Peru?
t1_dut6wii	1	*	One person says it and apparently is therefore representative of the left! 
t1_duttv60	0	*	= =sorry but what's the original text of the proverb...
t1_duu43sp	1	*	> emigration  i just read that they banned this word on weibo
t1_dutegyc	0	*	As is most of this thread. It's like community college political science professors are all over this thread.
t1_duszitf	1	*	It was never your role. US stepping back is the check and balance.
t1_dustv7e	1	*	Whether you like it or not! U0001f917 /s
t1_dut3eui	1	*	Well they weren't a democracy before this, they were an oligarchy. 
t1_duszi5d	1	*	The USSR ended because it was socially and economically stagnant for *20 years.*  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation  The reforms and liberalization came *too late.*
t1_duv71go	0	*	$100 America will put give him a second term.
t1_dut591f	1	*	Fun fact.  There about three times more ethnic Mongolians in China as in Mongolia.
t1_dusqwy6	1	*	This is some low quality bait
t1_dutjwcf	1	*	I wish Indians were rare .. God we are so many. Sorry.
t1_dutgt74	1	*	That'd be as absurd as some colony defeating the most powerful empire in the world, right? 
t1_dut6ii2	1	*	Do you honestly feel funny having posted that?
t1_dut2nca	1	*	Saying the US is the check and balance of world leadership pushes us back into the world police role. As an American, no thank you.
t1_dun4j8q	0	*	How intense? >_>
t1_dt0uchk	1	*	> hare coursing with sighthounds  Me too, til.  
t1_dsxs203	0	*	Public would only relate to government buildings and what not wouldn't it? Even if they could get into the airport the plane itself would be privately owned by the company.
t1_dtys7fr	0	*	But you expend an equal amount of energy raising the weight to the top.  So it's it a different type of battery?    
t1_dv35844	1	*	That's a strawman of considerable size. Let me guess: you've never even met a nun.
t1_dv6qye0	1	*	Lool, mate they are !!
t1_dv357q3	1	*	Existentialism is not a good philosophy to follow.
t1_dv36d0f	1	*	edge god confirmed
t1_dv2cacm	0	*	I linked the interview, I watched it, and yes, she didn't say that refugees caused no-go zones (which you would've seen if you'd read my comment) but that there **are** some. 
t1_dv1ckju	1	*	yeah, europe...where you get arrested, can't say words starting with N, have death penalty, nsa spies on people....too bad america doesn't have things like nsa, death penalty, corruption and so on.
t1_du9s2kl	1	*	I don't think they do.
t1_dsphd3a	0	*	For now...but who's to say that one day, it won't develop a will of its own?

t1_dskfzve	1	*	no, i don't participate in that shit
t1_dsk7b8l	1	*	Hands down the worst excuse going, that's before you even consider the fact it had nothing to do with Obama.   It's a shame i was looking forward to a trip to London to tell that man to fuck off. 
t1_dsk5sae	1	*	She was dead for three years when he said it
t1_dskbx1i	0	*	But.. but Britain might not like Trump! REEEEEE  Feelings > order, stability, wealth, etc.   Duh.
t1_dsjzhuu	0	*	According to even more millions of us, those 58 million aren't welcome here either. This country is a fucking mess.
t1_dsk92vt	1	*	He's not the first NFL owner to become an ambassador.
t1_dskaswx	1	*	That's not quite true. He's welcome in different regions, depending on the rate of incest per capita, or course. 
t1_dskbmn2	0	*	Because, sadly, he tweets before he thinks. 
t1_dskd67e	1	*	GW Bush came five times and he was pretty unpopular here.
t1_dskcfjp	1	*	The subway stays packed like a multicultural slave ship.
t1_dsk9wcv	0	*	January in Britain? I hope you enjoy drizzle. 
t1_dsk6rle	1	*	I was sure this was fake. And then I realized I am not that lucky.  Fuck Trump. 
t1_dsk7qjp	1	*	As heir to the Johnson & Johnson line, I'm sure he was just fine at that *private* school.  
t1_dsk6bbw	1	*	I am *so* sick and tired of saying, No, he didn't and being wrong.
t1_dskdu2k	0	*	Hahahahaha Trump apologising XD ooooh man that'll be the day. Thank you for starting my day off with a laugh
t1_dska63m	1	*	Godamn. Only on my second read did I realize you were serious, that this is his actual tweet.
t1_dsk8bzx	1	*	Trump wont be invited, not a chance. Obama wasnt invited to the previous one, though will most likely be invited to this one because of his relationship with Harry. 
t1_dsl05a0	1	*	Are you alerting us to your 'mangina'? There are places where you can seek help. Stay strong buddy.
t1_dskw5ev	1	*	Yes, did not like it at all.  There are plenty of shitholes in the USA too so its not a London thing to me.  Just an opinion.
t1_dskjlx6	1	*	Last I saw, he was sitting at around 30%. 
t1_dsk8s6n	0	*	Makes sense, because that comment was pretty dickish.
t1_dsk64x0	0	*	And after that some one debunks the claim that obama sold it cheap. Why would he claim something like that and NOT fact check...
t1_dsk9qvc	0	*	Farage and his c*nt mates.  The person who cashes the cheques at Cambridge Analytica.  Thats it.
t1_dsk7na0	1	*	a la #resistance?
t1_dsk72fd	1	*	Best bit? The news in the UK just mentioned the 'deal' was done by the Bush administration. (Nobody tell him that, we're fine with him not coming!) 
t1_dskce9u	1	*	Not enough to fulfill his desperation for an ego-stroking, though.
t1_dsk5tni	1	*	I was thinking oh your one is good...then I saw the link. Haha what is life
t1_dskfzuo	0	*	Yeh but Mayfair and belgravia are both nicer (and more expensive) areas of London. So in that sense vauxhall isn't the best.
t1_dsk0v0e	1	*	He said it 3 years after she passed away 
t1_dsk5wdu	1	*	It's a classy kind of petty.
t1_dsk7ewg	1	*	That's a pretty good Trump impersona....oh.
t1_dskbm2p	0	*	He fucking sucks
t1_dskai28	1	*	Johnson isn't an innuendo in the UK. Woody kinda is, but not enough to pick on.
t1_dskfz90	0	*	They were going to use lipton.
t1_dskdxrc	1	*	> I didnt believe you; then...  Yeah thats pretty much how it goes with Trump
t1_dsk5s1l	0	*	- says increasingly nervous man
t1_dsl3e2z	1	*	Yes...but is there a Shake Shack?
t1_dsk719f	1	*	Naw, Britain's too white for him to say that.
t1_dsraek1	1	*	Actually he probably can
t1_dskewwo	0	*	This comment basically equates to Im not fussed about getting a terminal disease
t1_dskcjoo	0	*	Well actually Trump just carried on the same plan Obama had been doing.  Also Trump has just blamed Obama for this bad deal with the embassy when it was actually agreed in 2008 under Bush.
t1_dsk5d9i	1	*	Woody bit of a rough go Johnson  
t1_dskeqq2	1	*	Thats funny, I thought he won the election. Seems like his opinions are actually more welcome than yours.
t1_dskbvcm	1	*	Goddammit 
t1_dskdoqn	1	*	So he is the kind of decision maker who puts off even paying attention to the last minute and then has to go with/on whatever is said to him right around the deadline.
t1_dsk7zk8	1	*	And he's gonna have a rough time again now that reddit/Twitter caught wind of his name
t1_dsk6h18	1	*	*Sighs parentally*
t1_dsk380f	1	*	He's an embarrassment to the US... 
t1_dsk7jfv	0	*	Who cares. His supporters will eat it up, and blame Obama for it, while praising him for his superior deal-making skills. 
t1_dskprhn	0	*	How did Ferrero Rocher towers become such a common American cliche for Brits? I've heard this joke multiple times, but I've never actually seen such a tower in America.
t1_dskinnl	1	*	He goes into a room with someone opposite his political views and comes out liking them and sharing a view of theirs. He's simultaneously open-minded and close-minded. 
t1_dsk924u	0	*	The Bush administration wanted it updated and Congress approved.       The Qataris bought the old one and turned it into a hotel. 
t1_dskbl50	1	*	Kind. Nippy. Langur. 
t1_dsk5lg8	1	*	Well, since the the 2016 election Alzheimer's has been pretty great.
t1_dskedjr	1	*	I don't think pussys deserve that kind of an insult, my cat is a wonderful companion
t1_dskhpq9	1	*	[During his presidential campaign there was a parliamentary debate over banning him from the country entirely.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZunCEYtER0)
t1_dsk6c9v	1	*	At least he lives in the U.K. now, where neither of his names are widely used slang terms for penis.
t1_dsk8fy2	1	*	Jesus christ...
t1_dsjy5zf	1	*	^*woosh*
t1_dskagwf	1	*	Where you staying?
t1_dske6gy	1	*	Sounds like the [Recency Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect) on steroids. Maybe he had a tamping rod blown through his brain, that can do weird things.
t1_dskavcm	1	*	Nothing sells for peanuts in London.  Edit: the land actually belonged to the Duke of Edinburgh who refused to sell it but was leased for one gold peppercorn per year. 
t1_dskasd2	1	*	> Vile. Foul. Agonizing.  What qualifications are you suggesting we need for people whose job description is essentially: a) Make people like us more. b) See a)?
t1_dsk5u7p	1	*	Failing royal family. They only dont want me there because Im Harrys real dad.
t1_dskecla	0	*	*pretty good so far*  What... what alternate universe are you from?
t1_dskcqkf	1	*	Seems like he likes Russia and Saudi Arabia though.
t1_dsk93f0	1	*	As a certified Real Estate Guy, Mr. T refuses to go to any country where a bad real estate deal has been made.
t1_dsk76ov	1	*	Holy shit. 
t1_dsk5jl7	1	*	engLAD
t1_dsk6hp3	1	*	Also, sold due to security concerns specifically about the location. So Trump is wrong like 8 million times on one issue.  He can't even get his bullshit excuses straight. 
t1_dskdnh9	1	*	This one is different anyway, because its a private ceremony. Its not going to be televised or anything like the last one. 
t1_dsju1u6	0	*	ewww. Trump was badly used in school. He's been compensating for his  gay feelings ever since.
t1_dskj6ry	1	*	Unless each paragraph said something about Trump, I would doubt that he read it. However, he may have asked someone how much it cost or someone told it to him in a discussion.
t1_dskj3hi	1	*	Is this the art of MAGA???
t1_dskd84r	1	*	But the new one looks like one of his hotels, how can he not like it?
t1_dsk6kpn	1	*	Qatar bought it and is developing a hotel there. He is probably jealous that someone else gets to build a hotel on such prime real estate. 
t1_dslmsgt	1	*	Where did you go, the 1750s?
t1_dskatwg	1	*	I'm sure, that's why he decided to not come here because he won't be popular; he just doesn't care how much people like him.
t1_dskfb37	0	*	I think he covered these...
t1_dskczen	0	*	the last time I had an interaction with a police officer, I was lost while drunk in Portsmouth and he gave me a lift back home.  If this is what a Police state looks like then I want more of it.
t1_dskcaq5	1	*	And as someone else pointed out elsewhere, this isn't even true - [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_London#Future) made that decision.
t1_dskarlo	1	*	He apparently bombarded her with flowers to the point where she thought it was creepy so in a way she did knock him back
t1_dsk6iqg	0	*	Makes you wonder though... it is a coincidence?
t1_dskbl8z	1	*	I'm not even surprised to hear this lol
t1_dslvmnn	1	*	Yeah, but Woody Johnson *likes* it rough.
t1_dskfn67	0	*	That trump has 'fears he isn't welcome'
t1_dsk9hkf	0	*	What a strange comment 
t1_dsk723e	0	*	Come on dude, if you are going to be nasty at least go all the way and include the Polish.
t1_dsk8bi1	1	*	If I was an American boomerang I'd play stick. 
t1_dskddz5	0	*	I'm from the UK... I'm saying that the only thing he's got right is us hating him
t1_dskbeqi	1	*	What a fucking collosal prick. He is the proof that our kind is degrading.
t1_dsk94pg	1	*	His tweets are out of this world
t1_dsjyyak	1	*	Right on Alex.
t1_dskje66	1	*	Does anyone have audio?
t1_dsk6mtm	1	*	Absolutely perfect. Nicely done.   But yeah we know how to show people they're not welcome. He'd be booed beyond belief every single step of the way.   I'm a little disappointed he's wimped out tbh. 
t1_dskfttd	1	*	An Idiot supports Trump, what a surprise?!?!
t1_dskgdhz	1	*	You really have to be an arse if Phil thinks you're an arse
t1_dskfsoc	1	*	He shouldn't but of course he expects to be because he is the mighty Trump and a royal wedding should be about him.
t1_dskknvz	1	*	So the *Bush* administration wanted him to cut the ribbon!   Yeah. Right. Whaaaaat a cunt 
t1_dsl265v	1	*	It will be a big protest. The man used a terror attack to try and attack people who were working to help others instead of sending solidarity and condolences
t1_dskh9hn	0	*	I don't think he is the type of person to actually listen, or be changed by people. He is pretty good at surrounding himself with his hivemind.
t1_dsk9g8d	1	*	The owner of multiple businesses. A multimillionaire with little political experience, is a president- because he's good at getting headlines.
t1_dskk60d	1	*	Could be wors,e could be a Tesco.  Although I really do like their bacon rolls (Am American, shit's cheap, only 2 quid).
t1_dskrbk0	1	*	The USA will never have another election.
t1_ds3ne1j	1	*	Inhofe takes a lot of money from oil lobbyists, I don't think he necessarily believes any of that
t1_ds40rxw	1	*	No thanks, I'm trying to cut my sodium.
t1_ds48pad	0	*	Technically it's anthropogenic climate change, because in addition to a strenghtened warming trend it's also introducing climate disruptions outside of normal parameters that go beyond temperatures.
t1_ds5l3o0	1	*	One doesn't believe in science, one does science. 
t1_ds4urez	1	*	Say it was 100 vs 70 in the summer but -10 vs 0 in winter. You can have both hotter summers and colder winters while average temperatures still rising. 
t1_ds3tlev	0	*	In the 70's, scientific literature used to use the term, inadvertent climate modification, but it's not a very catchy name.
t1_ds4ueek	1	*	> Mushrooms are a great substitute for beef!   I love mushrooms but they are no substitute for prime rib. Not even close.  
t1_ds3gvb2	0	*	I believe they said climate change because your title says global warming. Climate change is the more accurate term
t1_ds4nuy8	1	*	It's raining in beginning of January when we should have a meter of snow if not more. There is literally 0 snow on the ground.
t1_ds42rdh	0	*	We have to have one last feast where we eat all the cows and pigs to extinction.
t1_dtdh9nd	1	*	Good catch. That's reddit etiquette. Piling more B.S. onto the bullshit global warming theory is just being polite and a good citizen.  Can't let the super-grifters win.
t1_ds409um	1	*	Youre probably gonna have to dumb it down for that guy.
t1_ds4cw1e	0	*	well since we have only been able to observe this for such a short period of time, you tell me you know for a fact it hasn't happened in the recent past
t1_ds3v3rh	1	*	If we don't care about the conditions that allow humans to thrive, sure.
t1_ds3p8yd	0	*	Prove it. 
t1_ds4isfy	1	*	lol, that website...
t1_dt5cb6d	0	*	I got to ask, do you get random PM's with links to never give you up?
t1_dt5nj1j	0	*	Everything must go!?
t1_dtc4bft	1	*	On the other hand, if I post some of the context in the article in the reddit comment section, it might help clarify some details that would otherwise be lost by just glancing at the headline.
t1_dthz74y	1	*	I mean we opened ours in Washington state. We just use it as county Fair grounds.
t1_dtozmad	1	*	> How convenient. Ridden of 2 protesters with the same crime  What? The other guy was just some warehouse worker he knew, not an opposition activist. 
t1_dtp5fg7	0	*	flatworms are cold blooded and dont have hearts
t1_dtpw7l9	1	*	Settle down buttercup.
t1_dtozbn4	0	*	True
t1_dtrcz3o	1	*	Your point being? That I am one? Or you decided to share your recent findings of the shills existing?
t1_dtpsjn3	1	*	A country run by mafia? Sounds familiar to China.
t1_dtps5va	1	*	What as opposed to RTs unbiased reporting. 
t1_dtpqg0r	1	*	Putin is scum
t1_dtby1ug	1	*	In the fall the war was always there but we did not go to it anymore.  -Ernest Hemingway  Sadly, people keep showing up.
t1_dtbw4mk	1	*	I only upvoted because I literally did a nervous bock at that headline and then saw your name. 
t1_dtc0ghr	1	*	have you been living under a rock  I doubt he's from Afghanistan so probably not.
t1_dtc2dg0	1	*	You're a fuckin idiot
t1_dtc90s6	1	*	Well that's daaaark
t1_dtbtvc0	0	*	You honestly think Afghanistan was stable before the US intervened?.
t1_dtbvf3n	1	*	The rest of the video is brillant too
t1_dtcbybf	0	*	I know that. I know alqaida and taliban etc hate the west. Whats the point of blowing up almost only muslims in their muslim cities? 
t1_dtc06la	1	*	Oh yeah cause everyone in Afghanistan cares when we have a national tragedy. 
t1_dtbv7a6	1	*	Tell that to the war on drugs.  Btw these countries have been at war because of their beliefs *just a little bit* over 100 years,
t1_dtceeve	0	*	Chicago isn't the most violent city in the US. Stop with that dumb misinformation. 
t1_dtbw0i7	1	*	Well it's the No.1 spot on my front page at least, but your point stands.
t1_dtbwnn7	1	*	I would say much of the Middle East has been in some state of internal war for ever
t1_dtc7bnt	0	*	Too many 
t1_dtby0qg	1	*	Holy shit..
t1_dtc5r7n	1	*	Sure is  
t1_dtbv5wp	0	*	This is the correct answer. Trump already said it before. Pakistan is a safe haven for terrorists. They send refugees back as terrorists, support and finance them.
t1_dtckts5	1	*	Make Afghanistan Great Again!
t1_dtc5b83	0	*	r/Pakistan poster.  Makes you think. 
t1_dtbsy1l	0	*	Not really, the idea of hell is suffering for eternity. Even if you have worst life imaginable, It will still end at some point. After which, you'll go to hell for not getting baptised. 
t1_dtc0eql	1	*	The US didn't set a good precedent when Tommy Franks kicked off the war by paying off several factions for support and later the US gave Karzai loads of money to embezzle and bribe supporters with.
t1_dtcast1	0	*	Im asking how does anyone know or how can anyone claim the taliban took responsibility. What did they do? Post to Twitter? 
t1_dtbvte0	0	*	You have a bad argument...0 deaths from refugees since the ban...
t1_dtbzbv9	0	*	It really bugs me how media tries to make all this a points game, of who's leading and which massacre trumped the other one.
t1_dtbtnk1	0	*	Well it is what it is.  
t1_dtc3ab8	1	*	If you didn't want the hurr durr you should probably stay away from Reddit. In fact Reddit should just be called hurr durr 
t1_dtbzd9v	1	*	This is a good point.
t1_dtbwx75	1	*	Let's not forget who trained and armed them.
t1_dtbveap	1	*	Basically the same thing. Terrorists are terrorists and they should all be killed. 
t1_dtby817	1	*	>There isn't a single example in the world of an endless war.  If there was... How would you know?  
t1_dtci8xb	1	*	Yes and no. They're just kids. Seriously, majority of the front page is occupied by 16-22 year olds. Of course it's full of kids living off of mommy and daddy. 
t1_dtbpzgn	0	*	Look at this name 
t1_dtcedfy	1	*	Hot damn, the Onion is almost as nasty as its namesake.
t1_dtc2tuw	1	*	Sucks that countries actively do this to many people because of wars, no one should have to kill others 
t1_dtcjtjl	0	*	I think theres a BIG disconnect in your comparisson of multiple car bombings Vs. 1 death lately at a Nazi march or Turkish bodyguards assaulting American protesters.
t1_dtc7m90	1	*	Straight up man 
t1_dtbu4st	1	*	And a superthread 
t1_dtbw1xa	1	*	Not to get too semantic, but according to the way the Bible lays things out, there are plenty of people in Hell for things virtually innocuous to my and probably most people's minds. Just saying
t1_dtbzzs5	1	*	This isnt a conventional war. Its an ideological and religious war. And until Islam sees themselves as being compatible with other religions, it will never end. 
t1_dtbwtoe	1	*	This is the top thread on Reddit. 
t1_dtbzirx	1	*	The if I told you to jump off a bridge argument. 
t1_dtc66ya	0	*	I can't figure out if you're trolling or just straight prejudice. Have you ever visited an Islamic country? 
t1_dtbsyy1	0	*	You saw M*A*S*H as well I see. 
t1_dtbwy46	0	*	Go 8 hours without a thoroughly cleaned asshole after a wet shit.  Youll find that username is vital to existence.  
t1_dtbx7my	1	*	It's because there's a reason it's called news. If something like this to happen it Europe it would be noteworthy. In Afghanistan (and most Muslim countries) this is almost normal. 
t1_dtbz4fn	1	*	That's why what America is doing in those countries should be very illegal, there is no way to win and every way to lose.
t1_dtc3d06	1	*	Each war ends , true...but the resolution often times cause the next conflict. And let's not forget, the Taliban see this as a religious war....those aren't easily stopped.
t1_dtceaoj	1	*	Considering trump said he wants a terror attack.....
t1_dtcakjj	1	*	They switch who they support as a means of survival. 
t1_dtbuz75	1	*	Would you be more surprised if you woke up to find shit in your toilet or in your microwave?
t1_dtbwm6s	1	*	Secular doesnt mean godless fyi 
t1_dtc4qnl	1	*	Until the next one...  I hope not. But with history as a guide, this shit is going to flare up again and again and again. 
t1_dtbwxig	1	*	This comment is even more retarded than the parent...
t1_dtbwmqe	1	*	Also, who kills ISIS and the Taliban the most there is an existential war for islam in the middle-east.
t1_dtc13eq	1	*	You think there are still lions fighting over basically the same chunk of the Serengeti for the last 4 million years?
t1_dtc2clt	1	*	I always feel this way when there's news of an attack that killed hundreds and my national news just says 2 CANADIANS KILLED IN ATTACK...and some other jabronis.
t1_dtbuxod	1	*	We have been since the First World War
t1_dtbxq93	0	*	This can't possibly be real.
t1_dtbvbpp	1	*	Think he means they werent the intended targets. Like they give a shit anyway though. Animals.
t1_dtcgp7s	0	*	How?
t1_dtbplv2	0	*	You realize they tack on almost any death to that? Guy dies in a construction accident, tack it on, taliban beheads a gay guy, US fault. 
t1_dtbsrju	1	*	You should read up on Afghan history.
t1_dtbw9g5	1	*	This is front page now tho.
t1_dtbuzqn	0	*	That makes sense.
t1_dtc98k7	1	*	I think the sentiment was They didn't even hit their intended target. Awkwardly worded, but.
t1_dtci1hm	1	*	>All wars eventually end. There isn't a single example in the world of an endless war.   Are we acting like the middle east was EVER stable?  
t1_dtbuqiw	1	*	Ya but its Afghanistan so its not really news. Go over to r/watchpeopledie and youll see what I mean.
t1_dtbz4xh	0	*	want to go live there?
t1_dtc01mx	0	*	Yes, all of them equally. 
t1_dtc9ort	1	*	While satire, this is exactly how most Americans think.
t1_dtc98pv	1	*	Nah, I mean, it's sad that it's not worst this decade or worst in the last five years - just worst this year.  And it's January.  So much violence :(

t1_dtpkns7	1	*	What would I remember the i8 for? It's a minimum-range plug-in hybrid. It's not an EV. It's not even an EREV. A 2nd gen Fusion Energi is closer to gas-free than an i8.

t1_dtyzb9r	1	*	Only thing I use now is Snap Chat on a casual basis, and that's more of a messenger service than social media platform. Social media is crap, there's better shit to do with your time.

t1_dtyuk2c	0	*	Repercussions like downvotes?
t1_dtyz2e0	1	*	I always preferred MySpace over fb. The only reason i switched was because everyone else did.
t1_dtz48uw	0	*	You're just making a less funny version of the joke you're responding to
t1_dtyzbze	1	*	what if that was the whole point of facebook? a whole conspiracy revolving around Zucc releasing our own weakness onto ourselves
t1_dtzfpw0	1	*	And ending up with hillary would have put us in any better of a situation? Yeah thats what we call wishful thinking.
t1_dtyy4bo	1	*	It has already started. I was on Facebook to see pictures of my friends' kids. There is almost nothing there that interests me anymore.

t1_dtz7q75	0	*	The article doesn't provide an answer. It says regulations and doesn't specify anything as to what that would entail.
t1_dtzb54r	1	*	True, as an office worker at a large international company, I sometimes wonder how my colleagues manage to feed themselves.  Difficult stuff, handling and managing cutlery. 
t1_dtyztqj	1	*	Except the fact that one if a publicly traded company worth billions
t1_dtzedtj	1	*	1 like = 1 prayer Share this to all your friends
t1_du1kqww	1	*	This is about news articles that pop up on your news feed from Facebook ads, not shared posts from other people. It's in the article.
t1_dtzh4tr	1	*	I agree its more entertaining. Also, there are some great subreddits to help you. But as far as smarter, barely. But thats my opinion. 
t1_dtz1zjf	0	*	Trudeau tweeted out the fake news about the hijab scissor girl and never retracted it.  Literally spreading fake news.

t1_dtzh299	1	*	At first I thought so but he seems super pretentious, and only acted open minded to get the younger vote
t1_dtz00zn	1	*	Algorithms let the racist bullshit reach the people who will be most convinced by racist bullshit. Facebook needs to stop spreading poison to those thirsty for it.
t1_dtzdu44	1	*	I would have deleted mine years ago, but I have family and friends around the globe that I use it to remain in contact with
t1_dtz6m8b	1	*	How do you permanently delete your account? Ive tried but all I can do is just deactivate it.
t1_dtza8pk	1	*	Im sure its just due to it becoming more popular. 
t1_dtzlzlb	1	*	Maybe im just a heartless prick who could care less about baby photos and vacation pics.  Lol
t1_dtyxf23	1	*	And what about reddit?
t1_dtz3zki	1	*	A lot of people I know keep it for business opportunities.  But there's LinkedIn for that.  I will say the groups is the main thing keeping me on it.
t1_du0cta8	1	*	You obviously didn't read the entire thing.
t1_dtz3o8y	1	*	Got rid of it last November. Ive been so much more at peace since. 
t1_dtzewo9	0	*	Are you joking? Any comment that suggests reddit is full of fat/ugly/stupid/lonely people instantly gets +1 million votes.
t1_dtz15of	1	*	Meetup is great for events.
t1_dtz2772	1	*	I just need a platform for chat + events. That's it. Bring back MSN messenger with an event creator/calendar and I'm set. 
t1_dtz0rie	1	*	For how long, you idiot?
t1_dtyykt8	1	*	Don't assume it has a face.
t1_dtzt5yl	1	*	The wording was your fake news problem. Accurate wording would have been your part in the fake news problem.
t1_du170o2	1	*	No more parties :(
t1_dtyssq6	0	*	About this? A prime minister, especially of a country as relatively minor as as Canada (which has a gdp 10x smaller than the US)? In the days of $3/month VPNs? Yeah, he can't do shit. 
t1_dtzfs8q	0	*	How would facebook decide what is real news and what is foney bolony news? Who judges that decision making process?   Answer: whoever is in power, and whatever agenda they want to push.
t1_dtz2ayk	1	*	Just quit today. Feels good.
t1_dtzoghr	1	*	At least on reddit a lot of bs gets downvoted, or at least corrections end up being top comment. On Facebook shit just spreads like Nutella on a warm slice of toast. 
t1_du0fcrx	1	*	I'm sure excluding you and the others in this thread. 
t1_dtzeoq1	1	*	Opinions are mainly created through stupidity.
t1_dtz0dg0	1	*	Yeah. Neoliberals. 
t1_dtzbve0	1	*	Working HR in a state government office *really* exposes you to the lowest common denominator and its scary how dumb people can be and yet retain their position. 
t1_dtzecer	1	*	Like 4 critical thinking? Or 5?
t1_dtz0qns	1	*	/s seems like it might be a bit redundant here
t1_dtz44zf	1	*	And pay you 10 million dollars
t1_dtywt06	1	*	It's algorithms that make that bullshit go viral though.
t1_dtyypxz	1	*	Seriously? Calling for Trump to be shot happens about 7 million times a day on FB. 
t1_dtz0mli	1	*	The situation now seems better than in quite some time. Im not sure what situation you are referring to. 
t1_dtyv9mk	0	*	Happy cake day. U0001f370
t1_dtyz546	1	*	Thats not the responsibility of the government to plop down. Civic duty exists, and the government does recognize it.
t1_dtzda6c	1	*	I guess I just have a higher opinion of some of them because offline they are cool folks that I enjoy hanging out with. 
t1_dtz3a28	1	*	Sourrey
t1_dtyyjsg	0	*	I only use facebook to post articles critical of facebook & zuckerberg now. 
t1_dtz91xn	1	*	Considering people are replacing Facebook with stuff like Instagram, which Facebook owns... Facebook still wins. Buying Instagram and WhatsApp were their best moves so far.

t1_dttd563	1	*	And retry him for crimes against humanity.
t1_du6m8o9	0	*	$300 fine sounds about right. Why would it be life in prison?  *nerve
t1_dtq2xz0	0	*	The market creates/exposes problems and then the market fixes them. That is how the market works. These issues would have arose without a free market but would have be harder to solve. 
t1_dtpxqgy	0	*	The aerospace industry consumes a lot of fuel too. Harder to go electric with planes
t1_dtq4lhp	1	*	Once EV share hits 20 percent gas stations start closing. That will accelerate adoption even faster

t1_du7516e	1	*	So is ours, you can see how bad it is when they get put in a position of power. Just be glad they don't have Nukes yet.

t1_dur4a19	1	*	Polonium tea.
t1_duqfyoi	1	*	Yes, but very few people have been convicted of treason in the US in modern times. Nobody since World War 2. The US does execute spies, though long prison terms are more common.
t1_dur0otb	1	*	You'd probably have to make the coffee by filtering it through the Constitution.  And it would have to be premeditated for the conspiracy charge.
t1_durqqd7	1	*	The crazy thing is he did become Pres without that support
t1_duqpysg	1	*	One does not necessarily follow the other.
t1_duqllyw	1	*	Well why dont you marry an ice-cream sandwich?!

t1_duqnlvt	1	*	Apparently worse than Starbucks, if you can believe that.
t1_duqo903	1	*	That's why Mueller is working with the NY AG, who can charge people for state crimes that can't be pardoned by the president.
t1_duqrj4y	1	*	Sling insults at me and state thing that arent true. Like a true Trumpet.
t1_duqcdqv	1	*	They were doing bank fraud while they were working for the campaign.
t1_dur22gj	1	*	Well if you're willing to barbecue the whole high command, I suppose that's worth certain considerations.

t1_duqwuul	0	*	I believe that more serious charges against him have been suspended since he is cooperating. These charges may very well have to do with the election.

t1_duqo9sx	1	*	Its all under the umbrella of Stupid Watergate.
t1_duqoh9v	1	*	Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't. But Mueller is draining the swamp. Manafort is the target right now. Fuck Trump. One swampy snake at a time... 
t1_duqb4ms	0	*	That's when the crimes *started*. He was indicted for charges of crimes as recent as a month ago

t1_duql06a	1	*	I think this whole thing is a democrat conspiracy to bring down Trump. This Gates-gate-gate needs to be investigated by a neutral party!

t1_duqs64u	1	*	We dont.
t1_duqra7x	1	*	Why is the DoJ, led by Jeff Sessions, not prosecuting either for these alleged and definitely not imaginary crimes? I can say for my part, I will certainly post articles when he does.

t1_duqlgse	1	*	I've seen people use DNC/FBI/ObamaAdministration/DeepState as a single term unironically. If anyone, anywhere, speaks out against their Leader, they're just added to the bigly list of conspirators.

t1_dt0p3l2	1	*	Yes they suck.....you know they really suck if the Washington Times is shining a light on them, it's not really a source I would use to check the date if I wanted the correct one.

t1_dsu8s80	0	*	Response: No. 
t1_dsz5bnu	1	*	Exactly, but you can easily launder a few tenths/hundreds of thousands and get away with it while the traditional work force has to pay taxes upfront.
t1_dsuiepa	0	*	Agenda? Even if that was an agenda, do you really support your bank account being drained by EA for ever less content year after year?
t1_dv2dwic	1	*	That would all be disturbing if she had won. But since she didnt, people are discussing the scandals of the guy who did.
t1_dv2rifr	1	*	I suspect a lot of the people in power honestly believe that more guns make people safe.

t1_dv2i2dt	0	*	When the AWB passed in 1994, the Dems lost control over both houses of Congress over it.  Seems the little people back home like their guns.  
t1_dv2e1tn	0	*	Like what they did in Ukraine? That makes sense. Thank you.
t1_dv2g6mw	1	*	It means that the people with the largest pool of money have the most impactful communication. How can you argue that this practice is democratic?

t1_dv2b9xy	0	*	Uh you mean republican party? I think? You may want to work on what youre saying, its not 100% clear who you are talking about 
t1_dv3ep03	1	*	That's my mom, she changed to a Republican years ago because the Dems are pro-choice and she's just now realizing how wrong she was.
t1_dv2v1tu	1	*	Its shocking how any criticisms of the Russians did it Narrative are lumped in as Trump supporters. Absolutely shocking and frightening. 
t1_dv2j631	1	*	FYI you can spend money to influence elections without making campaign donations. That should be pretty obvious at this point I would think...
t1_dv2j8tz	1	*	And that's definitely not what Trump's doing by annihilating everything Obama so much as sneezed on OMEGALUL

t1_dv2ctsi	1	*	Yep.
t1_dv2ovv8	1	*	The awfulness required isn't gonna be Trump though. It's gonna be a massive death toll, into the millions. 
t1_dv2gu3l	1	*	I completely agree with everything you've said, and it's good to know that at least some Americans aren't falling for it.

t1_dv2g5dk	1	*	It's not think. It's evidence. 
t1_dv2lsw2	1	*	Reagan is a fucking shitbird. His administration is largely why we're here. The corporate people realized they could just stampede the government because him and his cronies would let it happen.

t1_dujjeh7	1	*	We're all susceptible to biases but not everyone has the interest or capacity to negate them.  That's Republicans.  They only use self-criticism for Republicans that aren't them enough.

t1_dulcbv6	1	*	I'm guessing you are unemployed, or still in education. 
t1_dujii85	0	*	Not really, the decision is ultimately up to Congress so even if he is caught, they could just decide to not impeach him /remove him from office.

t1_dujf24k	0	*	The best kind of genius.
t1_dujmiyu	0	*	 That IS incorrect.   An American was indicted for providing the Russians with American identities BECAUSE they're legally NOT allowed to interfere with our politics.
t1_dujk98k	1	*	Well, they're already trying to do that with the infrastructure plans, so you're thinking pretty clearly.
t1_dujpi21	0	*	Is that why trump opposed the investigation and never did anything about the election meddling by the Russians? 
t1_dujl55j	1	*	With a very good brain.
t1_dujlukj	0	*	Wait, so he's saying there was an interference? Doesn't that mean that he basically admitted that he worked with the Russians? Or that they at least were responsible for him being president?

t1_dtjyeuu	1	*	My uncle had to get it done for medical reasons later in life. Tbh I'm glad I got it done when I was young personally. Might be in the reddit minority but that's okay. What consequences though? 
t1_dtiz0ax	0	*	>As a Jew, I don't see any problem.  Thats literally wrong. You managed to make a wrong opinion.

t1_dtiy68t	0	*	Saw it once on facebook.  That and how Chihuahuas are more deadly then pit bulls.  Probably why I only check facebook once a month. 
t1_dto6lat	1	*	Yes, I remember having debates about it on /. more than a decade ago, which swung me from an advocate for circumcision to wanting it outlawed. 
t1_dtismud	0	*	He's calling the circumcised penises regular and foreskin extra.  Actually quite fascinating how upside down his reality is.
t1_dtk47wt	1	*	I wonder how much parents get billed for the circumcision. The usual lines are just sales pitches
t1_dtjly4x	0	*	thats your own issue then.
t1_dtkz0uh	0	*	There's still a risk of it being botched. It's success bias to ignore the ones that went wrong because it didn't happen in your anecdotal experience.
t1_dtjrhz6	1	*	You're talking about the tattoo, right? 
t1_dtj5nk7	0	*	I've been seeing this debate on reddit for years and I've *never* seen anyone make that argument.
t1_dtj6qf6	0	*	Lotsof places are still filled with people who hate other people for being Jewish, because humans cant get over this shit already.

t1_dtogicb	0	*	Thank you for coming forward. I am as well. I am curious to hear from another, what objections do you have about the procedure?
t1_dtl7764	0	*	It's common knowledge on Reddit that people tend to look down upon people who are cut.  This comment thread and posts previously about this topic are both evidence of this.  
t1_dtj5cdb	1	*	There is a medical reason which pro-cut folks always mention. Also some people really feel awkward about being different. At least then it was their decision. 
t1_dtjnjv9	1	*	I grew up around Battle Creek. He was a 7th Day Adventist.
t1_dtjkssv	1	*	Too right
t1_dtjdro4	1	*	Exactly what I was looking for in this thread. Cheers.

t1_dtjb7sd	0	*	Try dating an American girl. Chances are, they'll think its a bit exciting cause they haven't seen one like yours! :D
t1_dtjogzy	1	*	What you have to understand about Americans is that we're a very sensitive people. If some chooses a different path than us we take it as a personal insult.
t1_dtjmzva	1	*	If you say they have nothing to feel bad about, you're saying it's not a bad thing to do.

t1_dtjpmg3	1	*	This was true.  Luckily things are changing. In 2016 there was a 37% drop in circumscisions.  I imagine the number continues to steadily grow each year. 
t1_dtkh4zw	1	*	I did see a doctor. He said it may have been a botched circumcision.
t1_dtjs5t4	0	*	That's because they're trying to fudge the data.
t1_dtjpqk7	1	*	They won't which is why people in favour of circumcision are opposed to this idea.
t1_dtj6yyt	0	*	Except one is not remotely comparable to the other in severity?
t1_dtj6xsa	0	*	Absolutely. Good thing though is that people are learning and circumscision rates have dropped by 37% in 2016. It is a growing and healthy trend. 
t1_dtk8mqp	1	*	it was performed to prevent infection, was very successful, and became religiously practiced. In todays age, the mutilation of an infants genitals is insane 
t1_dtjhz7f	1	*	I read the article again and see that they didn't mention any positive health benefits for less bacteria so I guess there is an argument
t1_dtjr95s	1	*	I'm atheist and kinda decided I would leave it up to my wife who is also atheist. She said all of ours sons would be circumcised and was shocked I even asked the question.
t1_dtjivrk	1	*	Because they're Danish
t1_dtjujm4	0	*	> it's encouraged in the US because girls think it looks nicer      Most would say they dont care though. No idea why you would generalize opinions like that.
t1_dtjgc7u	1	*	If I cut off your arm I'm reducing the odds of you getting a broken arm by 50%. That's basically what the reduction in infections is on an exaggerated example.
t1_dtju51j	1	*	To say circumcision is a practice of religious self-survival is wrong.  The Jewish faith doesn't proselytize.
t1_dtj1rla	0	*	I literally never see it at all, all I see is people complaining about people saying it after misinterpreting arguments that it's wrong to *do* the procedure to babies. 
t1_dtjhi3u	1	*	Amen. Sorry about your eye.
t1_dtjloqn	1	*	I love it when people spread the word about this sub and the company behind it.  Edit: Post above me was deleted so I'll edit it into my comment. The user above me was linking to /r/Foregen
t1_dtj8lvf	0	*	He also invented cornflakes because he thought it would make people stop having sex.  His theory was that the bland flavor would discourage flairs of passion.  
t1_dtjmc4y	1	*	Not true, mine looks different when erect.
t1_dtjo4wi	1	*	Women prefer cut, from extensive research 
t1_dtizzx1	1	*	Why are there no free flying spaceships for all of us? I'm outraged about it
t1_dtjq21w	1	*	I dont feel bad either.  I just dont need people telling me I should be angry and feel like a victim. 
t1_dtjo44e	1	*	You're overreacting 
t1_dtjpkzv	1	*	Its quite idiotic considering very little amount of countries still do circumscision. If only those idiots will realize that cut dicks are out numbered by natural dicks by a large margin. 
t1_dtjb0s7	0	*	Sorry but I disagree. No one should be allowed to make that decision for someone else. If I could I'd sue the shit out of the doctor who did mine. I didn't consent. It's mutilation plain and simple. 
t1_dtix5gw	1	*	*then
t1_dtj6x0c	1	*	that's what it is now. but it didn't start out that way in the US.
t1_dtjitr6	1	*	There has NEVER been a reputable, trustworthy survey of Reddit users. Nobody knows ANYTHING about the demographics of Reddit.
t1_dtjbt62	1	*	It's in a little book I'm sure you've heard of. It's called The Bible  /s
t1_dtkaw67	1	*	Yeah have to admit going at it with a bowl of crispy cornflakes isnt on my bucket list... Forskin or not.
t1_dtjjlgh	1	*	Because they dont know the effects of having a foreskin....how is this completely lost on you? 
t1_dtjk1iq	1	*	Yeah this is my first time seeing a thread like this, it kinda freaked me out until I got to these comments
t1_dtjguhj	1	*	who also thought masturbation was bad
t1_dtjvbq1	1	*	>Because it's a religious practice.  So was the Inquisition.
t1_dtk8a2i	0	*	I mean, some people kill their fetuses because they decide they don't want them, i honestly don't find circumcision to be that bad 
t1_dtje3ky	1	*	I'm just wondering why so many redditors are so obsessed with baby penises.
t1_dtjeqfq	0	*	No ones gonna ever admit (at least the people who get involved in these discussions) that my dick is worse than yours. 
t1_dtjtkzr	1	*	That's not what's being said, but that is what's being heard. People tend to get defensive when people say what's been done to their genitals is mutilation and abuse. That's natural.
t1_dtjlrn3	1	*	Wow. I thought it less than 5%.
t1_dtjr2aq	1	*	My dad was circumcised for non-religious reasons, but I was not. I'm incredibly grateful to him and my mom for breaking that chain.
t1_dtjz1qv	1	*	lol ok then? I never said I agree that it should be done at birth. I simply enjoy my clean penis. Get mad reddit lol
t1_dtjcpwo	1	*	It's disgusting that women hold such opinions.  Intact bodies are so gross  How would they feel about a man commenting on their vagina like that?  
t1_dtjvwgg	0	*	Yeah we're fucked. What's your point?   But I live in a very progressive area (Portland, OR) about 3000km from Texas.
t1_dtjc902	1	*	It's current year there are fewer infections across all metrics. Humans understand basic hygiene now so there shouldn't be too many problems if you don't cut your dick off.
t1_dtkl1yr	1	*	I went to school with a kid who got circumcised at 14.  His choice.
t1_dtiwdap	0	*	My only argument to add to this discussion is that people who are not circumcised have the option to undergo circumcision. The reverse is not true.
t1_dtjkfvt	1	*	I'm agnostic and have had it done to 4 of my boys so far, all as infants.  Nothing to do with religion for me.
t1_dtjok2i	1	*	The general medical consensus is that it doesnt make much of a difference either way.
t1_dtjj38d	1	*	Gonna fan the flames  The only girls that care about the debate are the ones that think uncircumcised looks gross.
t1_dtp9oaf	1	*	American, not western in general. It caught in for a while in Britain, Australia, and canada, but theyve mostly stopped again except Canada. The rest of Europe was unaffected. 
t1_dtjxcbs	1	*	Me too, to the point that I can not get a full erection because there isn't enough skin. 
t1_dtkr8rz	1	*	Nobody is telling you that you should be angry.  The concern is over giving future children the choice over their own body.  For everyone already circumcised nothing can be done.
t1_dtjhw7r	1	*	It's not just cut American men. A lot of American women think a natural penis looks weird, and will also come into these threads.
t1_dtj9ins	1	*	Those are two weird things to be known for. 
t1_dtjhh4v	1	*	Oh look, an idiot who doesn't understand abortion is also parroting bullshit about circumcision. Makes sense really.
t1_dtk7uyj	0	*	Gonna need a good source on that
t1_dui91fz	1	*	I've heard that the ice on a lake in a town nearby (northern Sweden) didn't melt until July during a summer around that time, probably related to that eruption.

t1_dtl0i2x	1	*	I mean a significant number can be anywhere from 1% to 99% based on what the producer wants to convey with the information. There is no way of knowing what percentage that is.
t1_dtb4q9k	0	*	That has nothing to do with our response.  We cant control what they do, only how we react if it gets to be an emergency.

t1_dv0ri59	1	*	Parks Canada is not a profit center. The fees are used for infrastructure upkeep, research, and conservation. For example, Banff National Park rebuilding its Bison population.

t1_dsxyfbu	1	*	Its low viscosity and small molecule size (easier to evaporate + diffuse) has definitely helped it spread further, faster. I saw one headline saying the current spill is about the size of Paris

t1_dsz1tuf	1	*	I'm sure more rapes than that actually occur within a five day period in most Indian cities. However if you read the article, what is abnormal is that the victims were also brutally murdered.

t1_dv0tc4z	0	*	How can you make so much conversation when you don't have a fucking clue what you are talking about?
t1_dv0xcq7	0	*	> what are the consecuences of doing away with insecticides?  Increased pests would mean less yield which would decrease food supply and therefore increase food prices. 
t1_dv0u1zv	0	*	Very damaging to animal and human gut flora.

t1_dv0wusl	1	*	Except of course when it comes to GMOs, which coincidentally eliminate the need to spray the insecticides responsible for killing Bees, and only impacting the pests actually attacking the crop.
t1_dv0q5wh	0	*	Happy Cake Day!
t1_dv0xoaa	1	*	I'm aware the paper I chose isn't perfect, I didn't have long at the time to find something more appropriate but believe me, a lot of entomologists who study this stuff have the same point of view.
t1_dv1093b	1	*	That's not always true. The EU and EU countries have a long history of banning things that are proven safe.
t1_dv0qzxg	1	*	Trump adds one more thing to his to-undo list.
t1_dv0zx3r	1	*	Ah yeah, true, didn't think of that
t1_dv0rpir	0	*	Yes ,maybe used wrong  https://www.google.com/amp/s/articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/10/06/amp/dr-huber-gmo-foods.aspx

t1_dv0x7gt	1	*	I was just trying to lighten the mood, now I'm sad :(
t1_dv0yzgq	0	*	They own Round Up -- largest pesticide manufacturer in the United States.
t1_dv0ubxu	0	*	Been to a few eu countries. Still prefer the US hands down.
t1_dv0q8yg	0	*	Lol what? The eu has banned gmos, encourages the use of diesel vehicles, etc. What are you talking about? Some of the dumbest scientific decisions in the world are found in the eu regulations. 
t1_dv0ozzr	1	*	They will ban these because what the UK is doing in regards to environmental issues is copy & pasting pretty much all of the current EU standards and environmental regulations 
t1_dv0qtsa	1	*	So you're saying British citizens voted to leave because they want their privacy invaded?
t1_dv0qoeg	1	*	Save the rebellion, save the trees.

t1_dv0s5vn	1	*	When there are so few and they become expencive 
t1_dv0rprw	1	*	Funny thing is that many US conservatives will be the first to say the US comes from a Euro-Western background...
t1_dv0sj84	1	*	There are GM crops that produce their own insecticide thanks to the gene from the bacteria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis 
t1_dv1pjkf	1	*	Have you tried killing the poor?
t1_dv0srah	0	*	28 people, one appointed by each elected government in the union, tasked with submitting legislation for approval by the elected parliament and the elected leaders.  Shockingly undemocratic!
t1_dv0ud9f	1	*	Monsanto ones use it as a seed coat a lot. I mean Im sure they wont be giving it away for free but we do use a lot of these chemicals in the US.
t1_dv0tsyi	1	*	Is there any way to get the US into the EU?  We are sorry for the revolution! Our bad!
t1_dv0np2u	1	*	Isn't that the truth. Much much better over the US right now anyway

t1_ds17m21	1	*	The joke is that we lose our wars anyway 
t1_dsuy1lo	1	*	Mossad is the equivalent of CIA in the US, they don't operate inside Israel or the Palestinian Territories.   The forces you're talking about are Shin Bet, and they mostly assist the army forces.

t1_du87fkf	0	*	I don't know in which Germany you live. But since the DB has been privatized we have permanently raising costs and the trains are late 90% of the time.
t1_du8b97z	1	*	convenience=journey time=cost
t1_du8csjq	1	*	Brandenburg and Berlin had this too.
t1_du8mjzv	0	*	If you use it yes. Plenty of people that never do but have to pay for the ticket.
t1_du8ctkm	1	*	Yes, only urban transport.
t1_dua6q1f	1	*	That's another bro of mine, I guess.    His one hour vs 10 min is a bit much but 2:1 is realistic in Hamburg for commuting from suburbia. 
t1_du9z7i5	1	*	Ok, how about the regulation didn't work as per the stated intention. ?  In other words: you are probably correct.
t1_du86v26	1	*	The German state has the controlling stake in DB... and the SNCF in France is wholly state-owned.
t1_du9qet0	0	*	Well if you are somewhat competent you use your freed up lanes to have buses instead.
t1_du8fk52	1	*	Depends on your situation. I can read on the way to work, I don't have to search for a parking spot and its sometimes even faster.
t1_du8phsx	1	*	Insulting like telling someone what they think, then attacking them for it? That kind of insulting, you mean? ;)
t1_du8a33x	1	*	Hell, even as a British student, travel by train alone has cost me ~xa31000 per academic year.
t1_du97duu	0	*	Well Germans bike a lot and then there are Carsharing programs, so I wouldn't say that there is much restriction. 
t1_du9fxen	1	*	I mean we can't complain compared to how it is in Japan, but still, stuff like that almost literally gives me cancer.
t1_dua1jid	1	*	if our transportation was developed here, most people wouldn't mind, but for the majority of people and trips its hard to do it through public transit, even in big cities.
t1_du8daz0	1	*	Grandma you parasite! Immigrants who bring nothing but cheap productive labor we all benefit from! Jerks!
t1_du89jdt	1	*	Lol youve never ridden a bus or a train in your life...
t1_du8e2iz	1	*	Your city is probably already spending tax money to reduce emissions. Spending it on free public transit is like a double whammy. 
t1_du8863x	1	*	Trains (in particular) in Europe tend not to have homeless people masturbating on them. 
t1_du9fhkl	1	*	I dunno... Seems like a bad idea. Even the fucking Soviet Union charged for public transport.
t1_du8kqpu	1	*	Or British. Germany has insanely cheap trains and public transport in comparison. 
t1_dua46ea	1	*	Making everything just more expensive doesn't help. Make PT twice as fast as the car ride, could.
t1_duuzzbw	1	*	I don't believe there is anything meaningfully different betwern someone from Poland and someone from Sudan. Both are just migrants right? I am NOT being disingenuous!!
t1_duv548o	0	*	So if suddenly 19,2% of rapes was reported, that would explain the increase?    Maybe a certain popular movement to get people to speak out actually made a small difference. 
t1_duv3j75	0	*	Yes thats why UKIP are a political party, and Nigel Farage and Katie Hopkins havent been arrested... 
t1_duv3um6	0	*	Please source your studies on Germany
t1_duuz4jw	1	*	Considering rape is the crime that has increased the least when all others have gone up more, yes that is the most likely answer 
t1_dv13q6s	1	*	Well, it definitely is scary, but the multitude of anti-free-speech laws throughout Europe is no longer a shock to me. It's just sad.
t1_dv0wicw	1	*	True. They hop around [free](https://www.thelocal.at/20160707/escaped-kangaroo-evades-police-in-austria) here.

t1_duloris	1	*	Do you really think NK being just poor and weak is the reason they face military intervention? What do you think all those sanctions against them were for?
t1_duldwpp	1	*	Bullshit. The US *government** does not want peace
t1_dulmvgw	1	*	Well hes a time traveller so..
t1_dumb186	0	*	It's different.   And you know exactly *why* it's different. 
t1_dum8smz	1	*	Nah, we are just tired of NK typical approachs. 
t1_dul1jo8	1	*	Clearly neither does Kim Jong Un, not as long as the US is on the peninsula in anycase.
t1_dulmrxy	0	*	Examples of NK being on the right side of ...anything. 
t1_dukybdg	0	*	This suit is black not.
t1_dukozi4	1	*	Idk. I think they might have made the right call here.
t1_dv0fh80	1	*	Fun fact the one child policy did not apply to rual farms most of the time for the fact they needed the kids to help on the farm.  (Or it was to hard to police China is freaking huge)

t1_dsmj3mv	1	*	Given the fact lots of Trump-fans are still crying their eyes out about Clinton, I think it's safe to assume that the answer is a resounding no.

t1_dtysmpg	1	*	Upvoted because Minchin 
t1_dtzaswm	1	*	Asserting that it might work, and that it is scientifically valid, are two different things. Do it alone in your kitchen and there's no fraud. Offer a degree in it, and someone is lying.

t1_dtq6pqp	1	*	The UK has never been as involved with the EU as it could have been. We moan about the problems with half a foot out out the door, instead of getting involved and trying to change and improve the EU. 
t1_dtq8ney	1	*	He already told you why he doesn't want another referendum. There is no need to make up reasons and put them in his mouth.
t1_dtqlgck	1	*	Why hold a second referendum? Just pretend the first never happened and move on.
t1_dtqgw8x	1	*	/s?
t1_dtqfgol	1	*	> It was a vote in a democracy and no amount of redditors throwing the Unbinding word around will change the outcome.  That's just not how it work tho.
t1_dtq7bku	0	*	>that the EU is a failing socialist institution  Completely disregarding, that the EU is mostly a neo liberal institution.
t1_dtqgzwp	0	*	I know there are many, but that's the main one. Wouldn't have been a Brexit if they had secure borders imo.

t1_dtrdzcx	1	*	I think its the same mechanic that makes some people able only to take pleasure in others misery, the success of others feels   like a direct attack on their their ego.  
t1_dtqd5z5	1	*	I can see that x
t1_dtq9ki8	0	*	> Britain doesn't have a democracy.  It's not called representative democracy for nothing...
t1_dtq20su	0	*	That seems ridiculous. Keep voting on an issue until the government gets the results they wanted.

t1_ds4bjls	0	*	So if the leader of China comments tomorrow about having a bigger button than anyone, you think Trump would keep his mouth shut? 
t1_ds4r91y	1	*	Which was, according to Bob Gale (writer of the Back To The Future movies), modeled after the Eighties version of Trump.
t1_ds4bpny	1	*	And very they are cool with underwear modeling, so long as you are Republican.

t1_ds42lku	1	*	Yea... it was just this morning that reports started coming out about Un starting to open up talks with the south and it didn't take 24 hours for the Prez to throw a wrench in that.
t1_ds43urd	1	*	Yeah he actually cares too much but only about childishly unimportant things
t1_ds44dei	1	*	It will be forever lost to history, because when they see all of this, they will convince themselves that they fucked up something because this cant be it.

t1_ds4fcz2	1	*	Far as I can tell about their plans, they're going to have problems with the 'on again' part.
t1_ds47b0w	1	*	So, terrible?
t1_ds4id19	1	*	If you don't why the president should act like a grown adult rather than a shit-posting 13 year old, I don't know what to say.

t1_ds473d2	0	*	What if I show you a picture of someone having their ass wiped?
t1_ds4boq0	0	*	What is also unsettling is to know that if he somehow gets kicked out of office, Mike Pence would be our president. 
t1_ds4271e	1	*	There isn't going to be a nuclear war between US and NKR, especially over Twitter. You don't even know if Kim Jong-un is the actual person behind the account anyways
t1_ds4mlrc	1	*	Wow. It just sunk in that Trump makes W. Bush look like a competent and capable president.

t1_ds4bp00	1	*	Yeah, the US is famously insular and Americans are incredibly uninformed about the rest of the world.

t1_ds3zjmk	0	*	I'm pretty sure MIRVs are still a huge threat to current ABM systems. The US is far from being impenetrable to nuclear weaponry, as is any other nation.

t1_dsbqbad	0	*	As someone who is Belizean, it should be.
t1_dsbd65p	1	*	I was up there last week with the same mind set. Interestingly the tour guides told us the reefs aren't damaged at all, and only 1% are affected from bleeching.

t1_dv1rzdb	1	*	> raises steel prices for a bunch of infrastructure projects for the states.  What..  like building a wall?  So,  do you smell what I smell?
t1_dv1i5so	1	*	Then it makes sence

t1_dv1mb0e	0	*	Where at?  My dad was a skilled trade at WHEMCO in Lima Ohio.  
t1_dv1qsru	0	*	I work in import/export and yeah, it would be 30% at most, and that would be extremely high. Would depend on the kind of desk.
t1_dv1pk7q	1	*	The US imports less than 1% of its steel from China because the Obama administration imposed 500% anti-dumping duties on China in 2016, which are still in effect.
t1_dv1kie8	1	*	It will allow his Russian billionaire overlords to buy it cheap.
t1_dv1rpcr	0	*	Get rid of government regulations, like for example tariffs?

t1_dv1yl7s	0	*	Glad others seem surprised by this. I didn't even know our steel would be a target and frankly thought the US was pretty alright with us. Guess not eh? Sorry bout that 
t1_dv1wc2l	1	*	Ahh yes the effects of foreign dumping. 
t1_dv1z6sk	1	*	Name a business hes ran that hasnt failed. Hes good at failing. 
t1_dv214xm	1	*	Nah, that was just his character on the show.
t1_dv1fojn	0	*	Lol right.  He was just joking
t1_dv1qz0e	1	*	And the implication is that the price of domestic goods will rise to subsidize this reconstituted industry.
t1_dv1xfjq	1	*	You talk about logic yet seem to be lacking it.  Things like this are not announced in advance because companies and people try to game the system. 
t1_dv1di4a	1	*	>Yet. Which was the point of the tax. To allow US industry a chance to grow while providing ~~a cheaper price~~ more relatively competitive price.  FTFY
t1_dv2elau	0	*	So, considering Ozymandias' most important defining attribute is his intellect, not really Ozymandias at all. Maybe he can be an Antimandias.

t1_dv1xp9q	1	*	per cent = per centum, or per hundred.
t1_dv1raid	0	*	It could be worse. Can you say that about Trump? I mean, he manages to make Pence look like a better alternative, that says a lot.
t1_dv1jurw	1	*	Passing on costs to consumers = less cars sold = less workers needed. That's called the law of demand.
t1_dv1gtzp	1	*	> he's just shooting himself in the foot here.  If we can convince him to make it the head, we could be on to something here.

t1_dv1g6g9	1	*	How many of those plants are owned by foreign companies? And do they have blast furnaces, etc or do they just roll out steel from other productions facilties?
t1_dv1vhgh	1	*	Would this cause the US bond market to remain bullish?
t1_dv1p4co	1	*	and legal Weed, bro!!!!!!
t1_dv1plim	1	*	Please vote. Who thinks he gives 2 shits about being reelected? Did you see how shocked he was when he won?
t1_dv1w9ti	1	*	Bush was also at least partially surrounded by career politicians.  Trump's team is famously bereft of that.  (It's also smaller and stupider.)
t1_dv1eivs	0	*	Thank you for this important alert
t1_dv1jpt0	1	*	> That plus automation plus relatively high minimum wages is literally why next to no manufacturing occurs here.   US real manufacturing output is higher now than at any point in human history.  
t1_dv1uuf1	1	*	Fortunately, he never actually follows through on anything so those infrastructure projects will remain pretty drawings on paper until their budgets are inevitably funneled into some rich guys pocket.
t1_dv2u76d	1	*	All over. But mostly in the manufacturing industry.  More detail: http://www.tradepartnership.com/pdf_files/2002jobstudy.pdf

t1_dv1vq4v	1	*	No, I have hope in Lisa Simpson!
t1_dv1nqlx	1	*	Why arent republicans smart enough to say, Hey lets not lose 200K jobs again. Its wrong and our approval ratings are low enough
t1_dv2axm8	1	*	I have $30 in my bank account and my finances are still better than Trump's.
t1_dv1wqlv	1	*	Pueblo?
t1_dv1znjk	1	*	Obama spent his entire Presidency blaming Bush for everything. If it's ok for the Democrats to do....
t1_dv3428m	1	*	 Goddamnit is this orange prick  Going to have us isolated like North Korea or some shit? 
t1_dv254vs	0	*	At a much greater cost and lower quantity?  This will decimate any steel using industry in the US, and raise prices a lot. 
t1_dv1oz4o	1	*	I'd be concerned even if he was the person filling popcorn buckets at the theater.
t1_dv2ik6l	1	*	9/11 though. Might as we have made it 10/10.
t1_dv218u5	1	*	Sad!
t1_dv1sl7d	1	*	200 years from now (if the USA still exists then) GOP will still be blaming Hillary and Obama.
t1_dv1wuc7	1	*	Sadly, I lol'd because this is going to be true.  
t1_dv1snrj	1	*	Bring back child labor! Lazy kids these days...    ^^^^/s
t1_dv1u7o0	1	*	Does he have a chance for reelection? If he gets reelected I have to move to a different country out of principle 
t1_dv6hjuq	1	*	Probably doing what he can to further his outside interests before stepping down after doing One Term.
t1_dv1s9g0	0	*	That doesn't mean we sit back and get shafted on these trade deals
t1_dv1sg47	1	*	And if the current winner of the polls wins the presidency in Mexico, then they're going to get even more retarded. We'll be relying in absurd levels of domestic production!, sure thing.
t1_dv1pdoy	0	*	and history repeats
t1_dv28apa	0	*	Can we start normalizing squatting if this starts happening? 
t1_dv1yngf	0	*	Lol that what I was thinking, but everyone is saying it wont happen. Hence the ..right? Was hoping for an explanation
t1_dv2zle3	0	*	Where in the post did the OP suggest Canada would declare war?
t1_dv353xg	1	*	Electronics built in the US are about to get expensive.
t1_dv1pphu	1	*	Not at all. Its Trump against the world.
t1_dv1q4ba	1	*	These short sighted isolationist tariffs always wind up screwing over the consumer
t1_dv1rahu	1	*	quick! Somebody take his gun before he shoots himself in the foot! We'll worry about due process later
t1_dv2t3h0	1	*	Yes, as most of the other NAFTA countries.
t1_dv1orp9	1	*	Something being more valuable just means you got shitloads more since everyone isn't going to buy as much.
t1_dv1ocvq	0	*	Remind them that they are effectively our subject

t1_dv1ogij	0	*	You broke me
t1_dv28isj	1	*	His re-election campaign song should be Glory Days.
t1_dv1q93y	1	*	he's obviously not currupt yet he's surrounded himself with nothing but currupt individuals..... Wonder why.....
t1_dv1rr45	1	*	What are you talking about? The buddies getting the infrastructure jobs can now out bid everyone because of their steel supply chain & can still price gouge like crazy.  Win/win in his book.
t1_dv1evrg	1	*	.....Lol
t1_dv1wb8k	1	*	They have to get the extra tax money somewhere so that the Koch brothers can take home an extra $26,000,000 each week while middle class Americans get an extra $9.
t1_dv4g3tw	1	*	Im sure they went horribly, as tariffs usually do.
t1_dv1z3fq	1	*	Were not - American electoral college system
t1_dv275k0	1	*	>Why do production costs for manufacturing go up?  Because there are some steels which US companies quite literally can't produce. These steels now got more expensive. 
t1_dv1r29o	1	*	No, *they'll* be sorry.
t1_dv1upi7	1	*	But it also uses an incredible amount more than it produces 
t1_dv1zxcn	1	*	I don't wanna be part of exclusion because that's the core problem but I'm down to come fish and help out U0001f642
t1_dv1w99f	1	*	I use steel body jewelry, this is even going to come all the way down to is, and our profit margins are not high. Fuck. 
t1_dv1p6ag	1	*	trump's presidency in general has been him jamming a gattling gun down his trousers and letting it rip
t1_dv1xlt1	0	*	You already seem far too overqualified to advise the president - do you have a younger sibling?
t1_dv1nxwx	1	*	So this time they'll impose harsher sanctions on Russia?

t1_dv28vee	0	*	There is no steel production in my state LOL
t1_dv1venh	1	*	It also starts Clone Wars
t1_dv2i517	1	*	Trump won. In the sense he won the majority of the electoral college, yet lost the popular vote. Then again, I can't criticise, the UK election system is horrendously broken as well.
t1_dv2ihx0	1	*	Thank you for the edification.

t1_dt61fbh	1	*	You do know Albert Einstein was a dirty red, right? 
t1_dstptt0	0	*	New developments. Theyve taken comfort by  blaming Obama regulations  for this drop and, expect Trump to end the regulations.  This is really entertaining.  
t1_ds9rwh0	1	*	 And perhaps the Lethal Weapon series is an effective police training tool.
t1_dt0ka6y	1	*	Those executed by Isis, or any other terrorist organization, were innocents. Can't really say the same for terrorist organizations members...   Also, it's a safe measure to prevent  they do it again.
t1_dt1rrb7	1	*	This goes for all of criminal justice... but you'll often find, even here in Reddit, that a desire for revenge gets the best humans logical functions.
t1_dt1vmza	0	*	...if a rich woman joined ISIS and was caught by residents of Iraq, I'm not sure how different the outcome would be...
t1_dt222x4	1	*	News to me but hey you seem to be in the know.

t1_dugbmyy	0	*	*sigh*      r/theydidthemonstermath    
t1_dugcmsc	1	*	Yeah but if Trump proposed the *exact same thing* it would still be a shitshow. Even if it was far more generous. That's what the poster above was saying. 
t1_dufxg87	1	*	Jesus was not the founder of Judaism, he was the founder of Christianity.  The founder of Judaism was Abraham.
t1_dug9ldp	0	*	I agree, Israel should take in many hundreds of thousands of refugees from North Africa and Syria and Iraq.

t1_dugbnym	0	*	No why the fuck would they get money for being here illegally?
t1_dufw2lh	1	*	But it was so much worse than you describe. Sometimes, they were  processing so many immigrants that they couldn't provide afternoon tea for everyone in Auschwitz's free-money line. Just dreadful. 
t1_dugb4ft	1	*	Free karma points? Do you pay for your karma points? If so youre getting ripped off buddy.

t1_dug8gl4	1	*	No, but presumably these immigrants/refugees don't all come from the same country. What the hell good does it do to dump them in some arbitrary African country? And why keep it secret anyway?

t1_dugc0wv	1	*	Does Israel have a right all of its land?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement

t1_dszsxz3	0	*	Yeah, it's weird. If you look through their post history, every single comment they've made for months is them defending Israel.  Edit: [Archive](https://archive.fo/WyXZK).

t1_dtzvrqg	0	*	Maybe you should keep better company, I know actual farmers and they treat their animals well.  Are you Vegetarian/vegan by any chance?
t1_dtzq9ey	0	*	Holding them accountable is a great way to start, and eating less or no meat is a helpful way to drive down demand for meat products.

t1_dtznaf9	1	*	If you tell someone you are vegan, they lambast you for that decision and consider you extreme for not wanting to eat meat. This is my experience living in a small town in the South (USA) at least
t1_dtzz6n9	1	*	Or just eat veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds, grains, and beans; then you'll never have to worry about whether your food suffered and was slaughtered, or simply just slaughtered.

t1_dtmvlge	0	*	No this was a cherry picked summary of classified intelligence. You're not getting the whole picture from the Republican Memo. That's why the FBI made a statement regarding it.

t1_dtn5faq	1	*	yes, but it is usually not done in a clandestine way by the country's spy chief, and when it is that is because the spy chief holds all the leverage, not the other country implementing sanctions.
t1_dtniskq	1	*	Rural voter here and I'm extremely offended by your entirely correct statements.

t1_dt93ib6	0	*	Because they leak radiation, there is no solution for waste storage, and that pesky thing called Fukushima,' that is still fucking melting and polluting the Pacific Ocean???
t1_dt8mgw1	1	*	So that would leaves France with bbq as a sole coal usage.  I'm ok with that.

t1_dspsom7	0	*	30 watts storage? that makes 0 sense. if you're talking about a storage capacity don't use a unit which means joules per second.
t1_dsps6zt	1	*	Small aside, but this is what happens with Bitcoin being mined in China. They over-produce electricity, so give deals to people that want to mine Bitcoin. 
t1_dsphnlj	0	*	If you understand blockchain decryption and transaction verification it does
t1_dsppj2x	0	*	I've heard other places using a similar method and they stated its around a 90% of return. If actually true its pretty dang good.

t1_dszdi65	1	*	What school do you go to?  How do they not offer health plans?  I always went to public universities, maybe private ones don't do the same?
t1_dsyw03m	0	*	Misleading and incorrect are very separate.   The title is misleading, but not incorrect. 
t1_dszkne6	0	*	Its called insurance... buy some.  Its not my responsibility to take care of you because you have ass cancer. 
t1_dsz191t	1	*	Yeah this was an instant regret post. On mobile and didn't know how to delete. My bad.
t1_dsz0o94	1	*	So you think you can improve the country by criticizing it constantly on Reddit?  No that's not the way it works.  All that does is annoy people and then they ignore you.
t1_dszex0t	1	*	That doesn't mean the US as a whole doesn't have better healthcare as they don't determine these things based on any one person. 
t1_dsyz4rc	1	*	Yep! And nearly half the population can afford to use them sometimes!
t1_dszbc2t	0	*	It is. Under Australia ;).
t1_dszfruu	1	*	what?  yeah it's an income tax
t1_dsz1icc	0	*	if so many people criticize our country, then maybe there's something wrong with a lot of people  Edit: was being very sarcastic
t1_dsz1mgc	1	*	What the fuck does this have to do with Trump?   Trump supporter being triggered by literally anything and everything? Color me shocked. 
t1_dt0fxh3	1	*	Yes, universally terrible healthcare. 
t1_dsz0cvp	1	*	I see what you did there
t1_dszgyau	1	*	What's the difference if you can't afford it
t1_dt0oxm0	1	*	Keep an eye on those figures now that Egypt has gone for universal health care.
t1_dszpujc	0	*	How are you so stupid? 
t1_dsyx4bb	1	*	Well your not paying $40k for a heart surgery that's for fucking sure
t1_dszi3fq	1	*	Thank you. The first question I had was, Wait didn't they already have universal health care but the infastructure didn't allow for much funding? You answered my question with depth. Thank you. 
t1_dszbgul	1	*	I don't think you understand time if you think long history applies to both Egypt and the United states. 
t1_dsz2c3i	0	*	Abortion is a healthcare issue. That it's being used to promote religion is one reason for why many people have insufficient access to healthcare. And insufficient knowledge about their own biology.
t1_dsyyuhs	1	*	He went to a country that doesn't let poor people have treatment.  Saves time for the important people. 
t1_dsz3sax	1	*	The only thing I have to note is that source puts Yugoslavia on the list. I just think that's interesting!
t1_dszfk5o	1	*	Thank you for the additional insight!
t1_dszfd7v	0	*	Excuses. 
t1_dszcoia	1	*	But what about freedom. Iraq will come and take your freedom away .
t1_dsyz3jg	1	*	There's plenty of room for improvement, this is still really good news for the people in Egypt. 
t1_dszpezd	0	*	You do realize my comment was based in hyperbole as opposed to being literal right?
t1_dszez4u	1	*	Another Egyptian living in Egypt and couldnt agree more. The healthcare system, among many others, is in complete shambles.

t1_dsz69g4	1	*	the US has great healthcare. you are just too poor to afford it.
t1_dsz1d79	0	*	Healthcare on egypt somehow equals anti-trump. Fuck you're stupid. 
t1_dszjfpt	1	*	question: how expensive is healthcare for you?
t1_dszbchn	1	*	Health care and medical care are two very different things. One involves making correct choices with your body, the other is a discipline to treat health problems. 
t1_dsz02gk	1	*	Yes, at the quality level of Egyptian care, your doctor will be a literal camel.
t1_dt0d6wy	0	*	Actually, ya I have. But thats a nice assumption. 
t1_dsze51p	0	*	>This should be mandatory in every country.   So, you support a one world government?
t1_dszb4m3	1	*	It's a subsidy for the American defense industry. It's what allows dumb Americans to complain about 'foreign aid' instead of the people actually getting the money.
t1_dugtp7t	0	*	Maybe like yelling bomb in an airport, but instead of a microwave timeline to chaos its more of on the crockpot timeline?
t1_du8eiqn	0	*	You love pedophilia that much?  Seriously, r/worldnews is ridiculous.  You can literally criticize child rape and still get downvoted.  
t1_duqsyqy	1	*	I was just thinking that. Especially since that reference is from a relatively newer episode and it's still so funny
t1_duq8fi2	1	*	And now we see the Russians using black tar. They use this during extreme situations and this strategy should pay off 
t1_duq38g5	1	*	That's a good one.
t1_duqe39g	1	*	That seems fair enough honestly.  Shame there are *even still* cheating cunts.
t1_duq9x3o	1	*	For what it's worth, the Japanese athlete denies it and only had traces of a diuretic and masking agent.
t1_dur2ajq	1	*	She didn't medal though, she finished 12th.
t1_duqeh5r	1	*	Their permanent ban was overturned and they were allowed to compete. Surprise, surprise they are blood doping again.
t1_dupqbqg	0	*	Yea, those were the days. 
t1_duplq9w	0	*	At this point, do the PEDs get their owmn team?
t1_duq5mtx	1	*	Doping is just a general term for using a banned performance enhancing substance, it doesn't really denote a specific drug.
t1_dus5cer	1	*	Dont allow Russian competitors under any flag. 
t1_dupzx8z	1	*	Like heroin 
t1_duq7pw1	1	*	>It was purely a political move. The IOC knew there'd be repercussions if they outright banned Russia,   Like what?    
t1_dupt2ha	1	*	Nobody think it's only Russia..stop it
t1_dtrb9qd	1	*	Not hard to do in literally any piece of news that doesn't involve the US. It's appalling how strong people are in their convictions on topics that they know literally nothing about.
t1_dtr2jc8	1	*	The irony is that the documents these kids are asking for refer to the 1967 riots when the HKer tried to rise up against British rule.  Spoiler alert: it didn't work
t1_dtqt5gh	1	*	more like a UK slave colony that was a trading doorway into the mainland.

t1_dtqsz26	0	*	The US pointing fingers at money overriding truth is fresh hahaha
t1_dtrpmj8	1	*	>Unfortunately money always seems to override truth.  Wanna hear about the truth of how Britain annexed HK in the first place?
t1_dtramz8	1	*	Yeah... still sexy though. You've got to have a cold heart not to love the TV series Kung Fu. 
t1_dtskyse	1	*	They've already started, they couldn't even pretend to follow their timeframe. Just look at the sham elections with your choice of party approved choices.
t1_dw7mu6o	1	*	No, it's to decide on full integration.
t1_dtr753a	1	*	Can they not come back in the form of ghosts?
t1_dtehw8h	1	*	For Trump supporters (i.e. white Americans), any country of colored people (brown, yellow or black) is automatically a terrorist country. 
t1_dv4603z	0	*	What do you think China feed their people with? A huge portion of their food are imported from US
t1_dv3eitd	0	*	You are both wrong. USA and China can both do massive damage to each other.
t1_dsreet6	1	*	> I'm surprised we don't have people rioting with the way things are right now.  Maybe because it's winter?
t1_dsrurcs	1	*	Voices like that make for great news stories. That's all. Stuff like that happens with every election. 
t1_dsrwngr	1	*	This might be a naive thought... but why dont they just waive those rejoining stipulations. Like who cares?
t1_dsr8p0y	1	*	Spurned lover syndrome.
t1_dsraeo7	1	*	Became a bit more binding once art.50 was invoked though...
t1_dsro9s8	1	*	Theoretically, they could undo it if it had been legally binding. The uK parliament isnt bound by a document a la the US constitution. Pretty much what they say goes
t1_dsrczky	0	*	Brit*in*

t1_dt8t3yv	1	*	Hmmm.. this is an pretty good insight.
t1_dt980hn	0	*	He's pretty much universally despised in Canada, I think.
t1_dt8x1qo	1	*	What freedom? All I see is oil. 
t1_dt91asi	1	*	Fun fact. He's the fucking president of one of those other places with a long tradition of free speech and mocking leaders.  He seems unclear on the traditions of that place, too. 
t1_dt9etb0	1	*	Fuck you next time you need our help ya jerk.
t1_dt8w2o8	1	*	But what if you make special free speech zones where people can protest?  
t1_dt8vctw	1	*	>  greatest democracy in the world  not for some time, actually.
t1_dt9029c	1	*	That's not a relevant response. It doesn't address my comment in any way.
t1_dt8tovt	1	*	Trumpeteer grammar.  Complete utter gibberish.
t1_dt8yaem	1	*	We as sane, logical, members of the human race on the planet earth need a vacation from him. Let's just drop him off in Haiti without his phone. 
t1_dt8vgtl	1	*	They did so when the Chinese president Xi visited Prague and now there are a bunch of no-name news websites lying about the incident in English.
t1_dt8zu40	0	*	What color are the drop bears?
t1_dt9mnsm	1	*	Except there were protests... https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-protests/thousands-march-against-trump-in-swiss-financial-capital-idUSKBN1FC2OI

t1_dt8qfw2	0	*	Oh and leaving drinks is basically a tradition that when someone leaves their job, they invite everyone to the pub to get smashed. Good tradition. 
t1_dt943r6	1	*	Hey dude, carpool?
t1_dt8x6ib	1	*	The hypocrisy is what's funny.  How many sjw's have made fun of people for safe spaces?   If he just practiced what he preached this wouldn't even be a story.
t1_dt8vaj9	1	*	He probably wouldnt have got where he is without them.
t1_dt95azp	1	*	Same here. The introduction by Bercow was phenomenal and Obama is such an excellent statesman. Pure class.
t1_dt916m9	1	*	Oi, we've always hated him down here too but you just had the added insult of his golf course shenanigans.
t1_dt99f61	0	*	He will be greeted by the biggest crowd to ever get any US president ever. Period. Because alternative facts...
t1_dt97a5n	1	*	Because the article says vague things about a phone call. No quotes, no names of anyone who heard it. Nothing in the article supports the title. 
t1_dt8udx0	0	*	I'll come from the North West to.
t1_dt8tu7n	1	*	Eh? What are you on about? What about the UK makes you think we have any problems with free speech?
t1_dt9po7f	1	*	[Of course. What do you use?](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000341329290.jpg?strip=all&w=698)
t1_dt9dfen	1	*	Now?
t1_dt8w0h3	1	*	As an Welshman, I vouch for your statement. Keep well away Donald, for all I care.
t1_dt93uhp	0	*	How is preventing him from being near protests an attempt to undermine the sovereignty and freedom of another country?
t1_dt8v04m	1	*	So basically your point is, Obama knew there was going to be protest and still went there unlike snowflake in chief? 
t1_dt8zpcj	0	*	Source?
t1_dt8unvm	0	*	I think France should claim the statue back at this point.
t1_dt8v9qt	1	*	And to get people out to protest anti-protest rules! 
t1_dt8y8pb	0	*	Gonna go get me a big bag of rice!
t1_dt90ly8	1	*	but if you make a pug do a nazi salute for a joke you're going to court. 
t1_dt912bi	1	*	I think it's even simpler than that..he doesn't understand what free speech is.  
t1_dt8vein	1	*	As a dual citizen I would like to know why you would give a shit about Trump visiting. Is it because of all the lies spread through media without a single source?
t1_dt984ys	1	*	I can just imagine him snorting KFC gravy, he's a fat mess and loves his KFC.
t1_dt9inrc	1	*	Play videogames and watch YouTube videos. Wow. I wish I had that kind of luxury!
t1_dt8zhb5	0	*	Let me guess, youve never visited the UK and you view a lot of Fox news, Daily Mail shit? 
t1_dt8stso	0	*	As an American I've gotta say I'm pissed that this doesn't work here. We keep protesting but he's always golfing - he might not have noticed us yet. 
t1_dt92gj7	1	*	Misread it as Trump bangs Theresa May for Safe Sex  I... I feel like life isn't worth living after imagining such a horror.
t1_dt8so87	1	*	Such insight.  Such edge.
t1_dt8t4y4	1	*	One of his adult handlers got to him and explained the hypocrisy. 
t1_dt9lo3p	0	*	Well he's not my president, so fuck him. Also respect is earned, moron.
t1_dt8t1z4	1	*	I don't know, I think it would be funny as hell to see all the protests if he did visit.
t1_dt8owbz	1	*	Couldn't possibly be that Trump gave a dumb ultimatum and then backed down.
t1_dt8vkgg	1	*	if that's what this is all about, this headline is absolute clickbait garbage. there's nothing there that says ban protests or i wont come.
t1_dt8vcvk	1	*	See - the 80's.
t1_dt8wn5i	1	*	Miller
t1_dt93mfh	1	*	Yeah with NAFTA on the line, we kinda have to behave.. at least a little. Though he doesn't deserve our patience, our small/medium businesses do.
t1_dt8xotw	1	*	But still polite. 
t1_dta5pp2	1	*	No, he didn't want any protests while he would be visiting, he's brought this up before. Fake news had me laughing though, thanks for that.
t1_dt8zghi	1	*	I read water horses XD 
t1_dt8ueqh	0	*	Wait, how do you know the poster isn't from the UK?

t1_dtd3ay0	1	*	It's good that they included an extra hand
t1_dtsmaxp	0	*	Ok, realistically make it thousands of pounds worth of croissants.  They've got an economic life of about 8 hours.  But not banned. 
t1_du7uui9	1	*	Yes, I was hoping this would work on America's so-called president. 
t1_dtwzmwo	1	*	Who are the one's buying the idea of doubting the election results?
t1_dtx6z7x	0	*	>There's no indication that anything was altered.  that's quite optimistic. i'm sure they just poked around and left everything alone. : /
t1_dtx2q2w	1	*	I think we should get the records of every voter to perform an audit on voter fraud. Oh wait... 
t1_dtx5gg3	1	*	And because in many of these places, purging voter rolls is actually what they want to do.  Why settle for just Crosscheck when you can have that *and* Russian influence?
t1_dtx4588	1	*	literally happened to so many Bernie voters (no idea how they could possibly know who you would vote for however)
t1_dtwwacl	0	*	It's been so disappointing to see the deevolution of our society since 2016. It's like half of America said oh wow, it's okay to be a piece of shit again? Nice!!
t1_dtwmk1c	0	*	So you think that them hacking in to there is perfectly fine since currently there is nothing to show they did anything while in there? Really?
t1_dtx25e5	1	*	Which party/candidate won Minnesota?
t1_dtwwt1k	1	*	gross
t1_dtwolx8	0	*	See edit I clarified my statement. 
t1_dtwzeqc	1	*	Isnt that why police have Internal Affairs? 
t1_dtwvsgd	0	*	They're high-lighting how utter incompetent even the top brass of American political hierarchy are.   **How did he defend a hostile nation with that statement?**
t1_dtwz4y4	1	*	Who cares what they think? This is the right way to do it.
t1_dtxr0yg	1	*	Honestly it'll probably get lumped into Mueller's investigation since it's a special council giving them a very broad stroke. 
t1_dtxprqr	0	*	We have 10x the population of you.
t1_dtwzpxv	1	*	This is also how my daughters elementary school does it as well. Solid I tell ya.
t1_dtwwabt	1	*	But reading is hard...
t1_dtzovt3	1	*	Well that does it. Let's just err on the side of caution and believe our last 2 presidents. Problem solved!  [Move along kids, nothing to see here](https://i.imgflip.com/1f0lcn.jpg) 
t1_dtx0y1d	1	*	Sure thing, bud. 
t1_dtwvn6g	0	*	Is it not? Do individual states have that much power over a federal election in America?
t1_du1h1g1	0	*	> They didn't change registration, that's asinine. >  > They used the rolls for a targeted propaganda campaign.  What propaganda?
t1_dtx5fos	0	*	Its not the voting machine.  Its the voter registration records.   Instead of changing votes they would have made it so some people can't vote
t1_dtx3yue	0	*	,      .     .  ...?
t1_dtxgc6c	1	*	As true as that is, weak foreign policy the last decade plus, has led to a stronger Russia. Its not really as easy as just placing sanctions on them until they say sorry. 
t1_dtx4h1c	1	*	Absolutely, the Democratic primary was rigged and I don't accept the results. 
t1_dtx191z	0	*	Or maybe he was just happy that he became president?
t1_dtxc7vx	1	*	Well that's not true!
t1_dtx0z31	0	*	So... Guilty until proven innocent? What kind of mob mentality is that?
t1_dtwxc51	1	*	yeah, let's jump to conclusions and make claims with no evidence. that sounds like such a good idea.

t1_dtwvwfz	0	*	Now I'm confused, because I was [reassured that the election *can't* be hacked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cruh2p_Wh_4)
t1_dtwh7xw	0	*	There have been sanctions since 2014, the more recent ones were stronger sanctions because the first ones obviously didn't work.   So you're both right
t1_dtx68wy	1	*	No prisoner or former prisoner can vote anyway so rights are already withheld to some people.
t1_dtwxwzp	1	*	nah man, the donnie sub says the russians didn't do a thing
t1_dtwzbyq	1	*	I know right... ITS HER TURN!
t1_dtx3v5n	1	*	Its almost as if there are very easy ways to make sure that doesnt happen, instead of throwing the entire system away.
t1_dtx4h77	1	*	Its more plausible that the CIA would do this than it is that Russia would.
t1_dtws8s7	1	*	who is you guys?
t1_dtx8s4f	1	*	Investigation into voter fraud was resisted at every level by people trying to virtue signal against Trump. Nothing will happen until valid voter ID becomes a national standard 
t1_dtwzz8d	1	*	Excuse me, do you speak english?
t1_dtwo7xd	0	*	The electric voting system in the states might as well have been intentionally designed to erase any evidence of tampering or hacking. 
t1_dtx53ge	0	*	The best part of course is that voter registration databases in most states are ... public
t1_dtwwtt3	1	*	Curse those editorialized headlines!
t1_dtwvw25	1	*	Who is they and how do you know who they are?
t1_dtwv8v6	1	*	> It was over the line for me when he fired Comey.  With the Nunes memo released we know this was because of FISA abuses/incompetence.
t1_dtwvv2e	1	*	Because 1- its not new info, and 2- theyre voter registration rolls, its public information....
t1_dtx8l8z	1	*	 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Rather
t1_dtwtohd	1	*	It's been an ongoing investigation since Trump got elected. If we are lucky, we get the full story when Trump is up for re-election.
t1_dtww3gg	1	*	Maybe because they know that things like this happen on their side as well? 
t1_dtwynob	0	*	Source? This article says There is no evidence that any of the registration rolls were altered in any fashion, according to U.S. officials.
t1_dtwn18b	1	*	Nothing? Just look at all the division of people from the mere insinuation of them getting in.
t1_dtwn529	0	*	If this is the way the country works now, then soviet. 
t1_dtx5aer	1	*	I agree actually.

t1_dtwzdd5	1	*	Would have been easier just hacking the credit bureau.
t1_dtx3akh	1	*	So basically the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence?
t1_dtwie5g	1	*	You're being ridiculous. All that has come out is a few people in the DNC here and there who had opinions. 
t1_dtwt6bg	1	*	It's not an argument, but perhaps more a case of them suggesting the chickens have home to roost?  
t1_dtx58ot	1	*	More like:   Russia hacked the election.  Russia interfered with the election.   Russia influenced the election.   Russia *sought* to interfere with the election.   
t1_dtx02mr	1	*	The balance and checks have disappeared.
t1_dtwyqsc	1	*	She has quite a few artificial odds stacked in her favor as well. She *should've* won.

t1_ducsi3q	0	*	From travelling in America and speaking to the people that doesn't appear to be the case. Do you think this relates to the historical low trust Americans have in their media? 
t1_ducv6uu	1	*	I always felt this was fishy. But many of my idiot friends bought it hook, line and sinker. The Russian effort to my-way-or-the-highway far left folks who should know better was a huge success.

t1_ducrqso	1	*	I was gonna say, gotta love these smug idiots who *love* talking down to other people, the redditors are stupid morons who post *on reddit*. Pretty pathetic to be honest.
t1_ducsgzi	1	*	But honestly, why is there an indictment when all these guys did was make fake social media accounts and buy Facebook adds shitting on Hilary? That seems pretty ineffective

t1_ducrl1a	1	*	Twitter just got their first ever profit in it's life after this shit. They will not stop doing it.  Either people stop using the platform or better understand whats going on there
t1_ducje7q	0	*	I would guess that they are specific errors that are common to non native speakers and not simply typos. Potentially sentence structure related, etc.
t1_ducrh9y	1	*	This is exactly what killed Digg.  RIP reddit :(
t1_dudi2fe	1	*	They're trying to rile up what they view as the more impassioned groups in the right and left. They want division and instability above all else.

t1_dsgxg22	1	*	Lmao obviously not. I think we can all admit that. 
t1_dupg0w3	1	*	I'm sure they could figure it out. They do what they so now simply because it's the cheapest way. That's what needs to be addressed. 
t1_duq08f3	0	*	No, we do the same things to the environment with corn, wheat, and potatoes in the US. It's only *BAD* because we can't grow them here, and cuts into corn oil's profits.

t1_dtj5fcr	0	*	He wasn't cleaning it. 
t1_dtj4ibs	1	*	This is my theory as well. It was a suicide, but from a movement point of view and from a religious perspective labeling it a suicide would be too explosive so they call it an accident

t1_duy5a2x	1	*	Mowing down crowds of people = one death. Got it.
t1_duy6yap	1	*	An actual discussion would delve much deeper, longer in time, and be broader than the two topics you want to limit the discussion to.

t1_dsvy2e0	1	*	Do you not understand that the Clinton Foundation is a charity and has nothing to do with the Clinton campaign?  Meanwhile, the above article is about foreign donations directly to Trump's campaign. 
t1_dsvm1jv	1	*	Thank you.

t1_duarskl	1	*	No but I could understand you lacking the reading comprehension to be unable to make that distinction. 
t1_dubbluc	0	*	lmao good luck  I guess the Russians forgot about what they learned in Afghanistan. Apparently watching us fuck ourselves up in there isnt a refresher enough.

t1_duaiz2o	0	*	Putin could care less about the oil, Russia produces plenty, the other members of the Oligarch though would surely benefit from Syrian oil and Putin is quite happy to placate them.

t1_dtp600j	1	*	> Police can't arrest them and probably can't retrieve the stolen stuff.  Yes they can. 
t1_dtpuf3z	1	*	You need to source claims like that
t1_dtp5px8	1	*	If you read past the headline that evidently triggered you, you would have realised that the article pointed out that other countries also failed to pay the charges.

t1_dtvcjok	0	*	The reason it got bad is because the US destroyed the Iraqi army, so they couldn't defend their territory. Now their army is competent and can defend themselves.

t1_dsi7605	0	*	Bosnia's issues socially speaking run far deeper than religion though. It used to be better but recent events did a real number on ethno-religious lines. Albania was my main example though. 
t1_dstbngf	1	*	Sure, and Iran's Golestan National Park is supposed to be pretty gorgeous too, but it entails having to move through another shithole to get there.

t1_dtrc1df	0	*	I imagine most redditors are white/european descent and therefore are more interested in the side of the person of similar descent
t1_dtsdiux	1	*	I never mention Trump nor suggest he was applauding the attacks. You just looked at globbyy's comment and copied and pasted what he wrote.
t1_dtre6ib	1	*	The distinction between terrorist and freedom fighter is only in the aim and in the act.
t1_dtr7fp2	1	*	Do we really need to bring out quotes from Trump that's eerily similar to that guys joke?

t1_dtsm13z	1	*	How exactly is the Alt-Right anti-Western? I thought their whole schtick was to preserve western values.
t1_dtrhxvv	0	*	Most solid response Ive gotten for this question yet. Im used to other Western nations where they charge them with everything at first then reduce the charges as they can prove them.
t1_dtrq3pf	0	*	I mean I am a-okay with classifying nazism as a mental disorder if that's the route we want to go down, no doubt. But we need to treat it anyway.

t1_dts1115	0	*	According to liberals only if your shooting cops because the junkie was killed by one.
t1_dtrmc3x	0	*	Or, you might notice that most poor people typically don't look well groomed or stylish.  By your account you'd think the average Walmart was a Klan headquarters. 
t1_dtrl011	1	*	I also have family in Italy and theyre saying theres no rape, stuff like this happens a once a year or two. People are not raped on the streets, and guns are much harder to get in the US.

t1_dtuj2n6	0	*	Its not impossible to avoid as a consumer, its actually very easy.
t1_dtv1mlk	1	*	Do they use PVC for water supply in the states?  In the UK and Aus, it's PEX (HDPE) for hot and cold lines.  PVC is used for drainage, vents etc. 
t1_dtc4ka5	1	*	Not defending, making rational observations.
t1_dtibn33	1	*	>a lot of people believe it's far less regulated than it is   This. I think he was specifically booed when he said distant relatives, since that's just outright false.

t1_dskg4hc	0	*	Norway has money. The US air force doesn't after spending it all on developing the F-35. It's a perfect match.
t1_dskyv39	0	*	> Fox News constantly complained about EVERYTHING Obama did.  That doesn't make it okay for other people to do.

t1_dsjv75l	0	*	Listen I know he's not the best for the job but I viewed him as the lesser of 2 evils when I voted for him, the other more evil one being Hillary. Let me be clear, he was not my first choice.
t1_dsjyxf7	1	*	what's wrong with bringing in white people?

t1_dsjttqg	0	*	You are a truly disgusting human.

t1_dsk6tfd	1	*	What do you mean? 
t1_dsk5sit	1	*	El Salvador, despite its problems, is a beautiful country with great food and people. The gangs just give us a bad rap. El Salvador has one of the best surginf spots that plenty of tourist visit

t1_dsjxxzm	0	*	That doesn't mean the people coming to America are bad people though. That's what has people so upset about this, it shouldn't be that hard to see that. 
t1_dsjw73m	1	*	If you cant see the relevance youre not very bright.

t1_dsjvyxl	1	*	Correct me if Im wrong but doesnt whataboutism involve a counteraccusation? Comparing Trumps behavior to Obamas is not accusing Obama of Trumps behavior.

t1_dsk4nqr	1	*	They're angry because immigrant took der jerbs.

t1_dsjxjk7	1	*	But we didnt last long.
t1_dsjxjkj	1	*	It's the largest economy on earth. There are economic opportunities there that don't exist in other countries. Doesn't mean it's not a shithole.
t1_dsk41ol	1	*	You would if you had a highly sought after skill set and wanted to make a bunch of money without paying half of it in taxes. Lots of Europeans live and work in the US.

t1_dtg8c9z	1	*	What if I told you that trump isnt behind every bad thing that happens in America... shocker right ? By reading these bipartisanpolitical subreddits youd never have guessed that was even an option 
t1_dugh1d3	1	*	yeah, basically with a huge amount demand of drugs 
t1_dupgmpt	0	*	Blame is always a big thing.  There is always enough to share.    edit:  for example: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/the-american-gun-glut-is-a-problem-for-the-entire-world.html  
t1_duxoelg	0	*	Yes, and sadly, obviously, it's not enough.  We need a real internationl moratorium on whaling and enforcement.  Period.
t1_duwf4xu	0	*	At most, they only give birth every 3-4 years. Hack headline. Source: I flew right whale surveys in Florida for 3 winters and a whole lotta babies were discovered during my last year there. 
t1_dst5caj	1	*	because of the same rubbish report 
t1_dtzcj4j	1	*	It's a reference to a silly youtube video by a guy from Iceland getting angry over daylight savings debate in australia.   https://youtu.be/q5q77MQzU2Q
t1_dtyjvoq	1	*	Change it by 30 minutes and leave it forever  Set it and forget it
t1_dty0m7k	1	*	It's mainly a local issue (state/provincial level), so you'll generally only see posts about it on regional subs, but it's mostly disliked from what I've seen. 
t1_dtxvy85	1	*	Sunset and sunrise are at diff times up there than at your lower latitude, so the shift doesn't seem so impactful to her?
t1_dty03ji	0	*	You are misunderstanding I think, he means the German time zone. After its occupation by the German during WW2 France switched to Central Europe one, while it used to be in the British one.
t1_dtxwlbn	1	*	It's like that if you live on the border of a different time zone already. It's not a big deal.
t1_dtzc07v	0	*	save electricity, loads of electricity
t1_dty0ydi	1	*	There have been countries doing that before. I think Lybia done that before.
t1_dtyg5wa	0	*	Dude. All the extra light we get is being sucked up by hippies with solar panels.   It's like, evened out again. We need to stop solar energy to get the full benefit. 
t1_dty28hb	1	*	Depends on where you are. Turkey is south enough that this does not  (did not) happen on winter time.
t1_dtykq12	1	*	I live in an area without it, much prefered.  
t1_dty6ely	1	*	You could live in Blythe and work in Arizona.  Half the year it's the same time half the year it's not.
t1_dtygggs	1	*	Welcome to the Canadian town of Lloydminster.  It straddles a border, and only one half observes daylight savings
t1_dty2elq	0	*	That ain't how jobs work.
t1_dty5cmm	1	*	AZ doesn't observe daylight savings but I work in a national business.  That's what it's like for me!  Why can't the farmers just get up earlier without changing everyone's clock?
t1_dty79qa	1	*	naw man  getting dark at 3:30 absolutely fucking sucks
t1_dtynyxp	1	*	Happens here in the States for our poor Arizonians  https://www.timeanddate.com/time/us/arizona-no-dst.html
t1_dty38p9	1	*	Many, perhaps most, people don't get anywhere near 8 hours of sleep per night.  If you're getting 5 or 6 hours of sleep then one hour less is an enormous difference.
t1_dty4uax	1	*	By far the most sensible comment in this thread.
t1_dtzgf8q	1	*	Yeah, it might become a different time zone suddenly, ONCE, but at least it won't happen twice a year forever.
t1_dty9v5w	1	*	Yep same but a little later in Britain. I have such good memories of staying out ridiculously late, playing cricket at the park with my dad.  
t1_du1apov	1	*	Seriously? I just assumed that daylight savings meant all of them.
t1_dty8k4n	1	*	Yeah I have to get up in the morning, but my devices have already changed the time automatically. I'll have probably got an hour more/less sleep without realising it. 
t1_dty47t2	1	*	Noo, I love when it gets darker earlier, it actually lets me sleep.
t1_dty7mwf	1	*	We should all just use the same time and it should just mean different things in different places.
t1_dty8ro1	1	*	I find it hilarious that the UK and France are in different time zones, despite the vast majority of the countries overlapping.
t1_dtyfohv	1	*	I just want to see the s.o.b. that supports it. 
t1_dty8bcy	0	*	One of the countries who was pushing up for this reform the hardest was Sweden or Finland, don't remember which. 
t1_dtxy7kc	1	*	Welcome to commuting from indiana to chicago
t1_dtyg991	1	*	If you work in Illinois but live in Indiana, you know the feels (possibly)
t1_dtxyrvz	1	*	They were giving you the chance to make it yourself. Missed it by 6 minutes. 
t1_dty052q	1	*	>I doubt the common American even knows when DST starts and ends  you're probably right, but when it's bombarded by every calendar (physical and virtual) you don't really need to memorize it.
t1_dtye1lw	0	*	The amount of sun in off-work hours changes. That's the point of DST.  
t1_dty5reg	1	*	I believe that would be falling forward.
t1_dtymiyt	1	*	Daylight SAVING.
t1_dtxzuen	1	*	That would be 4/6 and 1 bushel to quarter, in freedom units.
t1_dtxxm6f	1	*	the problem is they forgot to standardise the EU countries geographical locations. until they can deal with that variance it makes sense to have variance in DST 
t1_dty2jx2	1	*	Yeah, this and the y2k thing. Lol
t1_dtxy4nw	1	*	This is the case for many states in the US. I know people who live in Indiana but work across the border in illinois and they are in different timezones
t1_dtxyfgi	0	*	The stupid hour shift happens at 2:00 AM. 10:00 isn't really part of the clock change. 
t1_dtxxwpg	1	*	Yeah, so why make it worse by fucking with the clocks?
t1_dtygg3i	0	*	If you are a neet, absolutely. Too bad that most people have to work/study so they can't just decide to wake up and go to bed whenever.
t1_du1jmep	1	*	Dun dun dun dun dun... 
t1_dty5nph	0	*	No, winter time is not solar noon.
t1_dtxxqdf	0	*	TIL that next time someone asks what I did at work I can answer, I cyberloafed all day.
t1_dtxwypg	1	*	or worse, a country in middle of 2 countries that has the reverse rule of both
t1_dtxv1lj	1	*	Call it quarter past 
t1_dtxw1s8	0	*	I'm an italian who lives in sweden. I think in the south it makes total sense and in the north it doesn't matter because you either have way too much dark or way too much light, nothing in between.
t1_dtxy6zi	0	*	It's sort of like holding your pee. It sucks while you're holding it, but once you get to release it... oh god is it good.
t1_dty9ds9	1	*	The normal term in Europe is just summer time anyway... but I guess a proposal to end summer time would be much less welcomed  especially by Finland, which is championing this one ;-)
t1_dtxyu0q	0	*	What does a clock have to do with how much daylight there is?
t1_dty0uui	0	*	I don't like how my boss has set my schedule, so I'll get around it by redefining time.
t1_dtyut1t	1	*	The number of hours for your evenings in your summer is the same regardless if you use daylight savings time or not. 
t1_dtyb70x	1	*	Yeah, that's why we call it noon.
t1_dtxzj1e	1	*	Chattanooga TN is split between Eastern and Central times zones. Half the town runs at a different time than the other half.
t1_dtyb87o	1	*	Except how is leaving DST all the time any different from never having it? In theory businesses would react the exact same way to both scenarios. 
t1_dtxzy5u	1	*	What is this Bitcoin
t1_dtxw635	0	*	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Solar_time_vs_standard_time.png
t1_dty1xxz	1	*	No it would not be easier.
t1_dty6yjl	1	*	That would be sweet, time travelling every day.
t1_dtypp7m	1	*	Are you a morning person or evening person? Id much rather have the hour in the morning than the evening. 
t1_dty1nci	0	*	46 and 2
t1_dtxvq4y	1	*	Maybe more light in the morning? I would still prefer DTS though.
t1_dtxym52	1	*	This vote does nothing to introduce more variance!
t1_dtxygwb	1	*	First rule of programming: you don't fuck with time.
t1_dty5hcz	0	*	What EU time sync? The EU already has 4 time zones.
t1_dtyb8lu	1	*	Nah. It's fine.  I like my days to be like my life: bleak and empty, devoid of all light.
t1_dtxr2re	0	*	If so I cant imagine why
t1_dtygbxf	0	*	So everything should close at 3:30-4:00 PM? 
t1_dty31ol	1	*	In the North it's vinter :) 
t1_dty2qcs	1	*	Not a problem. Maybe for farmers
t1_dt1rk7l	0	*	...as long as you never run for political office.
t1_dt1g7mv	1	*	This is why much of mexico is off limits to many US government employees.  
t1_dt1jsmk	1	*	Well shit I killed me a Mexican just this morning. America! 
t1_dt10ghb	1	*	Yours must be too to have raised you. 
t1_dt1dx5w	1	*	It's not to well known, but civilians can own guns in Mexico.
t1_dt197dv	0	*	So edgy, don't cut yourself.
t1_dt2l2uj	1	*	/r/stoptrumpspam
t1_dt1nh2k	0	*	Building a wall won't stop US Citizens from being killed in Mexico.  
t1_dt10eo1	1	*	You sound like you don't live close to the border.
t1_dt1moq5	0	*	Although the wall is actually a fence now
t1_dt15ry8	1	*	Would love to see your statistics, for example the DACA recipients have a much lower crime rate than American citizens. 
t1_dt1oqam	1	*	Or US Border Patrol agents killing a Mexican citizen from across the border.   
t1_dsr90uv	1	*	A member of parliament that represents a particular constituency via winning the most votes in a FPTP system. 
t1_dtcukkr	1	*	Clearly the political standings in the US are the complete opposite... 
t1_dtylaff	0	*	The government made it legal, then the people called for a election on it. Then they voted to get rid of it, so then the government started the process to override the vote. 
t1_dtnckth	1	*	Yes because the Congo was a peaceful hub of science and industry before the Belgians got there. /s
t1_du05y0c	1	*	Scream bloody murder and hold hearings - email Limbaugh, Beck, and Hannity the talking points with a bank wire transfer....
t1_dsmomql	0	*	That's a lot better than 57 minutes. 
t1_duwm8ts	1	*	You keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep at night.

t1_dt6nfvl	0	*	It's clear that some millions of founding of RT is the cause of the lack of budget of Roscosmos. /s  May be if USA didn't bring war to Syria Russia wouldn't spend so much in millitary ? 
t1_dujusjy	0	*	The decision was questionable, but not surprising. Same thing happened to his dad: [He was convicted and freed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kun-hee#Samsung_scandal) 
t1_duce370	1	*	It's fucked up.    How will we ever find sauce?

t1_du9ulj5	0	*	Regarding 2, that's also how BBC writes all direct quotations in titles, so it's unfortunately not unambiguous. I do agree that it's appropriate, though
t1_dstfdai	1	*	Keep in mind that the -67C is without windchill. 
t1_dss786p	1	*	It was just vapourlock
t1_dssnw1b	1	*	*looks at username* but how else are we supposed to keep our provincial identity if we cant bitch about being the coldest place around? We need to have something to supplement the rider pride!

t1_dv515pk	0	*	WTF? I've seen a lot of them (within a few years old) going in the 30s to low 40s.
t1_dv51jqv	1	*	Same as the Focus, which in my opinion is one of the best cars Ford made to date.
t1_dts084o	1	*	I think they're considered independent contractors. Or something of the like.
t1_dtmiyz6	1	*	Still not long enough. 
t1_dunb9vp	0	*	Makes sense. The North Pole is known for being objective in reporting on the Israeli Palestinian conflict since they have no ulterior motive that could bias their reporting. 
t1_du5nkml	1	*	2001 was one incident, there was another two in 2008, looks like it might resurface again.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax_hoaxes
t1_dt3rdfk	1	*	This guy posts controversial stuff everywhere. Seems to have an agenda. Look through his post history. He posts like he isn't from America but then says he is.
t1_dtl40eh	0	*	On the other hand, tourists don't want beaches covered in litter.  So if they want a healthy tourist trade, they need to restrict litter across the board.
t1_dtkscbx	1	*	>I went to Thailand a couple of months ago. I was so disheartened by the amount of litter on public beaches.    Yeah.  Was really bad in Bali as well.
t1_dtl3vk9	1	*	That's not exactly because they love plastic.  It's just cheaper than any other option.  It probably doesn't use much more plastic than the plastic lid on a paper cup in other countries.
t1_dt0cjau	0	*	Except the Scottish Police are not enforcing Shariah...
t1_dszsufr	0	*	The Muslim population is 1.4% of the total.  Recruiting efforts aimed at .07% (of any demographic) is a pointless.

t1_dtpawg1	1	*	Russia wants a destabilized United States. Trump can accomplish that. 
t1_due8kfj	1	*	Yeah, so they'll do what they usually do and kill them and the info they may have 
t1_duea7r8	0	*	Yes, but I disagree with punishing people for things we do and don't care about, as long as it's us doing it...  We lose the right to pass judgement by doing it ourselves.
t1_dueekv2	1	*	If anything, it'd make them less willing to extradite. Non-US citizens wanted by the US may be housed in Gitmo. 
t1_dueag7q	1	*	Just thinking any possible scenario, getting them to defect and getting a huge amount of information on the operation.

t1_due91lj	1	*	I'm not sure how what you're saying, that i agree with, excludes what I said.

t1_dt14fj2	1	*	According to China, India is actively downplaying the ranges of its nuclear weapons. Supposedly the ranges are almost double what the Indian govt admits to. 
t1_dt0cspq	0	*	India has a nuclear triad. They can fire from land, air or sea so they don't have to fire from within Indian borders. They can hit any country.

t1_dt71ljn	0	*	>Perhaps the average German isn't as scared of Muslims as you are?  Because Germany isn't bearing the full brunt of Migrants as other countries are.

t1_dsbnp6o	1	*	That's why (s)he said some.

t1_du2uzci	0	*	We *had* intelligent TV when TLC used to be The Learning Channel and Discovery had useful programs. Ratings dropped. Not enough people watch National Geographic or PBS.

t1_dt82fij	1	*	A family friend of mine is a priest who was born in India served at my church and then went back to India. He says Hindu-extremists attack Indian Christians occasionally. So it does exist.

t1_dudvopl	1	*	Exactly. It's all part of his master plan for world domination. 
t1_dueacwo	1	*	Maybe.  I think a space race would ultimately be more productive. When we had one with Russia, we got to the moon in a decade.  When we won that race, we stopped expanding our boundaries.

t1_du61b6i	1	*	In NZ they don't even name the abuser, because the victim can be inferred and as such it breaks privacy laws. Perhaps this is halfway towards that.
t1_du61l4i	1	*	I'd wager it's the norm.

t1_ds53mkd	0	*	Breaking news: rich people are friends and hang out together. 
t1_ds5t5bs	1	*	I love the idea of those things too, but I think its important to distinguish between loving those things and loving Bannon. Bannon is scum. 
t1_ds56ouc	0	*	No ones saying Jenny didn't do a good job, we're just saying some things could have been done better 
t1_ds56gm3	1	*	The easiest explanation is that Bannon is and has always been an opprotunist.
t1_ds5qoqr	1	*	Also possible but the lawyer claims would seem odd in that circumstance.
t1_ds54hkh	1	*	Keep in mind that Bannon is most of all, a strategist.  
t1_ds4w4pi	1	*	Hahaha. Yeah, that part of it is pretty damn cool.  Have an upvote. :) 
t1_ds79cu1	1	*	To be fair, it was Coffee Royale.

t1_ds4z6vg	0	*	The amount of upvotes declined shortly after the election, as did the amount of comments.  Very strange seeing 1k+ upvotes and no comments on rising posts.

t1_ds4yvgw	0	*	>in order to save face  Actually, when Bannon loses face, it is simply molting to make way for his new face. 
t1_ds5gdoq	0	*	Even if this is all proven and he's impeached, he'll likely remain president since the House and Senate are Republican-controlled, correct?
t1_ds5f0u9	1	*	Damn, this guy is the Deepthroat of this era's Watergate.

t1_ds5l5px	1	*	Are you sure about that? HRC supporters could never admit a single wrong thing she did either.  Partisanship makes people retarded.
t1_ds5cz9y	0	*	Because that is how he views the world.  Agreeing with someone == loving them.    It's why they *always* agree with Trump.

t1_dsl0uln	1	*	It was an unnecessary branding of human tissue for no reason whatsoever, unrelated to any medical procedure.  I'd call each case a battery and charge him, appropriately.
t1_dslosu3	0	*	Lots of surgeons are sociopaths.

t1_dswl5a0	1	*	~10 x 10 km. That was hard.
t1_dsw14c5	1	*	Except it's deeply stipid to use area of coverage at all for an oil spill. A single barrel can cover that much.  They just need to state gallons or barrels. Area is a BS metric.
t1_dswicsp	1	*	Well he is stripping down the EPA's regulations which 100% has a big environmental impact
t1_dsvial8	1	*	Well if the U.S Navy can do it several time in a row...

t1_dv38f8u	0	*	Shareblue isnt even allowed on politics anymore smh
t1_dv39jou	0	*	I'd be interested to see mod logs. I don't think there would be much to glean from user logs though.

t1_dv3kupf	0	*	What did I make up? How many times have Russians been used as excuse in cases where American conservatives could be the explanation this last year?
t1_dv36jnx	1	*	It's not intentional, they are ranking by sheer number of posts per hour/day/week etc. That's how active that subreddit is...
t1_dv3eal4	1	*	This seems a limitation or flaw in Reddit as you can easily see how opposing sides would use this, not just a single side. 
t1_dv3fkbv	1	*	Nope. He can't. Because it doesn't happen. But these people cry and say it does anyway because they live in a different reality.
t1_dv3md7x	1	*	The FEC
t1_dv387jq	1	*	I hate this quote. You can criticize the capitalist class and the politicians they own day and night and they don't give a shit because they know there is nothing you can do about it.
t1_dv389n1	0	*	The dotard is a hate site. Theyre not political. Its a safe space for extremists to gather. 
t1_dv36sgg	1	*	Because any American who doesn't loathe the President and t_D is a tool of the Russians and therefore the *real* enemy! is exactly the sentiment this campaign is trying to encourage.

t1_dv3gu63	0	*	LOL, no, but nice attempt at false equivalence.  Russians aren't targeting the left because they realized the left doesn't buy into their bullshit as easily.  
t1_dv39tds	0	*	Yeah, homie. That's exactly what is being said here.  Thanks for giving a safe haven for foreign propaganda, though. Really helps. Super.

t1_dv38xu5	1	*	Oh man those were the good old days. The GOLDEN age of memes, I would say.   Nobody is gonna give 4CHAN credit anymore. All those weirdos get off the hook.
t1_dv3haic	1	*	They literally posted something anti-Trump on t_d, got banned for it, and you want to crucify them and ignore their point just because ... Why?
t1_dv367bs	1	*	The Russians did indeed exploit Bernie supporters. Hillary made it really easy to do...

t1_dv4hxgn	0	*	manipulating conservatives?  Um no.. it was your Bernie voters that were swayed to vote for Trump by Russia shit posting memes to Facebook.  You need to clean up your own idiots first.

t1_dv37mey	1	*	I got banned because I said one word: Agreed
t1_dv3t3wl	1	*	Those lists aren't manually sorted, it's based on some metric of activity, which is why AskReddit is pretty much always at the top (lots of comments).
t1_dv3738q	0	*	I've no doubt that there are russian trolls doing that, but I wouldn't completely disregard leftover anger over how the DNC handled the primaries, and the aftermath of all that.

t1_dv5zcqf	1	*	Dalits are not a race or ethnicity. They are just a caste. Basically in the past, your caste determined your profession. Dalits were at the bottom of society and did all the manual labour etc.
t1_dv5fow8	1	*	A significant proportion of redditors still haven't come around on the idea of Muslims even being human, bit much to expect that lot to believe anything positive about an entire country of them.
t1_dtmzjf0	0	*	Did you just assume their political leaning?!
t1_duc7y2e	1	*	Like when frank sinatra was kidnapped by mobsters to perform at their birthday.  Edit: I looked into it and the story i was remembering was al capone kidnapping Fats Waller.

t1_dtbgp09	0	*	I don't trust go fund me too many time a random stranger is starting them then probably running away with the money
t1_dselic6	1	*	Let's not count our eggs before they hatch. All that needs to happen is Obama to agree with it and Trump will probably turn it into a gigantic mall instead.

t1_dtbj7cf	0	*	Fuck it. Just get rid of timezones. One clock for all!
t1_dtauuuu	0	*	As a Canadian who lives much further north, I say who cares? More light at the end of the day is much more preferable.
t1_dt9vzec	0	*	And the issue going to school/work when it's dark is? We have street lights and other forms of artificial light that can without a problem brighten the darkest night.
t1_dtatj6r	0	*	Children already wait in the dark.  
t1_dt9yemq	1	*	Not what we were sold in Europe. People getting back earlier from work would need less light, hence energy, supposedly.   Talk about a stupid calculation :-(
t1_dtaoc4f	0	*	Oh no! Not *darkness*! How will those poor children survive.
t1_dtasz9x	1	*	I'm pretty sure I didn't suggest that daylight savings time changes the rotation of the earth, but very good job inventing something to argue about.  
t1_dt9v2rj	0	*	The sun does dip behind the horizon for most fins, afaik, isn't that correct?  But anyway, if most fins want that then fine by me of course.
t1_dta8qrn	0	*	This is just wrong and I have no idea why its being upvoted.
t1_dtqqwb8	0	*	> I think the military wants to create what we commonly refer to as tactical nukes  Create? We have plenty of those, same as Russia.

t1_dskhk5j	1	*	Read the quote again
t1_dskegmm	0	*	Vicente Fox lives in a country where people are kidnapped off the streets to be tortured mutilated and have whatever is left of their corpse hung off highway overpasses. 
t1_dskg3c1	0	*	Absolutely correct. People on the left seem to be in love with Fox, do they know the corruption and bad state he left Mexico in?
t1_dskfmwq	1	*	Well maybe, just maybe, because the majority coming to the US are undocumented...
t1_dskgcun	1	*	How about favoring the middle class, which is what GP almost certainly had in mind? 
t1_dskfr1j	1	*	Mr. Fox cursed at Mr. Trump on live television. Hes also prone to cursing in private like Trump.

t1_dsf72sr	1	*	i mean its right but its not relevant to anything in this thread
t1_dsew4y4	0	*	They are also simultaneously being sued by a group of women for being biased against women. 'Amazingly' people with a victim complex always see the hits against their in-group

t1_dsq1u4c	1	*	>How many ppl has Christianity killed  Early Christian devotees were even more hardcore than radical Muslims, actually. It's just that the earth population was much smaller
t1_dspi18j	1	*	You completely stopped reading OP's post, didn't you? 
t1_dsr9rqs	1	*	Yeah, but on his scale being a God is about 4 steps below being a Donald.

t1_dsx6tj0	0	*	Is that the official response from the empire?
t1_dsx54c8	1	*	Or organise the defense they never had.
t1_dsx5180	1	*	> the civil war in Donbass  Yep that's the lie. But after the annexation of Crimea by Russia nobody is going to believe it. 
t1_dszvb9c	1	*	Because it's true. Great minds think alike :)
t1_dtrfv36	1	*	Preach
t1_dtrfxss	1	*	Always ahead of the curve that show
t1_dtreqtw	1	*	If you dont like what someone is constantly posting just unfollow them. It is not that difficult
t1_dtrg6qr	1	*	In my experience it's the idiots who post the most. So maybe the few dumbshits are your only friends posting consistently.
t1_dtrsc4f	1	*	Same! And an official ID.

t1_dtrxp8y	1	*	Aweeee. You and me would be good friends IRL.
t1_dtrmxih	1	*	Because everyone is dependent on that stupid website these days. 
t1_dtrbfn6	0	*	You can usually find the counter echo on reddit though. Sure you have to go look for it (or wait long enough for whats cool to not be cool and the not-cool thing is cool), but its there at least. 
t1_dtyc0de	0	*	Do they refuse low quality and demand high res?
t1_dtrq62h	1	*	 You can not block my style Mark 
t1_dtrcneg	1	*	ITunes is fucking cancer
t1_dtrbciv	0	*	And it's not necessarily that he is stalking you, it's just Facebooks algorithms decided to show your whole friend list that you think that business is shitty.
t1_dts5aal	1	*	Yeah Snapchat definitely prevents a lot of stupidity from being saved for forever.
t1_dtra1tg	1	*	Haha I remember this. U0001f602 
t1_dtrg5ts	1	*	Or the same 7 people constantly posting political crap, which 90% of the time are fake memes.
t1_dtrr456	0	*	Reddit is the best social network. It's not mainstream enough to be used by parents. Most don't know how Reddit even works.
t1_dtrpbaj	1	*	I realized that I wasn't seeing people's posts because the timeline automatically sorts by best, not by new. So if they didn't have a thousand friends they would instantly get buried in crap posts
t1_dtrbon7	1	*	Reddit is better precisely because it is anonymous.
t1_dtrow2d	1	*	so wait, how do you have 1000 friends? 
t1_dtro284	1	*	Or you could just stop using it...
t1_dtsv4a5	1	*	That plus the Facebook Purity plug in. Facebook is awesome when you eliminate 75% of it!
t1_dtrey7j	1	*	As if the messenger app isn't pure cancer.
t1_dtrab0u	1	*	I disagree with you and believe you can get opinions from both sides of the argument. In expressing this view to be seen by you I have disproved your argument. FlyEaglesFly

t1_dtrid95	1	*	Experienced this at a place I worked. Deleted account and got a fake name one for friends. No way I'm letting them use my online social life against me. 
t1_dtrdt64	1	*	I started my local community college in Los Angeles with my .edu mail. Before that, it didn't exist on FB.
t1_dtrq1q9	1	*	My sister thinks my wife and I are Satanists now, which we find hilarious and play up as much as we can just to piss her off. The laughing from her rants are worth the damage.
t1_dtrcmx0	1	*	fucking exactly. That's why others have avoided that shit like the plague. Learn from Facebook's failures. 
t1_dtrl50q	1	*	/r/oldpeoplefacebook
t1_dtrizht	1	*	Hmm... within the fb platform?

t1_dtra9sw	1	*	MySpace anyone?
t1_dtrjq3x	1	*	I'm sorry Auntie, I did log into facebook but their algorithm decided cousins baby just wasn't interesting enough to make my feed. Perhaps a phone call next time?
t1_dtrjr55	0	*	Nah, that's too real  I'm just looking for something that would be less heavy on hardware, give me more and better feed, and would be pretty popular already
t1_dtrgklp	1	*	I deleted all the news pages and any other page that delivered news related content that I was following.... now it's all food photos and memes
t1_dtrfnyl	1	*	Just unfollow the ones that just post shit. I just filtered all the shit from my feed (you can also click that you're not interested in something) and now it's allright.
t1_dtrlarx	1	*	LinkedIn is a perfectly acceptable and even preferred substitute.
t1_dtroe7j	1	*	/r/forwardsfromgrandma
t1_dtrc43m	1	*	Instagram is owned by Facebook
t1_dtrog3y	1	*	My aunt used to do that. Commented on everything, usually rude or not even relevant. I blocked her from my posts and she lost her shit on me at a family event. Good times.
t1_dtri9dx	0	*	Or just set your profile picture to a big ol' swastika, then they can't find you as easy.  *taps temple

t1_dtrc3di	1	*	You afraid they're going to start calling you MemeLord at family gatherings?
t1_dtrf490	1	*	Yeah, Facebook owns Instagram so not surprising
t1_dtrhayn	1	*	Tumblr and Reddit worked out well for me to get away from all that. 
t1_dtrd9a2	1	*	Or the people you do see posts from are always the same handful.
t1_dtrayyw	1	*	It's still great as a college student.  All of my clubs have a convient page on it and it's message function is extremely convenient.  
t1_dtrkx40	1	*	Please share how you do this!  The only reason I still have Facebook is because I don't want to remove myself from group chats with real friends. 
t1_dtrnm59	0	*	IN THE MIDDLE! If the ad was up front and started at the beginning like YouTube Id be more inclined to watch it, but the interruption is an insult!
t1_dtrwy8h	0	*	So, what you are saying is the way to make Facebook bigger, is to grow Facebook?

t1_dtrcls1	1	*	It's not really that much time. I probably check it 3 or 4 times a week for 15 minutes or so. Thank you for your concern, though.
t1_dtrfyjv	1	*	Without Facebook the local music scene would become a desert. It's the only place some bands have a presence in many cases.

t1_dtrsxjc	0	*	> Deleted my facebook because of this.  You know that it's not really deleted, right?  Facebook still has everything you ever posted.  So glad I never had anything to do with them.
t1_dtrhtn1	1	*	How about you check their timeline and see for yourself if they post anything you lazyass 
t1_dtraejo	1	*	High schoolers don't use the platform thou.
t1_dtrm7b2	1	*	That is brilliant,thanks!  Going to have to try that 
t1_dtrfrs3	1	*	>One girl said How do you talk to people?  Should've boggled her mind and responded with The old fashioned way before Facebook ever existed. Just like we're doing right now. 
t1_dtspw8r	0	*	I hear you but what's the rush?
t1_dtraoj1	1	*	You're not, don't worry.  Even if you have a FB account never ever bring it up. Probably just as bad as sharing your pornhub account tbh lmao
t1_dtrov4x	1	*	Yeah, facebook was like this in the old days it just showed you everything.  Then the dark times came and not only did the algorithms come but so did parents, other family members and co workers....
t1_dtror6c	1	*	Obama? Grrrr 
t1_dtt85y6	1	*	I actually like the memories feature. A lot of what I post is about my kids, and it can be funny seeing their photos or stories from a few years ago. 
t1_dtrcdl3	1	*	If the population keeps growing then please explain why this is literally impossible.
t1_dtr8kx3	1	*	I remember when it was The Facebook and only certain schools had access to it. I was not at one of those schools; my brother was, however.

t1_dubi5o0	1	*	That's because the American president is in league with the Russians, when he is gone the rules will change and Russia will come to mean regret.
t1_dubkf3v	1	*	On the other hand, suggesting that the middle ground is right simply because it isn't either extreme is fallacious 
t1_dubpc48	1	*	Whatever, it's so easy to make accounts to use that aren't new either, there's no way to really tell.
t1_dubqqat	1	*	you can get a car in australia for 40.8604$km^2
t1_duc58q6	0	*	I don't know about you but the fear of invasion from Russia isn't why I don't run around shooting people. 
t1_dubpu2k	0	*	Where are any of the links relating to the bots being Russian?  I clicked on 3 of them and nothing is related to what they purportedly support
t1_dubj8l5	0	*	I mean using russian hackers as a pretense to have more control of the internet as a whole
t1_dubpeau	1	*	And selling speakers out of the back of a van?
t1_duc86u9	1	*	Haha I don't know why I did that, but I initially wrote the comment with a Russian accent in my head.  In mother Russia, comment writes you! 
t1_duboxqz	1	*	I think youre projecting 
t1_dubq9bc	0	*	Nah, man. Even a divided America is still more solid than a unified Russia. And they are not unified. They are worse off than anyone.
t1_dubb4sg	1	*	^beep boop 
t1_duc5ptb	1	*	Reddit should implement a similar system as they have on one of the big blogs in the Netherlands, where new accounts are marked as New with a baby icon. Could help spotting new bots.
t1_dubqgqz	0	*	>  Russia thing is actually a well established fact.  Not to anyone with a background in IT or an IQ above 40.
t1_duc24ws	0	*	You're right. We should just bring pitchforks instead!
t1_dubo4kq	0	*	Shit. Except for that last one, this all sounds *real* familiar. Not a good sign.
t1_dublpo2	1	*	Who could be so cruel as to manipulate others in order to raise the value of one's portfolio?  ...buy icx and req everyone!
t1_dubnp9o	0	*	Well they do. Every mass shooting of late has been alt-right Republican terrorist.
t1_dubow7j	0	*	Sorry I couldn't get past the 110% concentrated MURICA in the first 5 seconds.
t1_ducg6gy	0	*	> Russia Today and Sputnik News,  But my idiot Russophile friend insists that Russia Today is no less reliable than literally any other news outlet!
t1_dublgtl	1	*	There's nothing wrong with wanting to spread a positive message about yourself.  There is something you immoral in trying to insight chaos in a population.
t1_dubqo0p	1	*	> However Russia has nearly perfected the art of dezinformatsiya  I think you mean disinformation. Saying a word in Russian to make it sound scary or foreign is just silly.
t1_dubcbi6	1	*	Eh I'll stick with upvotes and downvotes for now
t1_dubv49y	1	*	I see a lot of assertions.
t1_dubruc1	1	*	I give you gold, but uhh.. assets somewhat illiquid this month.  Maybe after midterms?
t1_ducfz0h	1	*	I'm not even joking when I say maybe you need psychological support with respect to persistent paranoia vis a vis Russians. Like talk to a professional, just to see what they have to say. 
t1_dubmc1u	1	*	Lol I hate it on Reddit when people act like its so superior to all other social media, when in reality its no better than the rest of it. All platforms have their flaws. 
t1_duc6xec	1	*	I think you mean this one https://youtu.be/zeMZGGQ0ERk
t1_dubm75u	0	*	If they could care less why don't they?
t1_dubakjr	1	*	divide and conquer
t1_dubohrg	1	*	> pro net neutrality comments  Sounds like you don't even know what you're talking about. Those were anti net neutrality comments.
t1_dubpmui	1	*	Seriously though? Curious too.
t1_duboy24	0	*	Just went to his profile. Why did you flat out lie?
t1_dubrezt	1	*	More specifically Adidas track suits
t1_dubp5te	1	*	Can you link me to example?
t1_dud51d8	1	*	take your upvote
t1_dubmqxa	1	*	Unless you're a lurker.
t1_du10sfq	1	*	You could just as well substitute corporates saying What about my margins? with customers saying This one's expensive. Better buy the other one.
t1_du1aj3z	1	*	One would think that wouldn't be an insurmountable issue or that there are some formulas that are thicker and would support more dense particulate matter in suspension. 
t1_du0r1p3	1	*	I'm not even sure how you would even approach that, would you bag it up? What if I accidentally pop the bag? And water doesn't make a good lubricant. I think I'll just stick to my hand
t1_dtup5sc	1	*	I AM the Senate
t1_dswar0p	0	*	Yea that's why euro companies of a monopoly on raw African resources.  That's why African countries still have to pay a colonial tax to euro powers  Wake up and smell the coffee 
t1_dscw3cu	0	*	Funny they aren't in power. 
t1_dxqx0j0	1	*	Hello rmacd. You hurt my feelings when you said `Bad bot`. Now I will make your life miserable until you apologize.
t1_dsncbtc	1	*	Yeah but at least they beat London by 4 
t1_dsmo0pu	0	*	That's nothing. I plan to quit Reddit every time I open Reddit. Which is more frequently than a dozen times per day.
t1_dsmj8wn	1	*	xa3500 million over 30 years is really, piss all.    Probably one of the best things they can do in terms of economic return.
t1_dt6k54z	1	*	Yea but if congress wont allow more than 1 jJan michael vincent to each quadrant we are doomed...
t1_dtldbey	1	*	Make vegan food free, paid for with taxes on meat entirely.  people will switch.
t1_dtkzv01	0	*	And we paid them to do it time and time again, happily!
t1_dtl7o60	1	*	Global government? What do you mean by that?
t1_dtkz4tm	0	*	Yes, I Agree.
t1_dtl1l8s	0	*	Upvote for sharing my righteous anger and also for the use of cunting.

t1_dtkyjjv	0	*	Is it typical to use that drug though 
t1_dtl3rvo	0	*	They're poor? How so?
t1_dtkvjfv	1	*	What do you mean my vegan superpowers don't include total immunity to microbes?!?
t1_dtkwiwx	0	*	Bro, we want our chicken. You can't just tell people what they can and cannot eat.  That would be racist.
t1_dtl9rhd	0	*	You have no idea what you're talking about. In India vegetarianism is tied to social status and notions of spiritual purity. Generally the wealthy are far more likely to be vegetarian than the poor.
t1_dtl6ni7	1	*	This is why I'm on reddit.
t1_dtla880	1	*	Pretty much the same in Turkey. 
t1_dtl1ep3	1	*	The vast majority of antibiotics are used industrially, and many outbreaks of resistant bacteria have been traced back to farms.
t1_dtl4dph	1	*	What the fuck am I watching...? 
t1_dtl4qpx	1	*	Any chance most of those are placebos?
t1_dtl12nz	1	*	Great, now I'm craving chicken feet! 
t1_dtlbsv4	1	*	Oh God you're all going to die.
t1_dtli8mm	1	*	This is like real life version of pandemic game.
t1_dtky0hi	1	*	Consider raising your own.
t1_dtl1xhd	1	*	I think I'd rather they go back to ingesting rhino horn...
t1_dtl3dvl	1	*	Mxe9xico does the same and I hate it.
t1_dtl9o3q	1	*	Why the fuck did anyone make VETERINARY colistin? That's just asking for exactly this thing to happen. Hold the companies accountable.
t1_dtktd46	1	*	An even better idea.
t1_dtlb7ji	1	*	You are already dead, Reddit is just purgatory.
t1_dtlluf6	1	*	The fact it's just used in farming to benefit profit too is pretty sick really! You're very welcome, thank you for taking the time to read it.
t1_dtksi4g	1	*	Well, vegetables are grown in shit.
t1_dtlbfwb	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_dtktgqv	0	*	That's great to hear, hats off to you people for making the world a better place. I hope our govs get their priorities straight though.
t1_dtky7mo	1	*	Tell to that Venky's as well as the American corps who knowingly buy meat treated with colistin
t1_dtky3mp	1	*	You can just say capitalism.
t1_dtlfa5h	1	*	oh shit
t1_dtksrj4	1	*	Oh god pls no. I got this last year and felt pretty shitty for a month.
t1_dtks2b6	1	*	...and when they jump onto human hosts we ~~are fucking done~~ will transition to phages instead of antibiotics.  There.  FTFY.
t1_dtkyi35	1	*	Or do the opposite and build your immune system up in preparation.
t1_dtkpve9	0	*	So, what's the reason that we aren't up in arms about their use in US and EU?
t1_dtl4d3l	1	*	It's not a protein, it just has amino groups. Probably still blasted to hell if you cook it tho
t1_dtkx16d	1	*	But i have the flu!
t1_dtl0wnl	1	*	This makes me sad, disappointed, and pissed off all at once.
t1_dtl5469	1	*	You don't need any meat in your diet. Vegan and vegetarian diets are approved by all major nutrition and health organizations.
t1_dtkwx55	1	*	*KFC slogan*
t1_dtl4oza	1	*	> given to the birds to protect them against diseases or to make them gain weight faster   ostensibly given to prevent diseases, but really given because they gain weight faster...
t1_dtl1xvm	0	*	But I already don't buy chickens from India.
t1_dtks0fj	0	*	Yeah.  Plus nature keeps kicking out newer, better ones automagically, so adaptation/resistance isn't as much of an issue.
t1_dtkxecg	1	*	Theyre not stupid. Theyre greedy. 
t1_dtkulik	0	*	Even in developed countries though, most meat is made used some antibiotics, just not as much. Its not like the problem is nonexistent elsewhere.
t1_dtkjb7t	0	*	Can I get a TLDR? I cant be bothered clicking that.
t1_dtl19w5	1	*	In most parts of China you dont even need a prescription for antibiotics. 
t1_dtl186u	1	*	I can't decide what's worse, hunting animals to extinction to make fake medicine that doesn't work, or using real medicine where it doesn't do any good and making it unusable in the future.
t1_dtnoyc1	1	*	IMO it is better to impose strict limits on population than it is to try to make people do without luxuries. 
t1_dtkvuhv	1	*	And that similar practices are very common in the US.
t1_dtl3l1o	0	*	>  raped the poodle in a ditch  and I have a new favorite phrase, thanks
t1_dtkt6pk	0	*	Not just India. I've went to a pharmacy in Thailand because of a mild cold/headache, first thing the pharmacist suggested was antibiotics
t1_dtl2z1w	1	*	But now they're cooped up together like the chickens. Antibiotics must be used to prevent infection. Super bugs form in the space station. Everyone perishes regardless.   It's almost a happy ending.
t1_dtl0mst	1	*	Its the same in Kuwait. I got fever a couple of times and they prescribed me some sort of antibiotic used mostly in case of anthrax attack! The included pamphlet warned of some horrific side effects!
t1_dtkv82i	1	*	thats gotta be bad for the microbiota, probably gonna see a lot of GI problems in the near future.
t1_dtl0p86	0	*	In my Microbiology class, I read a paper on the percentage of antibacterial-resistant bacteria in a Chinese pig farm, it was disturbing. 
t1_dtl8f7r	0	*	The chickens are hurting during their entire short lives.
t1_dtky95t	1	*	For fast relief, crack a bone in half and shove the splintered end into the nearest vein.  
t1_dtl0v74	1	*	So at what point do nations develop antibiotics and refuse to share them?
t1_dtkv6w4	1	*	Actually, and as planned, no one is going to make it.  Well... there will be some wealthy. And their slaves, of course.
t1_dtl4y90	0	*	have you seen any progress with Usnic acid or its salts?
t1_dtkxkn8	1	*	To be entirely honest, it would serve us well to embargo countries that cripple our efforts to save lives in this way until they stop fucking doing this.
t1_dtkwz5l	0	*	How long until this is available? Can bacteria develop resistance to it?
t1_dtl1xyg	1	*	You should have mentioned  the gangbang rape problem they have instead of CO2...
t1_dtlfmp5	1	*	Tbf, I live in Canada and I've seen coworkers being prescribed anti biotics for the cold/flu... 
t1_dtkyfel	1	*	A lot of people in the us are that way.
t1_dtl5j5d	1	*	My wife and her in-laws are Russian. Our daughter came down with the flu, and her parents told us to get her some antibiotics. We had to argue that those won't help at all.
t1_dtkxtkf	1	*	I was actually talking about the super chickens. Didn't think about the germs though.
t1_dtltsku	1	*	Pretty much
t1_dtl3f2n	1	*	I lived in South Korea about 15 years ago.  The doctors there were doing the same thing, even for headaches.
t1_dtlm1bs	1	*	They live close to a place that will soon have diseases that nobody will be able to stop with any luck whatever is unleashed will be lethal and spread slowly.
t1_dt4o7yg	1	*	thank you, **slaves.**  Ftfy
t1_dt4o2km	0	*	The North had a much stronger economy than the South.

t1_dthh61q	0	*	>Trump just announced that he won't be enforcing the sanctions against Russia   How dare Trump not want to inch closer to a World War 3 with Russia.

t1_dth6ap9	0	*	Woah wait what? Where's the source on that?
t1_dthf1bt	0	*	Just because you're a republican doesn't mean you have to support Trump... 
t1_dtha88p	0	*	Wait for them to determine that he's not guilty? Like they have all the other times....
t1_dthv39d	0	*	you people?!
t1_dthovus	1	*	Like I said, you are turning a blind eye to the crimes being committed by the Justice Dept, the Media, the Government, etc because you hate Trump. Thanks for making my point. 
t1_dthbh41	0	*	Yeah, they conspired against Trump by helping him to get elected.  Some serious mental gymnastics going on. 
t1_dthhy5l	0	*	I was talking about the left and their Trump-Russia collusion nonsense
t1_dthq3ke	1	*	Have fun unifying with people waving swastikas and shouting Blood and soil. Those people are not neighbours.
t1_dtiiu59	0	*	Even if it comes from, let's say RT or Wikileaks?
t1_dthd72f	0	*	I'm not surprised. Every time I go to the gym and see Fox News on, it's always something about Hillary.
t1_dthfdp4	0	*	More than half of the nation seems to dislike him so that's probably a fact.
t1_dthgyc7	1	*	Fox News is cancer with regard to that. They pretty much have a foot in the door of the breitbart-esque news.
t1_dthcctl	1	*	Humble brag or are you speaking from experience that you look down on those who think critically?
t1_dthkki8	1	*	Someone give this man gold 
t1_dthyrvv	1	*	what if we're the swamp and we're the ones being drained
t1_dthfnz9	1	*	What a world we live in where people genuinely believe this. Truly the dankest of timelines.
t1_dthmtx1	0	*	I mean its kinda absurd to think that trump had sex and prostitutes peed on him in the same room obama stayed in just as a big fuck you.   The whole thing reads like a fan-fiction
t1_dthhjbz	1	*	I made a status about this maybe a few months ago. I had no idea there was a documentary on this. Thanks!

t1_dthlqzh	1	*	Are you kidding me? There is so much evidence it hurts!  \*goes fishing\*
t1_dthlem4	0	*	Start from the beginning and reeducate yourself on foundational truths. Learn philosophy, game theory, physics, for a start.

t1_dthf1bk	1	*	Im willing to bet a large part of the problem is the lack of rhetoric education. 
t1_dthhzo2	1	*	It's front page and everyone is swinging by to watch the meltdown, and it's really hard to see people being so obnoxious and not throw a little salt in your wounds.
t1_dthsbt7	1	*	This is epic. Spent the last hour reading the entire thing. Politicians, tech leaders, money, espionage.... And how long this has been going on. Wow. 
t1_dti16vn	0	*	A simply stunning example of whataboutism.  How people get so defensive about comments like this to the point of blindly forming knee-jerk fallacies in response, I'll never know.
t1_dthjdy7	0	*	If Putin really wants to start a fire he should just admit that he colluded to make trump president. The west would implode.

t1_dthn9nr	0	*	Yeah well you should stop molesting children
t1_dthf34l	1	*	Oh yeah? Where's the evidence of democrats colluding with a foreign government to win an election? Cut it out with the both sides bullshit. 
t1_dthj1o9	1	*	Ain't that the truth. U0001f625

t1_dthe0cf	1	*	I think it was Ben Franklin that said something like, We're not rational beings, we're rationalizing beings. That thought has struck quite a chord with me lately
t1_dthcz32	1	*	I mean, I'd put it as far back as Clinton, or Bush Sr at least on the Constitutional Crisis side...  But in reality there is always some kind of shady shit going on when it involves the government.

t1_dthve88	1	*	Everyone has an agenda and and all major outlets are compromised, including Reddit. Public opinion is being manipulated and controlled on many levels.
t1_dthxnbc	1	*	Any other president not in debt to Putin would enforce the sanctions passed with 98% congressional approval. Keeping Trump in office is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
t1_dthf3w2	1	*	We're our own worst enemies.
t1_dthe06x	0	*	And by name. The Trumpets again and again state that anonymous sources are not credible.   But then again they believe child-eating Satan rings are real simply because someone likes pizza so yeah.
t1_dti2lly	0	*	Liar.
t1_dthd88v	1	*	Exactly.. one cant be true without the other being at least partially wrong; personally, I find something exposing biases more credible than something exposing a crime, if that makes sense
t1_dti2zuz	1	*	See, that just shows how uneducated you are.  Of course we have a government. As long as a new government is not formed the old one is still in charge.
t1_dthffov	0	*	Its the rights version of shareblue

t1_dtw47w7	1	*	The politics they make are green/socialist at least.  Just because merkel joined the CDU after leaving the DDR (purest socialism) doesn't mean shes making conservative politics.
t1_dtvxk6k	1	*	....should we tell him?
t1_dtw186q	1	*	Productivity increased because people are replaced with machines, but did jobs not decrease, and did companies not struggle to pay for automation AND massively overinflated wages?
t1_dtw7dr9	1	*	Exactly, theres a reason why companies want you to work 40 hours. Its the right balance of productivity.

t1_ds4g3cm	0	*	Please tell, what is the proper grasp of the sitiation?
t1_ds3r30y	1	*	Yep   Also foreign aid is pretty much the cheapest way to conduct foreign policy. Removing it just opens the door for more Chinese or Russian influence in the region.

t1_dt1utky	1	*	There needs to be assets included, because net =/= gross.
t1_dt211xc	1	*	having a net worth of 0 puts you above like 40% of america, looking at net worth is a terrible metric

t1_dt1rzoa	1	*	I completely agree.

t1_dt28kff	1	*	That's not true. Someone else disproved this stat higher up in the comments 
t1_dt1jytd	1	*	You need to make more than $32k USD per year to be in the global 1%; I assure you there are a *lot* of people below that, even in English-speaking countries (myself included).

t1_dt1y0lb	1	*	The top 0.1% could say the same, claiming the real problem lies with the top 0.01% and so on.
t1_dt1xhlr	1	*	Yeah, wages are sticky. Wealth (especially theoretical wealth as opposed to cash) can be a lot more volatile.

t1_dsuwhw3	1	*	The article said the overstay rate for Haitians using the program in the past was 40%.  You can question the validity of that number but, if true, thats pretty damn bad.
t1_dsv6upp	0	*	Then Trump will hit the goods with a tax when they come in the country. So the owner won't out source the jobs 
t1_dsuxmmr	1	*	Which is exactly why it makes sense for veryone else to freak out, but not them to propose or carry out this petty thing.
t1_dsv58rz	0	*	What do they do when its not season? These type of immigrants are going to take more than they give. They will depend on the rest of the country to provide for them. 
t1_dsuv0sp	1	*	Just think, if we did that after WW2, we'd never have a rocket program, which means no NASA, which means no technical innovation, which means no internet. 
t1_dsusvth	1	*	So? It's a step in the right direction. Why do we need migrants from other countries to do low skilled labor when we have Americans that need those jobs?
t1_dsuuthg	1	*	Buildings crushed, infrastructure crumbled, and flooding a believe. 
t1_dsuuzr4	1	*	How fucking dumb are you
t1_dsvbexy	1	*	OP is talking about fraud and your answer is it's not massive. What kind of moral values do you have?  Any fraud is unacceptable.
t1_dsv4tba	1	*	So it's a labor exploitation visa. Nice. 
t1_dsv6ebp	1	*	You don't understand, the reason it was so low in the first place were stringent hurdles and controls to prevent fraud, but it turned out to not be enough, so that's why Haiti gets the ban.
t1_dsuqrjl	0	*	>Since it was targeted to a specific race  Oh, are all black immigrants no longer allowed to come to America?

t1_dsus7uo	1	*	This is literally the republican position. We do not need low skilled labour. It's the democrats who make everything about race it's so exhausting.
t1_dsv4kwf	1	*	Our doctors pay a fraction for malpractice insurance as well.
t1_dsutpyc	1	*	Not even 100 a year. Just banning people from entering the USA for no reason other than they are black and brown. MAGA
t1_dsuy1ww	1	*	The guy quoted in the article said he couldnt find anyone local to do the job. 
t1_dsuzmq8	1	*	> Racism and blocking aside  No. This is the real issue. This move is racist. It doesn't matter whether and how existing Americans happen to benefit from this racist move.
t1_dsuu1ys	1	*	The bot left out the reason the program was ended was because of a DHS report that said that of those that came over on these visas in 2016, 40% overstayed their visas.
t1_dsut5a3	1	*	> Boosting the minimum wage went over fine in high-wage Alberta  If we're being honest, a lot of places in Alberta were already paying more than what the minimum wage was set to.
t1_dsvkv0h	1	*	No country wants low skilled workers immigrating to their countries, not even Reddit favorites like Sweden or Norway, but somehow *we* are the bad guys when we say the same thing.  Its ridiculous.
t1_dsuszvm	1	*	Sure. But whats your point?  We should give him a break?
t1_dsuvyrl	1	*	Of Obama wont get flak for that. And people wont see this as more jobs for Americans.  We all see in different shades.
t1_dsute82	1	*	It's Reddit. That's why
t1_dsv8me1	1	*	Indeed.  There was no indication in the title that this was more of an expiration of existing help rather than just saying screw you to a nation at random.
t1_dsvgd72	1	*	Remember that's about 100 over 2 years. 
t1_dsur254	0	*	Your statement doesn't make sense given the article is about barring poorly trained people from Haiti. 
t1_dsusvct	0	*	But according to democrats most illegal immigrants do not come across our southern border and instead overstay their visa

t1_dsux5vf	1	*	He was a horrible person way before he ever entered politics!
t1_dsv2myn	1	*	I dunno, ask Trump. He brings in labor on these visas for Maralago and Trump Winery every year.
t1_dsv78uf	1	*	I would be fine with it if the Supreme Court was dissagreed with Trump. You assume too much
t1_dsuq9b5	1	*	Or at the very least it's discriminatory towards Haitians. I'm sure there's other groups of people that overstay their visas, we will see if they also get a ban.
t1_dsv6ghg	0	*	>Why even bother?  As per the OPs quote: they were given permission by the Obama administration. Trumps administration is all about reversing everything Obama did.
t1_dsutvyd	0	*	No, Republicans are doing a fine job repelling minorities and getting them to vote Democrat on their own, Democrats don't even need to make an argument to get their vote.   
t1_dsutoh1	1	*	Because if it weren't for a large exploitable labor force they'd be forced to meet market demands for pay?
t1_dsvfkr6	1	*	> He's managed to provide...  Trump didn't provide shit. You're absolutely delusional, like the rest of the obedient, unquestioning Trump followers.
t1_dsvc97t	1	*	>The article doesn't do too well of mentioning that this visa does not provide a pathway to citizenship.  Then change the law about birthright citizenship because that makes them ALL permanent. 
t1_dsunb17	1	*	Because it also gives ammo to his supporters that they are cracking down on visa overstay abuse.  His detractors already hate him.
t1_dsuzh3d	1	*	Most interestingly [Trump employs more Haitians than any other nationality](http://fortune.com/2018/01/12/donald-trump-haiti-mar-a-lago/) doing unskilled work at Mar-a-Lago.

t1_dsus58v	0	*	Sounds great, who pays though?
t1_dsusjqk	1	*	That's because they'll get sent back to their shithole country if they don't kiss ass constantly.  Captive labor.
t1_dsutg5z	1	*	Is it racist to the more than 80 counties on the list, or just the ones that fit your narrative?  
t1_dsuskff	1	*	More like the time that he was discovered to have denied leases to African Americans as a rule on his property.
t1_dsv4zk3	1	*	Whereas, the democratic party only sees others by their demographics, right?

t1_dsutyru	1	*	Roughly 100 came and a full 40% overstayed their visa. I'm sure some benifited but nearly half abused the system, ruining it for the rest of them. Of course, people won't focus on that statistic.

t1_dswztk4	0	*	so, you think its actually *worse*?
t1_dsvk0m9	1	*	I recommend reading the article.  
t1_dsv76zw	1	*	It says a lot about the US capacity to evaluate their leader and their capacity to blindly stick to their team/party no matter how stupid it goes.
t1_dsvj3sc	0	*	Yep, a complete coincidence that it went up 10,000 points during 1 year of his presidency when the previous 8 years it went up by ~4,000.
t1_dsvtekj	1	*	Pretty sure that stereotype only exists in the minds of other Americans...and in Hollywood. 
t1_dsvwmv1	1	*	In that they don't consider the Palestinians to be human and therefore without rights? Yeah, I guess you could make that argument.

t1_dsvbzk0	0	*	I may sound crass. But it is the truth and you know it.
t1_dsvi8uw	0	*	I would also say that Americans also embody innovation and scientific development.  Look at NASA and the space program.  The retired space shuttle is still seen as a symbol of space exploration.

t1_dt87s6q	0	*	And you're blind. The difference between me and you is that I'm actually willing to do something instead of just burying my head in the sand and pretending Capitalism still works.

t1_dt52zk2	0	*	The sub you're talking about, /r/The_Donald, is all about that catastrophic idiot. He did get elected to the office of the President of the United States though so it seems odd to call him an idiot.

t1_dskkyor	1	*	Its because weve tried being better than him (and continue to do so) and its done nothing. Doing the same thing and expecting a different result is pure insanity.

t1_dskgyg9	1	*	In private?  Should have no effect unless the left leak it to the press.
t1_dsk643s	1	*	Everyone also knows Trump wants to fuck his own daughter, but even if that's the truth you don't say it out loud. Although Trump has so... yea I forgot my point. 
t1_dskwox4	0	*	it is a shithole. but theres a big difference between random people saying it and the POTUS, the single most powerful man in the world, saying that about another sovereign nation.

t1_dskchaa	1	*	Meh I like the new way, call it like it is.
t1_dsk4i6k	0	*	Lol, that hardly warrants the shit hole comments.  Also calling them a shit hole wont exactly make them want to listen to our concerns, valid or not. 
t1_dskfqwx	1	*	agreed.  just because some folks are offended doesn't mean it's not true!
t1_dskks78	1	*	Yeah let's just take a picture of part of the country and obviously that represents the whole country!
t1_dsl099p	1	*	Or the guy could just tell the truth and tell them what a pathetic shithole of a nation Haiti is. 
t1_dskop3b	1	*	Which means they're literally exactly as responsible for the health of international relationships.
t1_dskp4mi	1	*	So he will say it was all a misunderstanding and Haiti is a perfectly not a shithole place and apologize?
t1_dskiw4o	0	*	Yup, hes already claiming he didnt say it
t1_dslirgh	1	*	The more aid we give them?  How high are you?  You could pour 100 Billion a year into Haiti and people will still be eating shit tainted mud cakes.
t1_dskfm00	1	*	> If Japan, China and many other countries arent taking in people from shithole countries, why should the US?  Look up what says on the Statue of Liberty, then get back to me, Mr Whataboutism.
t1_dsk5ctw	0	*	Yeah we have our own shitholes. Full of shitty commiecrats. We don't need to increase the numbers of lazy, disgusting, criminal, immoral, degenerate shithole makers.

t1_dth8yiv	1	*	Yeh, they think they can see the future.
t1_dtgg9fo	1	*	It was won on outright lies and frankly pathetic jingoism instead of policies.  Where winning was the only objective with no idea what winning would mean, and the damage it would do along the way.

t1_dtga1jm	0	*	What are they gaining from it?
t1_dtg4bf3	0	*	Except a bunch of people that were on your side are also switching sides given new information. You're leaving that part out.
t1_dtg3rjb	1	*	so just like the 2016 election.

t1_dtg5lod	0	*	There is this weird stigma against admitting fault and owning up to mistakes in OECD countries.  It is self-destructive and obnoxious.
t1_dtgaso1	1	*	Amen, brother. The cost of life is invaluable. Save the UK.  I stand with you. 
t1_dtg4w7n	1	*	Well the perks of democracy is that u get a say but a negative is if the majority is uninformed or educated u get brexit or what u see in turkey 
t1_dyd61fl	1	*	Still to soon? But just curious. Obama has 8 years to fix it. Ironic it comes after 6 months of being a lame duck. 
t1_dtg9rvw	1	*	And its not even being changed to the *same* blue. Its a different shade!

t1_dtfxazf	1	*	people that think things are obvious are much less motivated to vote than those that think that they are an oppressed minority 
t1_dtgb86w	1	*	I agree. I have found that governments are made of people, though. The same people with agendas found everywhere else in the world.
t1_dtgvigw	1	*	It's difficult to tell if your 'mildly' is sarcastic. This is really interesting. How do you know?

t1_dtgi7cm	1	*	Except referendums are not legally binding , as parliament is sovereign. 
t1_dtgapq8	1	*	people are still far too easily manipulated for that. democracy doesn't matter when you retards eat up every talking point from mega-newscorp #4.
t1_dtg4wmz	1	*	Wrong.  What we want is real leadership that isn't trying to sell us out to foreign interests or their own pocketbook.   Thank God for President Trump.  He won just in time to turn things around.

t1_dtg7853	1	*	Lol, you know what i meant, you cheeky bastard
t1_dth8gd0	0	*	So you're a sheep who can't think for yourself! remember when your experts told you Hillary would win? Appealing to authority is a helluva drug.
t1_dtg7i7c	1	*	Problem is that benevolent dictatorship is orders more effective than uninformed democracy, and with the current complexity of the world probably more than even informed democracy.
t1_dtg69y9	1	*	Uhh, I hate to tell you this but that vote was one of the highest turnouts in history if I remember correctly.
t1_dtgkjjj	1	*	Ahh yes it was just brown people. 
t1_dtgblvz	0	*	Amazing. Almost every word of what you just said was wrong. 
t1_dtgoih7	1	*	Yes getting rid of those silly import tariffs will surely help your export. 
t1_dtg1th4	1	*	The Remain campaign repeatedly warned that the result would be carried out. As did the government, who posted a leaflet through everyone's door saying as much.
t1_dtg7gzw	1	*	It's healthy, I saw it on a bus!
t1_dtg1tc1	0	*	It was like a coupe hundred people who did that, millions voted. Not something that'd change what happened.

t1_dtg89nm	1	*	[Richard Dawkins has a great commentary on this](https://youtu.be/pe4feBH0ABk). His tie alone is worth the watch. 
t1_dth0m2e	1	*	Well he wasnt the government so isnt able to make a promise.   Also it was a suggestion for the money could be used for. The ultimate decision is up to the government in power at the time. 
t1_dtgkl4s	1	*	Having to apply for about 15 work permits was such a pain in the arse
t1_dtg8lxr	1	*	Brexit vote came 1st
t1_dtg6p81	1	*	2018-1975=43  43+21=64 (not 61)  43+30=73  Your math is wrong on two levels (first you have a 9 year spread, 30-21, then you have a 12 year spread, 73-61, as if people aged at different rates).
t1_dtg1jdt	1	*	Idiots!
t1_dtg3tny	0	*	Glad you speak for all 63 million people that voted for him..
t1_dtg59qg	1	*	America and the motherland learned that lesson something bad this past year
t1_dtgcnxu	1	*	Haven't heard about this. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
t1_dtgcdlw	1	*	Trump lul
t1_dtgqf4q	1	*	Exactly. At this stage if you vote Tory you are either a fucking idiot or a reprehensible piece of shit. Possibly both. I'm not saying labour are the answer but *ANYONE* but the Tories.
t1_dtg0fm2	1	*	Yup. I'm not British but I know four people that are and none of them voted. All of them regret it.
t1_dtg51uo	1	*	Ignorance mostly 
t1_dtgqhqj	1	*	Not just brown people, they hate Poles too.

t1_dtg01a3	0	*	Because those couple people losing their careers are greedy gobshites.
t1_dtgbyet	1	*	Because Brexit means red white & blue Brexit! That's the shit we're dealing with...
t1_dtg4dv7	1	*	Maybe people in England are fans of not being told what to do by Europe, it hasn't ever been good for them, especially the last decade.
t1_dtgflyf	1	*	Yes, that is why you find Apple there. But i believe they have some critism about it due to the fact they are part of EU. But what will Britains ace in the sleeve be?
t1_dtgf0hn	1	*	Seriously, when all polls show that it would be close, why would you risk not voting? If you didn't vote because you thought stay was going to win by a landslide, then you can only blame yourself.
t1_dtg6kmu	1	*	Hey now! Leavers are NOT racist! Fucking over all the brown people is just a happy coincidence....
t1_dthg1k2	1	*	> five minutes  This is all you need to change their minds.
t1_dtg9cb7	0	*	A country ceases to be a democracy when a democratic vote is overturned

t1_dtm2tpv	0	*	What do you look forward to?      (I'm asking because I'm 31 and the only thing I look forward to is one day dying)
t1_dtm2g19	1	*	Perhaps.  I know some elderly people that basically lost their will to live and degraded quickly when their partner died.

t1_dtuebvo	1	*	Sorry?
t1_dttolfy	1	*	You are so right 
t1_dttvk9h	1	*	But this company is based in Taiwan and has nothing to do with the US. 
t1_dtu21n8	1	*	Thanks for pointing that out. Missed that. But I guess the US still does a ton of trade with Vietnam. I wonder what that first post war trade meeting looked like..
t1_dttnz0z	1	*	Not really what?  I'm just pointing out it's a Taiwanese company.
t1_dtton11	0	*	And the worst part is that that should be perfectly fine. Automation should be a boon for the workforce, not the owners.

t1_dtk70zv	1	*	Well that didnt take long 
t1_dtk8ldl	0	*	In many countries there are laws against frivolous lawsuits or lawsuits designed to achieve another end than justice or reparations.  Hopefully NZ has these types of law too. 
t1_dtk38ho	0	*	They should be fine to visit Palestine though
t1_dtkjeoh	1	*	But they can at worst expect a fine if they ever go to Israel. That's pretty terrible intimidation compared to the negative PR they recieve instead. I fail to see any good reasons of doing that.

t1_dug6gpm	1	*	What a feminist shithole. I prefer /r/Egalitarianism 
t1_duf5pix	1	*	This is a deceptive argument.  I don't care if FGM is MORE barbaric than male circumcision.  They're both barbaric.  Just leave the kids alone.  Stop cutting baby dicks! 
t1_dufga17	0	*	OK, then.  People had the right to mutilate little baby boys in Iceland. Soon, they won't have that right any more. What's the problem?

t1_duf6rvz	0	*	Yes it can be like comparing cutting a finger off to cutting an arm off.    The point is though that both are rather disgusting practises and should be viewed as such. 
t1_dug6fa4	0	*	Do you see the picture and all that blood? That's feminism.
t1_dufibwk	1	*	> How a person who could assault their baby's sex organs can even be considered a fit parent is beyond me.  This is worse than mere assault -- this is permanent damage.

t1_dsa27bh	1	*	Well them I guess they should die then. If the argument is the animals had to die to prove the authenticity of the experiment, then so do the human contestants.

t1_ds9p9pl	1	*	So what's the difference between that and for example a show where they go out to catch their own food and cook it ? Seems like a weird boundary 
t1_dsa9861	1	*	It's not whataboutism to want you to hold everyone to the same standards as you do one person. This is a cop out answer at best.
t1_ds9y2pf	0	*	Bear Grylls could handle a real survival situation just fine. He would just do the opposite of whatever he does on his show.  If someone followed the advice from his show, they'd be dead.

t1_ds9zwun	1	*	Just be careful not to look too much like a deer, or you might be killed and eaten by contestants on a Bear Grylls survival show
t1_dsa1poj	1	*	Agreed, but it's of course a little ridiculous when you literally show hunting and butchering on telly. Better just leave the commend away altogether.
t1_dsa1unc	0	*	> Never heard of Ray Mears! If he's anything like Les Stroud, I'll check him out.  Les Stroud is a class clown, Ray Mears is a kind and intelligent teacher.
t1_dsa77gt	1	*	You need to mention this when someone asks you if you want some raw water. 
t1_ds9sxtk	1	*	Plus the objective was not survival, but entertainment. 
t1_ds9uu2q	0	*	Right but why would the production team hunt down wild cayman and chicken when they can just buy them from a farm?

t1_duyzvzc	0	*	I'm 54. Hardly anything was in plastic when I was a kid. I include candy bars, chips, cereal, you name it. 
t1_duyw7wq	1	*	No. It was Whole Foods.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whole-foods-responds-to-6-pre-peeled-orange-twitterstorm/
t1_duyvetw	1	*	Or produce aisles.
t1_duysbij	1	*	Still calling bullshit.
t1_duyuq6k	1	*	Many cans have plastic linings, even when you wouldn't expect it.
t1_duyvwoa	0	*	Why is that?  Food costs a lot more to produce and inflicts a lot more environmental damage than do plastic bags to contain said food. 
t1_duyqaad	1	*	I'd say it qualifies as a supermarket but the whole thing isn't plastic free, only one isle.
t1_duzc7r5	1	*	like I said, While I fully support that, there's a reason the world transitioned to plastic
t1_dsybfjx	1	*	Thats what I was sort of thinking as well. Were still progressing and a decent bit away from full electric vehicles being widely adopted. Planes would be immensely more challenging.

t1_duq5syc	1	*	My condolences
t1_duqzvfv	1	*	When Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th avenue and not lose a voter, I thought he was crazy.  It turns out that characterization of his voters may be one of the most accurate things he's said.

t1_durkibo	1	*	Tasteless. Classless. Trumplike.
t1_dur68b7	1	*	Honestly, I think it's not been as great a drop in respect as American's think. It's not like the USA has had much respect for over a decade now.
t1_durflvc	1	*	congress has to enforce the laws.Party > Country when it comes to republicans.
t1_duqeyhd	1	*	They would have literally burned her.
t1_dur308x	1	*	This comment is hilarious and accurate.
t1_durbevd	1	*	The Trumps would never behave unethically for financial gain though.
t1_duqfxwq	0	*	I'm not.   Let's leave politics to the usual hack-fraud politicians for now on, so we can continue our descent into nothingness a lot more slowly. 
t1_dur6yzm	1	*	Even William Henry Harrison had more capability and brains than Donald Trump. And he died a month after he became President. 
t1_dur99vt	0	*	I love how many celebrities and Americans said they would move if Trump got elected... they are still here.
t1_duqzboi	0	*	only a few more years until Yeezy2020 :)  maybe 2024 someone like Sylvester Stallone can win? Wouldn't that be great?
t1_dur4cl6	1	*	You have got a knack for comedy writing

t1_duqxwvr	0	*	*in a disrespectful tone
t1_dur5jx4	1	*	It's not like democrats are allowing this. Republicans are. Therefore exposing republican hypocrisy is valid
t1_durthzx	1	*	My bad!

t1_du4uawv	1	*	Ah yes, the Metal Gear Solid way of explaining things.
t1_du681l3	1	*	Turkey locks people up and kicks them out of the financial system if they don't like what you have to say.  It might not be Saudi Arabia but its got its own authoritarian problems no doubt.
t1_du5mqg8	1	*	Stop sharing Daily Sabah, it's owned by an Erdogan Crony and pushes stupid nationalist BS. It's only useful feature is it reflects what the Erdogan Buerocracy wants to push unto people.
t1_dt7ucac	0	*	Exactly, which is why the infamous 'snooper's charter' is her baby. Anyway, she seems to be a dead woman walking, thank goodness - as long as that toxic oaf Boris doesn't become PM.

t1_dsuy362	0	*	The tax cuts his businesses and his kids get are worth 10s of millions. You think hed give 2 shits about a $400k traditional salary? 
t1_dsuxhq0	0	*	No, theyll say they knew all along it wouldnt be a real wall across the entire border and Trump is playing 6D triple space checkers. 
t1_dt1uxn5	1	*	It's not what hea meant excuse, it was actual live interview and those were the answers. So the guy clarified his own statements as news was spinning it out of control.
t1_dsvcjlq	1	*	Nope. They will probably now start arguing that a wall would be too costly and pointless, so Trump is a genius for deciding against it. So basically what everyone else was saying the entire time.
t1_dsuqiws	0	*	The Muslim ban is also pretty ridiculous, even the partial symbolic one
t1_dsvhr9p	0	*	Wouldn't having kids make you not support the tax bill? It blows a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit that they're gonna have to pay for.

t1_dsvdnez	1	*	Great, now I'm even more disappointed in humanity. You're probably correct too...
t1_dsvq8n0	0	*	I think the commenter may have meant that Kelly would be out of a job soon - because Trump can't handle real talk and would rather prefer yes-men.

t1_dsu2ert	1	*	I don't think he will. He has lost all of his influence in the last few months and has no job. I think he will try and use this as a opportunity to prove...... something.

t1_dsta88y	0	*	It's easy to get a Democrat elected down here when he is running against a kiddy diddler
t1_dst8h0p	0	*	While under oath, no less. I suspect that's why Flynn was charged with lying to the FBI. It sends a message that testimony needs to be truthful or there will be consequences.
t1_dspixgo	1	*	That would seem to be the case.  Predators use the same sort of nonsense to justify what they are doing.  
t1_dspiy6p	1	*	I see.  You can read the minds of everyone reading reddit and can speak for them.  And how does that make you feel?
t1_dspims1	1	*	No She's/he's not. Go somewhere with your holier than thou mentality and condescension.  Jackass.

t1_dsz7xsw	1	*	In economy of selling weapons, yes.  War crimes are something else. He is responsible and he is avoiding this. Russian will have no problem handing him over once the contract ends.

t1_dtxu8p1	1	*	Early on in the start, various independant reporters criticised Turkey from allowing people to take parts of the border down, it was also filmed. They were complacent.
t1_dtyftx6	1	*	Agree. Once youd cross the line into scummery, debating who is the scummier scum is a waste of good slime 
t1_dtz6thh	0	*	How every leader saying Assad must go have been the ones forced out of power. Meanwhile there are massive displays of support for Assad and hed win a free election easily 
t1_dtyk0zd	1	*	Don't forget the ones that Erdogan bombed!
t1_dtyevtw	1	*	Yet 
t1_dtyelgu	1	*	Nah, erdogan is bragging about the fact that he has more control over his country with less killings. He's just better at tyranny.

t1_dtb9wpl	0	*	I actually think it's really sad. That city will have a really bad time when water runs out
t1_dt65gc8	0	*	That's not really what slander is. To be slanderous a statement must be untrue. How, exactly, does one show evidence that a religious figure molested him years or decades ago?
t1_dtnuq30	1	*	Latin America is a bastion of technology and patents?
t1_dtmkayv	1	*	It's not wise to publish the findings from high tech military testing. I assure you that there is a massive amount of data from these tests that shows them where things went wrong.
t1_dv43dqb	0	*	I think both are idiots, just for different reasons. 
t1_dv495m6	1	*	Not yet. July 1 is when its slated to become legal

t1_dsluuv1	1	*	Jesus, just when I thought things were bad, someone points out that it's actually worse.
t1_dsm48jg	1	*	I know that, I know Haiti hasnt exactly had a fair shake of the dice historically. Its still one of the worlds worst shitholes regardless. 
t1_ds3mo9x	0	*	I guess they think immigrants are the culprits. 
t1_ds3pnvk	0	*	Those wealthy people are the ones who really own the country anyway so what does it matter?

t1_dswp87v	1	*	And crowded.
t1_dswsnr7	0	*	Just don't accidentally say anything against the ruling family,  being from Russia your likely used to keeping your mouth shut already, 
t1_dueo6ea	0	*	Letting them plow right up to the base like that did not help. If the tree was valuable why didn't someone consult an arborist ?
t1_dskmuf3	1	*	My bad. Didn't watch the video. My decision making skills are lacking before my second coffee. Sorry folks.
t1_dszzx46	0	*	happy cake day

t1_dt4zfyx	0	*	Just an update: He was safe.  He ended up hiding on his balcony all night.  The gunman smashed down every room and searched the rooms. Thank you for your help.  
t1_dszfqqk	1	*	Asking people on /r/worldnews to actually read the news, or even asking people on reddit to think rationally, is like asking a fish to fly
t1_dszr2dn	1	*	They've been at war for almost forty years. More than a generation who knows no other way. 
t1_dszacvv	1	*	there's always hope 
t1_dubgvsz	0	*	No, if it quacks like a duck, its a russian in disguise.
t1_dtu7opf	1	*	It's simply collective punishment and a threat of committing mass terrorism. There is no argument out of that fact. 
t1_dst53ub	1	*	Degrees aren't necessary in IT. Though being qualified definitely is.
t1_dst37fp	0	*	Your sentences are quite incoherent. Plagiarism is not allowed within academia. I was shocked that people actually do this, i thought about becoming one of those essay writers for a while.  
t1_dsta5ni	0	*	Come on lads not in front of The American
t1_dss2oc9	1	*	The people who haven't attended university won't know the difference. The people who have will look it up on Google. 
t1_dssxm2g	1	*	No, it's just manipulative charming people, favouritism where their superiors look the other way, ass kissing and old boys club.
t1_dsrjdg0	1	*	These people are probably from Pakistan.
t1_dsrqguy	1	*	> Harvard Business School   It's a highly prestigious MBA. It will at least make your CV seriously stand out over the rest.
t1_dtmtoym	1	*	At least some countries have laws against this. In Ontario, Canada for example, all universities have to be government approved.
t1_dt7bt5u	1	*	That attitude isn't helping anything. You're just as bad as the kids over at t_d.
t1_dt81tf0	1	*	They know people won't care/click on a story only about ISS funding.

t1_dt8ater	0	*	Well, seeing as it cost $150 billion, I don't imagine they could afford it...
t1_dt80r2m	0	*	Something can be correct and still be propaganda.  Presentation matters a lot. In this respect, presentation matters even more than the actual facts being reported.
t1_dt88865	1	*	Opportunity landed just a few weeks later and it's still going.
t1_dt8ckqp	0	*	The verge knows what it's doing with that title
t1_dt8ocoi	1	*	Spirit doesn't have to safely protect human beings from the ravages of radiation and vacuum.
t1_dsn8jrq	1	*	I dont know exactly how it works, but this aint it.  Sellers of real estate arent responsible for criticizing or evaluating in some other way where the buyers money came from.  
t1_dsmgq4g	1	*	At least Trump is not their president.
t1_dso4mnx	1	*	It is this way before the 2016 elections.

t1_dsmew06	0	*	I was wondering how such a collosal moron could build a $1b business. Guess I know the answer now - money laundering 
t1_dsmgdn6	0	*	Have you ever been to the States? Or is your only interaction with people from the states, on Reddit and the comment section of RT? Thats been the narrative over there for a while.
t1_dsmj5qp	0	*	It has to be pretty fucking bad to be banned from r/politics. I'd call Breitbart 'soft banned', since any post from that source will never see the light of day.
t1_dsme4f1	0	*	The power of a NDA. 
t1_dsmds7f	1	*	Trump was talking about immigration, so I think he was talking about the people themselves

t1_dsmftl2	1	*	They have a legitimate news department, it's not just all tasty videos and YouTube manspreading.
t1_dsmdscl	1	*	It's the sellers responsibility to make sure the buyer's finances are straight? I thought it was the mortgage company that making the loan.  
t1_dsmgm53	1	*	Blame Rudy and his tightness with NYFO FBI. Shady shit has gone down there.
t1_dsmik1e	1	*	its like trump's properties is the hub for all shitty people in the world to hide their money. take him down.
t1_dsmdram	1	*	The thing is, I don't know if he considers it blackmail. More like the cost of doing business. 
t1_dsmhpyj	1	*	Because they're mostly white, obviously.    /s
t1_dsmc5sq	0	*	First off, Hillary isn't the president. Additionally, one news story doesn't negate another.
t1_dsmfhga	1	*	You're seriously going to believe the words of a fucking **dictator**? Did you believe everything Saddam Hussein said too?
t1_dsmczq8	0	*	Nothing can be trusted = Putinism
t1_dsmfvxv	0	*	I think you got your timeline mixed up...
t1_dsn5mmr	1	*	It was his comment that was cancer.
t1_dsmfdpy	1	*	How is it Trump's job to check if your money is legal or not? That's the job of the IRS 
t1_dsmfuhl	1	*	Buzzfeed has some good investigative journalism mixed in with all the clickbait crap.
t1_dsmcr5r	0	*	The porn star thing came from The Wall Street Journal. Is Rupert Murdoch the liberal media now?
t1_dsmilzp	0	*	Since news broke that Wilsons unwitting heir, President Trump, called Haiti  along with El Salvador and seemingly all 54 nations in Africa  shithole countries,  straight from Washington post
t1_dsntf8u	1	*	If the Repugnant Republican party is even allowed to continue existing and is not forced to disband, that is.
t1_dsmgqrz	0	*	Do you have  dementia? All we heard for 8 years of Obama was Bush this and Bush that. Gtfo with your delusions.
t1_dsme4uc	1	*	> decent investigative journalism  This isn't a good example. There is only unverifiable (and unverified by the writer) hearsay.
t1_dsme1ap	1	*	why not just bitcoin? 
t1_dsngdk1	1	*	Possibly. Dec 1990 to June 1991 is 6-7 months.
t1_dsn0sgd	1	*	I don't know definitively, but as of now nothing has been presented.   But absence of evidence is not evidence of absence  
t1_dtidsj7	0	*	We all know the French officials are, in general, anti-semites.

t1_dtrhu8y	1	*	Congress was paid well for that.
t1_duzm9nm	1	*	It doesn't matter how much encryption you have if you let yourself get phished.
t1_dspjvqc	1	*	Yeah, no. In 2012, most of Europe and EU still hoped for a friendly neighbor. The level of sanctions on Russia at that point was sometimes it took an unreasonably long time to get a visa to the UK.
t1_dsos69u	0	*	Nobody forced all the Eastern European countries to join NATO.   Why do you think NATO is strongly popular in former Soviet controlled countries, Vlad?
t1_dsorhhs	1	*	that's not going to happen, what they did was devastating a political nuke, that and their invasive behaviour. sanction on there upper class works best but w.e
t1_dsotm14	1	*	And Crimea had been wanting to be part of Russia since the USSR broke down. 
t1_dso7hs8	1	*	This makes zero sense. 
t1_dsoglm9	1	*	He won't. He's your typical Reddit armchair general.
t1_dspkz86	1	*	unfair? wtf? who talks about fairness here? it's a punishment. it's not really fair to annex foreign territory as well...
t1_dsodjov	0	*	I dont know, Ill take my lesson from history, when the USSR basically collapsed due to economic problems and civil disturbance from the people.
t1_dsp29lz	0	*	so who's running Crimea? americans or russians. who cares about what UN says. 
t1_dspl7qg	1	*	oh well. that's bad news for russia then, i guess.
t1_dsxjeyr	1	*	Wow U0001f954U0001f3b6
t1_dsghxz2	0	*	Perhaps it is wrong to kill sentient beings for the fun of it.
t1_dsfl9m3	1	*	What goes grizzly have to do with that? Nothing. 
t1_dv2bgt2	1	*	> Yeah, fuck the human race!  Pretty much, I mean we'd rather just argue than save ourselves, that's about as close to deserving it as you can get. 
t1_dv1nnrr	1	*	My link was my proposal. Nuclear.   Edit: :)
t1_dv2bd9y	1	*	not if you are denying climate change you're not! Hah, got you there! 
t1_dv1m9f9	1	*	unsightly compared to what?   I'd much rather look at that than a coal plant.
t1_dv16fie	0	*	No, another option would be to use excess power to pump water uphill. Electrical storage as potential energy in water.
t1_dv2g9af	1	*	The necessary modern technology to achieve this requires enough battery storage to balance the load for a day according to the study. 
t1_dt7p1sy	1	*	Second. Hoffer should be required reading these days.
t1_dt81xzi	1	*	Yeah, but that was before 9/11.  Don't look for consistency in the philosophy of bigots.

t1_dta3d1f	1	*	you sir... are correct
t1_dt8egql	1	*	And you'll see reports of new  desalination plants. Punt the problem down the line.
t1_dt8eruk	0	*	Yeah Lake Mead provides water for parts of 3 different states I believe. If that runs out that's a huge region that's  fucked.
t1_du8914k	0	*	No they let the AI do the boring stuff. lol.
t1_dugb2q2	1	*	Broom is a verb.

t1_dufzv3d	1	*	Well... Can't argue with you on that one
t1_dugckpk	0	*	Curling is a sport one can play while drinking beer, casually played anyways.  Kind of like 3 pitch softball or darts, or Jenga.

t1_duecy5z	0	*	Depends how you define recent, else you could say: South Korea, Japan and Germany
t1_due9fy1	1	*	Russia is not the USSR and quantifying how much of a force for good or evil a specific country is or has been is generally futile outside extreme cases.
t1_duefy7s	1	*	I don't think you learned anything
t1_dug71rh	1	*	Who exactly are you arguing with? 
t1_dugcdqm	1	*	I think most Americans would approve of straight up nuking somebody if it got them a discount on something.
t1_duf5o8p	0	*	Protip, Americans aren't the only ones who reddit.  And there are lots of people defending America. Vigorously.
t1_duerdr7	1	*	No one can meddle with the elections of the Glorious Leader of Russia, Vladimir The Bare-Chested. No one!  Thats unpossible. 
t1_dueerax	0	*	I stand corrected on the figure.... but the next highest was only 17.2%.  Still not a close race, and clearly not fair on it's face.  My point stands.
t1_dufdgq1	1	*	Considering Americans supported the Iraq War for no discernible reason at all (Bush won his reelection with more votes than his first election), I doubt they wouldn't have chosen cheap bananas.
t1_duf2x1x	1	*	This OP account is mod of a network of over 100 subs. lol

t1_duxrh46	0	*	No it isn't.  China is a regional power.
t1_duxhgsx	0	*	China would be one of them.  I recently moved to Shanghai and, I for one welcome our new Chinese overlords.

t1_dt3knhk	1	*	Yeah I was moderately active when I was like 19 (2009). It just got me in a bunch of trouble with girls I was talking to. And now my moms on it.
t1_dt417h6	1	*	Everything has its pros and cons.
t1_dt3bh9q	1	*	Of course society isn't good. Nothing is pure good.  Society, as with most things, is both benevolent *AND* malevolent.

t1_ds8krgn	1	*	The fuck did you make that shit up from.
t1_dtqpb3n	0	*	What does that have to do with anything?
t1_duqx1cp	1	*	Or maybe they just liked being on a team together and will miss each other and don't like the border between them. Christ, you're edgy.

t1_dtkdsb9	1	*	If it's really that severe there's going to be a whole lot of overseas travel going on. Not to mention smuggling. 
t1_dtkkavg	1	*	Me too. I'd hate to see this come out and be unattainable to certain people because of income/ insurance coverage. This is really awesome news. 
t1_dtk8ttk	1	*	85% similarity of our genomes; we share 98% of DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos! Also, the structure of the mices nervous system are very similar.

t1_dtkqzz0	1	*	Does this mean that if we were running as many tests on humans as we are mice, wed have really good treatments?

t1_dtk9w16	1	*	Because this is a paper about year(s) of work. The next paper will, most likely, also take a while.   Science doesn't really care about time, sadly. It goes at its own pace.

t1_dtk7hhv	1	*	That's actually the origin of the name. Like, I read it on reddit. It's even [in the site's wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_does_the_name_.22reddit.22_mean.3F).

t1_dtkjp7q	1	*	Thank you :)
t1_dtkmlal	1	*	So that's where the word similar came from, since 100% isn't very ambiguous as OP worded it. Thanks!
t1_dtkilzl	0	*	The manufacturing wouldnt be the expensive part. Its the research that needs to be paid for.
t1_dtkmog0	1	*	I mean, I think acoustic cells would be cool. 
t1_dtk7xdo	1	*	It can't come soon enough. Our Monkey has a lymphoma right now. 
t1_dtk8luu	1	*	Have you not seen. I am legend !
t1_dtk75oy	1	*	I hope things get better for you and your wife. 
t1_dtksq7t	0	*	Because the FDA is in the pharma lobbists pockets, who will make sure it doesn't get approved for the public to use.
t1_dtk8mi8	1	*	It's a long way from mice to humans. 
t1_dtk9q3p	1	*	There is more profits in treatment, less in cures 
t1_dtk7zjb	1	*	I just got my first ever pet mouse, it's crazy how much personality these little guys have.
t1_dtk8a2h	1	*	Thats very good for the rat community, please dont put it in the human newspaper
t1_dtkche9	0	*	You know this possible breakthrough sounds so fantastic I'm glad this wasn't posted on April 1st. It's so good it's hard to believe.

t1_dtk9guj	1	*	Media loves it so seizes on journal articles and makes nonsense statements about sensible science, is my guess.
t1_dtk7o0i	0	*	I just ignore those kind of people. I think most of us do.
t1_dtk89d9	1	*	It sounds like the problems are environmental and not related to a cure for cancer. If cancer IS cured sure there may be a pop boom but these sources indicate it is a dramatic problem either way.
t1_dtkz89k	1	*	This one is a little different. Lots of the other things we've heard about are discoveries of possibilities. This is the first I've heard that's been actually tested and is not hypothetical 
t1_dtkbx5q	1	*	I decided to read the article in spite of your comment and it was just as boring as I had expected it to be. Sorry if I've disappointed you with the lack of citations.
t1_dtkg3xh	0	*	What would be a reasonable amount to pay for a mouse's cancer cure, though? I suspect it would be an awful lot to pay for a mouse.
t1_dtkd6si	0	*	Cancers certainly can adapt. As they spread they display Darwinian evolution, so the 'same' tumour in different places will have different genetics, based on whatever environment it needs to grow in. 
t1_dtk7psg	0	*	Takes years. Just because this happens doesnt mean cancer will be cured the next week
t1_dtk8zro	1	*	Well specifically *viral* treatments of cancer. 
t1_dtkjyia	1	*	Theres no money in a cure. Theres a lot more of money in the treatments though. 
t1_dujcl8a	1	*	it's called [fundamental attribution error theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), and it's basically a good explanation for why people are self centered jerks. 
t1_dumklta	1	*	Airport security is intense, but it's not IDF. One of the requirements for the job is that they served in combat roles (infantry, etc). They have a separate 7 week training course.
t1_dumflym	1	*	You're right they should have let them down the UAE flight.

t1_dumt3aj	0	*	I know really? He is obviously bias, Israel is worst country on earth! My father tell me since day I was born!
t1_dumejml	1	*	Weirdly enough, majority of palestinians support terrorism. Survey you quoted had words saying relocation and survey 2 had words saying suicide bombing
t1_duo9pv9	1	*	I'm sorry, what fucking account is supposed to have a fucking crypto address-esque username that only was made 18hrs ago?    Spijon?
t1_dt5fa0q	1	*	This assumes that's most Canadian industries are manufacturing and that labour costs are the largest concerns.  They aren't and they aren't.
t1_dt5l6ca	1	*	I like this idea

t1_dt54x3r	0	*	Oil is bought and sold on the international market. 
t1_dt5p442	1	*	Bernie is a protectionist under different set of policies.  Hillary opposed it solely b/c political pressure.  TPP was economically a positive and strategically a huge positive.... 
t1_dt5ccji	0	*	Soon enough the US won't be Canada's only customer for oil. That's a much bigger deal. 
t1_dt5g3vi	1	*	Good thing developed countries have long been shifting towards service economies and not manufacturing based ones
t1_dt57i9g	1	*	They probably will be at some point.
t1_dt6peln	1	*	Not when it fucked up chobani yogurts. How great was a country when it cant even come up with a reliable supply of basic staples like milk?
t1_dt4vm4d	0	*	Bell and the fam still want to fuck net neutrality here too though don't worry
t1_dt5ll5t	1	*	Moderates of both parties supported it. It's the extreme left and Trump's morons that oppose it. Are you in support of eliminating NAFTA too?
t1_dt5a5gq	1	*	Monetarily the TPP went from the size of our solar system to Pluto in this agreement. This isn't worldnews it should be Sponsored Headlines.    BEGONE!!
t1_dt55yiz	1	*	After 2016 elections, not weird at all. Just have to look closely.

t1_dt678rf	0	*	You're a stupid fucking Canadian too. 
t1_dt5ct1p	1	*	I have read several articles on the changes and have read up to 20 provisions the US pushed for were suspended. I will reserve final judgement for when the text is released.
t1_dt55dge	1	*	Its* yo
t1_dt4pt3n	0	*	You realize the 1920's and 2018 there is quite a bit of difference in everything in the world, right? I'm tired of everybody dropping this great depression line.
t1_dt5nhf4	1	*	When you can give the pussy grabbing quote a citation of The President of The United States, it's a bit of a stretch to call the office respectable at that point.
t1_dt5h7p9	1	*	Goal is to also posture interntonally/economically outside of America China and India.   Quality proposition for a traditional middle power like Canada.   As I Canadian I am cautiously optimistic. 
t1_dt5846y	1	*	Russia benefits from the discord.

t1_dt5il6p	1	*	Nice wall we got 
t1_dt5haxa	1	*	I did in another response. 
t1_dt5igpl	1	*	Ya US will Agree to NAFTA, and China and Canada will ink a free trade deal. 
t1_dt50ikf	1	*	I've been for TPP since the beginning. Sorry that reddit doesn't understand international politics and would prefer to go to war with North Korea.

t1_dt5cu1x	1	*	I think Trump's a garbage President but I'm not a partisan hack. I totally support him pulling us out of the TPP.
t1_dt56o50	1	*	gonna get left behind
t1_dt57sfj	1	*	I think that's exactly what happened.
t1_dt5835g	0	*	You fail to mention that in the USA, if you arent part of the top 1% everything is a bad deal.
t1_dt5dvwb	0	*	> way it is being presented.  Dont believe anything until the text is released.
t1_dt4yhz6	0	*	Massively dishonest comment. The TPP today is different to what it used to be. Namely, the ridiculous IP sections that everyone hated are gone.
t1_dt5oaz7	1	*	> if america is not important, then why is the US called out in the headline?  Because it is an American news source? CBS? 
t1_dt4ovr4	1	*	Yeah, but the TPP of today is actually pretty different from the TPP from yesteryear. The parts of it that Reddit hated so much aren't even in it anymore, for one thing.
t1_dt4pk7f	0	*	Many of the reasons people opposed the TPP have been stripped from this version of the agreement from what I understand. 
t1_dt51zx0	1	*	it hurts them more.  their debt issues are scary  they keep fucking with the currency they could collapse the whole global economy.
t1_dt6ai28	1	*	Yeah except there is also a provision for the US to change their mind and join in later on and all the things they wanted would just be slipped in there and forced on everyone with no choice.   
t1_dt573fc	1	*	You ok dude?
t1_dt64glq	1	*	Again, you are missing the fact that the agreement includes countries like Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, etc.
t1_dt5csqz	0	*	That wall sure looks beautiful and Clinton is rotting in prison right?
t1_dt5acpw	1	*	But it is.

t1_du4pqhz	1	*	Eh that valuation was probably off since the property was then flipped for an $18 million profit.
t1_du4ufcf	0	*	Yes, it probably is. The point I am making is that you KNOW people and the media will try to paint this as Russian election shennenigans.

t1_du4jyhb	0	*	You could be absolutely right, but given the context, it's easy to see why it warrants a closer look.  Edit: thanks for the downvote whoever, it's amazing how fragile his supporters can be. 
t1_du4lri8	0	*	Well yeah this is almost certainly a case of money laundering.
t1_du4o0tt	1	*	It's sad. I remember reading Newsweek  years ago, and I remember that the articles were lengthy and in-depth. Then they got sold off, and now they're crap.

t1_dv12lnx	1	*	It's basically someone who unironically believes that Stalin did nothing wrong.
t1_dt5ckhz	0	*	My biggest fear is that the Socialists will lose power in a regular election.  Propaganda has been fueling strife with the government and it's not feasible for capitalists to take hold.  
t1_dts26dx	1	*	Or when they get armed by foreign nations with their own interests and the start a shitstorm that doesnt show signs of ending.

t1_du3bb3j	0	*	Tbh, I did find it odd that she came out saying something to the effect of, we didn't all know. It just reminded me of what a naive, sheltered individual would say when sensing the heat coming.
t1_du3ze4q	1	*	I agree:  South Korea follows extremely intricate social customs. 
t1_du3sii0	0	*	Big fan, eh?  It was just *regular* assault, for the record of anyone else here. I guess that's somehow better.

t1_dtqypzm	0	*	That's when you tell people to skip a day or take 2 minute showers instead of 10 minute showers. Don't do laundry as often. Yellow let it mellow, brown flush it down.
t1_dv44hgy	1	*	Don't worry, we'll only use upstanding and well respected investigators. however to protect the investigations we'll have to keep their identities secret.
t1_dv54y0c	1	*	This doesn't mean you should authorise religious schools. It means you should fix the public schools in your region/country.

t1_dtln6kt	1	*	Found Hitler's account
t1_dtmejiy	1	*	Probably wouldn't be hard.  When you kill something you gain it's soul, so killing a poacher gets you multiple souls!
t1_ds8iq75	0	*	Why would whether or not Americans are watching be relevant to the investigation? It's happening regardless of whether we see it, and at this point I think the feds are out for blood.

t1_dtwi7yc	0	*	they supported allowing the suing of the saudi government by victims of 9/11 basically unanimously right? I remember Schumer being the only person to vote against it. 
t1_dtx8awo	0	*	Isn't impeachment literally made so if a president isn't doing their job, they can be removed?

t1_dtvz3d8	1	*	Yeah, I'm not sure what else we would do. Sure, maybe sanctions, but I don't think that would discourage them.

t1_dshpo13	1	*	In fact: if Russia really had interfere towards referendum there would have been independence, not just a couple of people yelling and cop violence.
t1_dshoj3o	1	*	It's actually closer to 40.  But we don't talk about that, now do we?  Media would never publish that! lol    
t1_dshkovd	0	*	Literally same criticism of RT when it cites things
t1_dshr16h	1	*	Guys who invited George Bush to this sub?  
t1_dsi0ufq	1	*	That's all I see but I would love to be wrong. 
t1_dsifoug	1	*	Da, we have elections. All candidate mysteriously disappear, turn up in jails or kill themselves. What a strange world. We have no choice but to choose Putin for the third time.
t1_dshshjp	1	*	Took a sweet look the world map my friend.  Explain me why there are 0 Russian military bases around the US but 20 US bases at the border of Russia.  Who wants to have war ? Hypocrisy.
t1_dshxdns	1	*	Join us over here in the US. Sure Putin pulled a few tricks, but really it was our collective idiocy that elected Trump. 
t1_dshrf7z	1	*	I just think its hypocritical how much time is spent talking about big bad Russia when the US is really the biggest bully in the world 
t1_dshprs1	1	*	This guy knows how politics work
t1_dshdxd0	1	*	Nice one 
t1_dshtww5	1	*	Well the list says they already got to France...
t1_dsi0gn5	1	*	That's Guatemala which is not in South America. Anyway almost every country in actual South America had a coup and dictatorship backed by the CIA. 
t1_dshu7yb	1	*	Your point?   And FYI, Nazis were not socialists. 
t1_dsht6xj	1	*	Hahahhaahhahahahahahahahah
t1_dshnp63	0	*	no. im a russian spy paid by putin to gas light reddit into thinking that more ppl hold my views than not. i was hired by trump via putin

t1_dshqf8x	1	*	Umm, he had a 16 year career with the KGB and a much longer relationship with them. He was the director of the FSB at one (admittedly brief) point.
t1_dshyhgw	1	*	I would like to have a similar list of countries for the US though. Just to have handy
t1_dshra4h	0	*	You gave enough shits to leave a comment.

t1_dshmrgu	0	*	theres the 100th comment complaining about whataboutism
t1_dshsr7d	0	*	We reap what we sow. If as much people cared about Russia as they did the chaos the US sows, this country and world would be a better place. 
t1_dshotsj	0	*	The language does not at all have to be spun in order for it to be propaganda....  And it's not like stuff like this hasn't happend before.

t1_dshvmbf	1	*	Yeah, no one talks about the US bombing other countries...

t1_dshslto	1	*	..... But isn't that interfering?
t1_dshfnee	1	*	Are you being serious?
t1_dsim5a7	1	*	I concede, russia has made a grave mistake and caused world war 3 with memes.
t1_dsi0388	0	*	If you believe this, theres a good chance you also believe trickle down economics actually works. 
t1_dshsv0y	1	*	The United States isn't even on the list.  I can almost guarantee you that Poland's government is of extreme interest to Putin
t1_dshp1bd	1	*	Hahahahah okay yeah sure 
t1_dsicbiw	1	*	No but sometimes americans get an impression that their country is an angel when it comes to foreign policy
t1_dshooxk	0	*	... Yeah, i bet you iceland really needed labour to lose that election.  Frankly that is just a ridiculous notion, if you mean most/all major powers then that is a very differnet thing.
t1_dsht81p	1	*	Yes! Exactly. Can't believe there's a positive outlook to be had over this mess. Thanks for pointing that out.
t1_dshv666	1	*	It says Georgia right there.

t1_dshpuq8	1	*	You're right only a handful does it, the US being the largest.
t1_dshr5co	0	*	Yeah, with Poland, it was easier to just crash their plane with government aboard...
t1_dshynbq	0	*	Not if there is a connection between Russia and Murdoch. Did you know Putin's gf is Murdoch's ex wife?
t1_dshxfor	1	*	we are the good guys because we interfere for the right reason. we interfere for the right reasons because we're the good guys.

t1_dshoq7g	0	*	I'm a bit offended that they missed us.   Come on guys, we're a real nation too! 
t1_dsi482v	1	*	That wasn't an election.
t1_dshqqko	1	*	Knowing that this is made by the government of the US, I don't expect to see any mention of Russian meddling in the American elections by the current administration.
t1_dshy57f	1	*	EPIC BURN! 
t1_dsih4rc	0	*	Over 80
t1_dshq9cn	1	*	What exactly did she say about Russian interference?
t1_dshx0ww	0	*	I don't buy this. People are taught this and conditioned to accept it based on unique and unnatural social structures. Barbarism isn't a norm. 
t1_dsi4vby	1	*	Hitler might be a stretch but there are plenty of people out there that really don't like him. And for good reason.
t1_dshbx3w	0	*	they probably do not. im skeptical that countries would prefer the us influence specially with trump
t1_dsin4om	1	*	Same for me with Poland...
t1_dsiaiat	1	*	Swedes and Norwegians, come join our circlejerk!
t1_dsi7rcd	1	*	Yeah... Russia tries for subtle but effective not shit-face and screaming crazy
t1_dshpw0o	1	*	Unless your not American and then its probably the opposite. 
t1_dshrxzq	1	*	it is implicit that they list only countries outside Russia
t1_dshqtxu	0	*	The difference is that we actually [brag about it.](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19960715,00.html)
t1_dshphno	1	*	Totally agree, I think the fact that the US has done it so often should be even more evidence at how often outside countries will attempt to influence our elections.
t1_dshuhnx	0	*	A Democrat Senator. No conflict of interests there at all huh. 
t1_dsikyzg	0	*	Eh with the push for the Nuclear Power Plants, who knows?  Then again its hard to tell between Zuma, Guptas, Russia and potentially the Chinese these days. 
t1_dshplzb	1	*	yeah, im sure you know exactly what he did... /s
t1_dtpabo0	0	*	Why would knowing how many countries the US has interfered with negate the concern for Russian election meddling? 
t1_dsba4wx	0	*	For each little thing apparently, like murdering multiple people.
t1_dsbex6d	1	*	Sex is more offensive than violence. 
t1_dsyjbk6	1	*	Wrongful/deceitful accusation is universal and not specific to sex

t1_dtik9so	0	*	Teenagers launching an international lawsuit because they suffer emotional damage for missing a concert. I hope this lawsuit bankrupts their family. The self entitlement is ridiculous. 
t1_dsw9h15	0	*	Thanks for sharing the quotes and all after mentioning them. Awesome
t1_du00kc5	1	*	Don't discount individual experience. 
t1_dt8slrk	1	*	Unlikely because they dug up known graves to fill the catacombs. 
t1_dt9heow	0	*	>also im proud to be a zionist  No one cares
t1_dt9t800	1	*	I used it to make that 75%. A real percentage would have been closer to 65% or 85% or something like that.
t1_dta7od1	1	*	Yeah, but I just think its neat that someone made the journey a hundred thousand years before anyone else. His group was probably one of the first humans to make it that far. 
t1_dt9kdmx	1	*	You got the pun, my man!
t1_dta65jc	1	*	This is amazing! 
t1_dtalwvi	1	*	I'd love to see what's in Doggerland. It must be a massive treasure trove of all sorts of archaeological finds.

t1_dsh5lcm	1	*	Classic the independent.
t1_ds93tqe	0	*	Turkey could be the literal Garden of Eden and Macron/France would not accept it into the EU.  Macron is using Turkey's current problems as a cover for his inherent racism.

t1_ds9yqyl	0	*	I would say the sentiment is mutual between Turks and gulf Arabs, at least. Were not exactly fond of the Turks.

t1_ds9kqni	1	*	What an original joke as if I haven't seen this as a couple of million times.
t1_ds9kg6f	1	*	The only one who wants Turkey to become a EU member is the UK.
t1_ds95ul8	1	*	This, but unironic.
t1_ds92947	0	*	I think he cares a lot
t1_ds8vqxx	1	*	Wow, this gets so many votes. RIP reddit.
t1_ds9qw11	1	*	Macron is great. He speaks his mind but in a good way (unlike Trump). Oh and he's very smart.
t1_ds8ybz0	1	*	Nice reddit account.
t1_ds8srsc	1	*	That shouldn't be funny but it is.
t1_dssbkjo	1	*	This makes a huge difference though 
t1_dsspm69	0	*	Right, you can't start a war for no reason.  Once the war has started, though, if while you're fighting they decide to convert, you can't kill them.  If they don't want to convert, then continue.
t1_dss98g5	0	*	> E: why is this controversial lol? Is something I said wrong?  Simply because Islam is so controversial.

t1_dssbl3l	1	*	God, I hate that word. Used solely to manipulate commoners into an emotional state.
t1_dssa4p8	1	*	Yes, the fatwa is a way of highlighting that. 
t1_dssft6a	0	*	Please pardon the ignorance. Do you have a good reference on the difference between the sects so I can better understand the reference?
t1_dsssqts	1	*	I hope you know Naipaul is extremely anti-India in his speeches and he barely has visited India to even jump on the anti-Pakistan bandwagon. What I'm saying here is he compared two shitholes.
t1_dst6d9m	1	*	Happily there is only one Islam. The correct one. All the others are unIslamic
t1_dsu7m2u	0	*	> The foreign aid budget does not affect them at all  I doubt that.
t1_dssg9n2	0	*	Of course its relevant. If 1,800 is 90% of the clerics in Pakistan that means most of them agree. If it's 10% of them than most of them don't agree.
t1_dsri76w	0	*	Many clerics were always against it. It's really just those clerics from radical sects that are for it. And suicide is literally prohibited in the Hadith.
t1_dsseps9	1	*	moving a pastor to a different congregation in a different county is not denouncing his actions. its covering them up and allowing them to do it again.
t1_dstcevi	1	*	Not necessarily, there are debate among people who have more or less the same flavor of islam about how to deal with suicide attacks.
t1_dsrp3n1	1	*	It's by no means the first time they condemned them, they do it regularly. Though I thinks it's unprecedented that such a large number of clerics issue a fatwa.
t1_dst3mok	0	*	Is this a correction of my comment or just an apologists attempt to cut Muslim ideology some slack?
t1_dsrzhe3	0	*	Well then it is pretty sad they need officials that they look up to make them realize blowing yourself up is not the best way to make your point.
t1_dsspjq0	1	*	*Whooosh.* 
t1_dssfwp2	1	*	See the thing is, all sects of Islam consider suicide a one-way ticket to hell... so yeah
t1_dss48w7	1	*	Weren't those things planned to take place by a larger, already organized civil rights movement?
t1_dsryjss	1	*	Finally? What rock have you been living under?
t1_dsrrpkx	1	*	Nothing too subtle about it. I mean it's subtle compared to the lines coming from your typical Muslim hating dolt, but that is a really low bar. I would still call it a damned obvious troll.
t1_dssbkjx	1	*	This is a small step at changing culture. It will take time but small steps are the only way cultures change. 
t1_dss04sq	1	*	Peace in the middle east or the sweet release of death? Sign me up fam.

t1_dtd9mkj	1	*	Where the fuck do you live so I can never visit?

t1_du8xhez	0	*	If I could have cartilidge in my knees again I would be so happy, I don't even remember what it felt like.
t1_du7hml7	1	*	Isn't there some disease or disorder that causes people to have abnormally dense bones? And one of the symptoms is the inability to swim, because they sink like a rock.
t1_du86h7s	1	*	Because you cannot separate climate change science from economics. And in a democracy, economics are a big incentive for politics.
t1_du7c6xn	0	*	totally worth it

t1_dudv9jk	1	*	No no no, China won't assert their own rights this time around.   They're going to help Russia assert theirs.
t1_dt7nwgl	0	*	No. The first one was a year ago.  Then 9 months ago. (3 months later)  The 5 months ago. (4 months later)  And now we're at 5 months later, so it's about time to get demolished again.

t1_dsno9ju	1	*	Entirely justifiable and it must be a slow news day. 
t1_dsnwddq	1	*	uhh well it has a lot to do with his white house not responding to the WTO 
t1_dsnyalp	1	*	> Lincoln, this would've happened regardless.   False, there was no WTO when Lincoln was president. 
t1_dsnqhpy	1	*	Honestly you make it easy for us Europeans to root for china rather than the U.S as well.
t1_dslo0db	1	*	Or we can see with our actual eyes that he's very fat, so there's no way he's in excellent health.

t1_du4cubo	0	*	Just so we're clear this guy's entire post history has been archived anyway. Deleting it just makes him look more guilty :)

t1_du48yq8	1	*	FEMA is worse than any natural disaster.
t1_du5lz2x	1	*	Digging through granite rock is not fun, 10x cost is a very optimistic estimate. Add to this the immediate need for people to have their power restored, UG takes too long too.
t1_du44xt4	1	*	Not only that, but this problem is endemic to A LOT of cities in the US.
t1_du42amy	1	*	Lmao
t1_du4atbj	1	*	But, but....Trump!
t1_du498s6	1	*	But when a whole city has problems with their homes like that, shouldn't the government help?
t1_du45r1u	0	*	A capitalist owns the means of production, kinda hard to do by yourself, although I think some petty bourgeois (small shop owners) are allowed to produce and sell surplus.

t1_du44c6j	0	*	Yeah but those are third world countries, you shouldn't have to go that far down to make Puerto Rico's loss of electricity not seem bad  
t1_dtt1dua	1	*	Considering they're 3.8 billion light years away, there's a reasonable chance they don't even exist anymore.
t1_dtspr0v	0	*	Would I be right in saying that by the time you get there, the planet (if it still existed) would have moved elsewhere, along with the galaxy? Is it even theoretically possible to visit?

t1_duiw8cu	1	*	We should deal with our own domestic problems. In the states, Christians are a problem, but Muslims are not. They are not as large of a minority as they are in Europe.

t1_ds4k1jw	1	*	Get off the pipe
t1_ds4qhsz	1	*	Just tear gas, flashbangs and rubber bullets. Also US citizens are pretty used to being shot at by the police so tried to avoid escalation.

t1_ds4x267	1	*	Thatd be a huge benefit if youre the least principled actor subject to the most criticism from your conduct.   Putin understands this.

t1_ds4vqs3	1	*	Don't make it political? Motherfucker are you stupid
t1_ds4ztg6	0	*	Yah the US as a whole is far superior than Iran in my mind, especially since Iran is killing people. My point was how much each government listens to their people, which seems to be close to equal. 
t1_ds4qzt6	1	*	Theres a biiiiiiig fucking difference between employing riot control tactics and firing live rounds into a crowd. 
t1_ds54jzd	0	*	Except when it's coming from the russian propaganda channel (RT).  I'm at a loss why they air that in the states.

t1_ds4pl5j	0	*	A meme book by a insane Russian nationalist and is at large considered a joke in Russia

t1_ds4vi52	0	*	Not carring about spelling on reddit, my username is not racist, it's just not English. 
t1_ds55ing	1	*	The movement also had no real leader and no clear policy or political goals. Then parasite druggies infiltrated the space and tainted it.

t1_ds4qdfj	1	*	Tear gas and bean bag guns? Such cruelty!
t1_ds4s2hs	1	*	The way you stop a riot matters. 
t1_ds4pbbh	0	*	Stop pushing your blatant bootlicker propaganda. The police made a barrier and everything and prevented entrance/exit, smashed tents, and arrested protesters once winter hit.  It didn't fizzle out
t1_ds4sak4	1	*	Enjoy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxTl1Ykbuww  people didnt know what the hell they were doing there.  
t1_ds5ck8u	1	*	Remember- a lot of those posters are likely Russian provocatuers.

t1_ds4qa81	0	*	classic whataboutism
t1_ds4or0r	1	*	Immediately thought of this. There are even people on Reddit who relay the same experience first hand. 
t1_dstdwgv	1	*	I'm only willing to claim they are wet, not aquatic.

t1_dsvr7zz	1	*	NK is poor, usually these boats are really underequiped or not very good, so they die of exposure to elements, starvation, they get stranded, ect. It's been going on for many many years.
t1_dsvqztv	1	*	You should post a screen cap of the hateful PMs. That's unacceptable if true
t1_dsuky9n	1	*	You're a good guy.  I like you.
t1_dsupy4y	0	*	Ok, I just want everyone to know that we can type NoKo. I personal feel that no, never say that out loud. Even if you are a lobbyist on lunch.
t1_ds1x0fv	1	*	He can practice his religion all right, like everyone else in France. 
t1_dtrfvuw	1	*	A state is a monopoly on violence. Even liberal minded people accept that. 
t1_dtqzfip	1	*	They file for permits too, just because the permits are illegal doesn't mean they don't exist.
t1_dtrd6sh	0	*	Except that Palestine isn't quite yet recognised as a state. 
t1_dtraziw	1	*	Sounds familiar 
t1_dtr8tmf	0	*	I hate that strawman black and white bullshit you are spouting with a passion.   It's not either or. Both can be dickbags. Both can be in error. Both can be victims. Both can be murdering scum. 
t1_dtruzza	0	*	That's the joke.
t1_dtrm2tz	0	*	Oh, but this isn't genocide.
t1_dtrsobp	1	*	You see these shady sites, Im not asking for that.  You seem to know a lot about the permitting process there.  How does it work?  Try thinking on your own
t1_dtr5q00	1	*	Alright, fuck both

t1_ds3cjl7	1	*	ah shite, my bad, kinda funny but,  I thought I was commenting on this article https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/7nn24k/john_mccain_and_other_neocons_whove_spent_a/
t1_ds3r74d	0	*	how does that work? reddit isn't a first-past-the-post election. do people say, I can't upvote this article, because I just upvoted a different one of the same topic. ?
t1_ds3ggkp	1	*	Or more so, what motivates our involvement..
t1_dsidz88	1	*	The UK can still refuse accreditation and arrest him nonetheless.

t1_dt5zpa2	1	*	lololololololol knee slapper right there
t1_dt62zik	0	*	I was banned from there for making a joke about a trump denial bingo card.  It wasn't inflammatory, but the reaction from the mod, when questioned, was hilarious.
t1_dt67gju	0	*	Do people on reddit legitimately believe trump is going to be impeached? Lmfao  Wed be even worse off with his replacement anyways
t1_dt64qm1	0	*	To your point, if the investigation hasn't been concluded, you can't say he's guilty either.
t1_dt5vutr	1	*	What a shame you didn't mention your ironclad evidence for this.
t1_dt5vkuv	1	*	CNBC is not real.  The MSM is propaganda.  Have you not figured this out by now?  
t1_dt628t9	1	*	You know how.
t1_dt60jty	1	*	They were saying this at the beginning of the investigation. Wonder what made them change their tune? 
t1_dt61jyv	0	*	Go back to finding Mayline drafting tables pal, your IQ level doesn't have enough surplus to talk about such topics.
t1_dt67prx	1	*	Except Obama is Nixon in this case 
t1_dt651nl	1	*	That's not how it works at all. Having a majority doesn't mean having absolute control.
t1_dt63ovt	1	*	Most rational people dislike ANTIFA 
t1_dt5xx9g	1	*	The Dotard supporters in full force. You're going to spin so much when the Mueller hammer drops you'll end up inside your own asshole.   Sad. 
t1_dt6dzrr	1	*	So basically nothing of note happened yesterday
t1_dt5vrvq	1	*	> social security number  they have those, too.
t1_dt5y911	1	*	Kinda a problem when there are potentially people in the DOJ and FBI that actively worked to undermine the President.  If that's the case, your narrative gets completely tossed on its head.
t1_dt5z9a1	1	*	Whats up with all the convictions then? Deep Soros? 
t1_dt5vh52	0	*	Why is that relevant? OP could still be a bot posting existing news articles to sway opinion...
t1_dt5zklg	0	*	Do you similarly think that no Democrat is *really* bothered by a little light undermining of our democratic process or light treason?
t1_dt5vtcm	1	*	and some sides are probably paying the russian bot farms to spew nonsense that they will then blame on the all-mighty Putin god of Russia and his LEET KGB operatives
t1_dt5r7vz	0	*	Where did anyone call you a trump supporter?
t1_dt5r116	0	*	What's the weather like in Russia today?

t1_dt5ysw6	1	*	Yeah that's what I thought too
t1_dt697ld	1	*	Take em all down. I don't care if all but 5 congress people are left when Mueller is done.
t1_dt5z8fq	0	*	Those are all assumptions as of right now and won't hold water in court. You need some proof. But what were Dems up to with the Steele dossier and Fusion GPS. Now that's some shady business
t1_dt5ygl1	1	*	Is there anything bad going on that russia isn't responsible for?
t1_dt5vhmj	0	*	> Uranium One? Rings a bell? >  > Educate yourself, fool.  The irony. She burns.

t1_dt6jlyo	1	*	Does Aluminum Foil cause balding?
t1_dt61b6m	1	*	It took 4 years actually.
t1_dt5uk2q	1	*	So, just because hes a republican, he cant be trusted? Party affiliation does NOT imply conflict of interest. 
t1_dt5uk2p	1	*	Trumps teams are getting good at lying their way out of a lie so Mueller might have to prepare for that bonus lie too. 
t1_dt5yxmh	0	*	It's amazing how certain some people are then.
t1_dt5ywmj	1	*	If an indictment and a plea deal for two of his top officials is nothing, I think you set the bar a wee bit high.
t1_dt5w7kp	1	*	Or he proved that the democrats fabricated the Russia narrative in order to not accept responsibility for losing in 2016....
t1_dt6293p	0	*	No it gets shills a lot but theres plenty of people who dont identify as either left or right 
t1_dt6u47s	1	*	This is not a trial, it's just a plot to shame the office cause they lost, just like the people who hated Obama. 
t1_dt5yoyr	1	*	Can't wait to watch the twitch stream!
t1_dt5vnlx	0	*	Pretty much all of them.
t1_dt616v3	1	*	Most of Mueller's team left lucrative positions to join him. They aren't in it for the money.
t1_dt69h1q	0	*	Hey, where's the dancing Pikachu?
t1_dt70bof	1	*	Bush didnt do that. It was the administration. 8 us attorneys were fired for it. It was actually more around 22 m not 2.1
t1_dt69mk3	1	*	lad
t1_dt6nzsi	1	*	And this is politics 2.0
t1_dt5zi4y	1	*	Also, like reddit seems unwilling to differentiate between shill and fan.  Though, for many, there might not be a difference.
t1_dt62acs	0	*	I think I read it wasn't on Mueller but on Rosenstein.  Apparently he allowed the continued FISA abuse.  Not sure though as I have clearly not read it. 
t1_dt670il	1	*	It doesn't seem to matter, if you post anything remotely against the ciclejerk, you get accused of being a 'paid shill' of whatever boogeyman or 'enemy' is in vogue.

t1_dt5x5i4	0	*	> https://www.globalresearch.ca  Get a new source. This one is fucking garbage.
t1_dt68n0q	0	*	Being skeptical is fine. Blasting the agency over political bullshit to impede an apolitical investigation is damaging.  No we're not close, but we're inching closer.

t1_dt64awi	0	*	Sounds like an admittance to squirming but I'm no lawyer;)

t1_dt606l1	0	*	>So why dont the republicans put up or shut up? If there is something truly damning in there, the memo should speak for itself, right?  Have you been on the internet this week?

t1_dt61myq	1	*	> Facts be damned.  You realize you are simply asserting your theory without evidence, right?  
t1_dt6c72m	1	*	Bank records are expected to reveal widespread money laundering. Emails were probably just the pointers for where to look. 
t1_dt65hho	1	*	They hired a famous personnel PR expert named Joseph McCarthy. Really interesting stuff he has on how to catch a Russian bot.
t1_dt5wqsb	1	*	Show us that analysis youve done. Or is it possible youre lying?

t1_dt7515a	0	*	I'm sure most Republicans want nothing more than Trump's impeachment so they can get the exact same policies without all the drama with Mike Pence.
t1_dt69qbw	0	*	Theres nothing perceived about it. He lied under oath about having meetings with Russians, lied about the reason Comey was fired, and is now actively purging the FBI or democrats.

t1_dsxngjd	1	*	A lot of rich people in other countries actually use the US for tax avoidance because of the comparatively lower taxes here versus places like Europe.
t1_dt019t3	1	*	tax evaders are traitors
t1_dsy8zg1	1	*	I thought I was trippin reading it the first time.
t1_dtmkgfe	1	*	Official surrender of Japan and peace treaty between Japan and Country X, also including territorial disputes, if any, are two different things or am I wrong?
t1_ds9uxow	0	*	But body for body size?  You usually get a mouse and an owl which is hugely different.
t1_dskjgfj	1	*	I was a shift manager at Qdoba for years and half our kitchen staff were illegals. One got deported for it eventually but not the rest.
t1_dtejyj0	0	*	If you try harder you could. I mean seriously harder. Like in the middle of a desert or some far away place like Northern Canada.
t1_dtem971	1	*	Friday night lights
t1_dtuse2l	0	*	There are plenty of of places that sell rare earth minerals, China would get fucked in a trade war. 
t1_dtvt6jp	1	*	You'll be fine. Those who talk the most shit are the biggest cowards
t1_dsug89z	1	*	The entitlement is strong on Reddit. 
t1_dsu4htw	1	*	That's the opposite of what the rest of us think so I wouldn't call it common at all
t1_dstziip	0	*	where the fuck do you get that information?
t1_dsuacct	1	*	Teachers can easily take a year off.
t1_dsttfrv	1	*	It's not an obligation; it's a way to get loyal employees.      If you treat people like disposable assets they will behave like one.
t1_dstoz76	0	*	That's a bit harsh. Our ancestors managed, but it wasn't as easy.
t1_dstmp0l	0	*	Ah, that classic American conservative/puritan/capitalist sentiment:  *I accumulated my wealth horde by working hard; fuck the less fortunate because they're probably lazy*
t1_dt3caoa	0	*	Turkey wanted Kobane to be taken by ISIS.. Sorry, but you're making shit up and trying to fool people.
t1_dv45uzs	1	*	But that's the joke. Americans don't know that other countries exist.
t1_dv4lkak	1	*	Its there and it makes sense. What the point of any 'union' if everyone is divided in times of conflict?
t1_dv3tei7	1	*	Considering 36% of America seems to be giving Putin head...
t1_dv4lkze	1	*	There is test footage in each clip.
t1_dv41gs0	0	*	Get your gun and start walking then
t1_dv43ouh	1	*	Neither is Finnland and they have a huge border with Russia and had a serious war going on there WWII....
t1_dv3vp4p	1	*	It is weird to think that Putin doesnt care about the US. He ONLY cares about the US. And now, we and the majority of Europe resent him as never before. He IS scared. 
t1_dtwn4dt	1	*	lazy troll you.
t1_dtvy8sq	1	*	Nor is it hard to make. If you've got a bottle of Clorox and some vinegar at home you too can make some!   
t1_dv1pp77	0	*	You know if losses were significant enough they'd bring back the draft, yes?
t1_ds3evqv	1	*	Australia's least deadly snake. It came up with the name in hopes of making people thing twice about messing with it, but in reality it's bite just causes mild giggling and gas.
t1_ds3b9iv	1	*	I was thinking something more along the lines of Fluffy Cuddlesnake Loves-lots-of-hugs. But yours is better.
t1_ds3fuue	1	*	Only certain guns were outlawed.
t1_ds3bkk7	1	*	Cant beat this one 
t1_ds3up57	1	*	Danger Noodles 
t1_ds442uy	1	*	I couldnt see that in the article. But school also finished on the 15th of December.
t1_ds3n3sf	1	*	Well yeahhhh, I mean we've all seen Mad Max and Fury Road, I think we kinda know what it's like.
t1_ds3ohqs	1	*	Pretty much all the snakes in Australia blend in though, they need camouflage to hunt. Tiger snakes especially vary hugely region to region, to blend in with the local environment 
t1_ds39rcd	1	*	You're saying *Brown* an awful lot. Are you feeling okay?
t1_ds4i1li	1	*	*death noodle
t1_ds4xl7a	1	*	Kevin Durant
t1_ds372e5	1	*	Probably worth it.
t1_ds3lcfl	0	*	Our spiders in the US arent really deadly unless you are old or a young child. Even then we only have two species that can really hurt you. 
t1_ds3z9ld	1	*	The worlds most venomous children, I presume. 
t1_ds3mw9c	1	*	I think it's because of fear mongering.
t1_ds44iqd	1	*	Well, no poisonous snakes.
t1_ds479kg	0	*	In all fairness I didnt want to click on the link to the article and have to look at a pic of a nope rope...they give me the heebie jeebies 
t1_dt1snq5	1	*	Reddit never fails to impress me with its ability to concentrate so many crazy people in one place.
t1_dsim6m4	0	*	Did he specify dutch politicians? :/
t1_duinqnn	0	*	Can we blame global warming on poor people too?
t1_duimxcj	1	*	This is a good start and a great idea in a place like Costa Rica which has a booming tourism industry. 
t1_ds30whd	1	*	Well the relevant statistic would be population density, and the UK is more densely populated than the US
t1_ds3d6h6	0	*	Looks like a death trap to me.  What about the methheads, muggers and rapists who will hang out down there? Don't you have violent crime in your country? 
t1_du8ztru	1	*	Nope. They signed joint declaration, but the peace treaty was cock-blocked by the US.  Shikotan and Habomai would be returned to Japan after the conclusion of a peace treaty.
t1_du8vlrh	0	*	Japan and Russia fought each other before operation Barbarossa. Okay granted they were border skirmishes. But still the Japanese got knocked hard enough not to mess with Russia.
t1_du9bs1h	0	*	Truth. Apparently pro Russia folks have been fed the idea that the mighty soviet military rolled over China and Japan. Not the case.
t1_dsz51ge	1	*	Mexico will pay for it.
t1_dtw6wvt	0	*	Bad things happen when Europe starts re-arming.
t1_duqi21e	0	*	All America does is print fiat.. if they print anymore, inflation will go through the roof. This is why interest rates need to rise. Unless inflation is the goal like finance secretary mnuchin said. 
t1_dsbygxp	0	*	You mean a dictatorship where The Party decides what is right and what not. It is just the catholic church serves their purpose, which they are not to be held to the laws everybody else has to.
t1_dsc62u4	0	*	I was being sarcastic. That's what they're basically saying with this decision. 
t1_dsbyr8t	1	*	That's What he said ... <rimshot>
t1_dsbzfum	1	*	It might collapse the roof too. 
t1_dtub2b3	1	*	Got downvotes for telling the truth. Germany bans everything related to the Little Korporal even to censoring video games. At best its sad, at worse its damn near 1984 
t1_du4uje3	0	*	That means attacking Israel isn't a violation either. 
t1_ducd81u	1	*	Ahh the classic you have hurt the feeling of the chinese people argument. 
t1_duc2miz	1	*	I didn't really look at it that way, but that's a very good way to put it. In my honest opinion, I think it is all propaganda. 
t1_duwqeir	1	*	I dont think STD's kill that quickly
t1_dux29hv	1	*	its a comedy, we just don't get it.
t1_duwq30n	1	*	Plus she's probably too old, unless she was underage at the time of the pee pee incident.

t1_du672r2	1	*	Take me home, Country roads  Lol

t1_dt0nfah	1	*	Its a troll
t1_du6vmnr	0	*	You make my brain hurt.
t1_du6xwjl	1	*	As I said: Deluded person believes what he says.
t1_du6uquu	1	*	Right.
t1_dsp84r9	1	*	The Clinton Foundation? Are you suggesting a kindly old grandmother like Hillary Clinton somehow be  involved in the drug trade?  xD
t1_dsh6fwm	0	*	That military industrial complex presides over the safest, most prosperous era this world has ever seen.  It's a far cry from ineffective. 
t1_dsgxih1	0	*	I'll leave this here: https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/562466745340817408/_nI.jpeg
t1_dsh1ody	0	*	the ecb cant even consolidate its debt. the euro is a worse version of the us dollar
t1_dshhomp	1	*	Sensational headline? On Reddit no less? That's unpossible!
t1_dshh9w4	0	*	Why allow the Chinese to own land or shares in companies when it is nearly impossible for foreigners to do the same in China?
t1_dsh28x0	0	*	It depends. UK is one of two major financial backers of the EU as far as economies. France, Spain, etc, have financial problems. Without Germany, EU falls apart.
t1_du5btm0	1	*	Rational arguments generally don't work on hyper-religious types.   Otherwise, there'd be no hyper-religious people
t1_du4fdxh	1	*	Was?
t1_du4cq6g	0	*	Oops
t1_dudsqbt	0	*	Which is why we must continue to be hostile. To save our countries from destruction.
t1_dscn1zu	1	*	We could have made smaller space planes, ask me how I know. 
t1_dtytccg	0	*	Its poorly sourced and makes no sense. Whats got to give? The title makes no sense. SK and the US are already incredibly close.
t1_dthkc90	1	*	The mis-managers are in charge though.
t1_dszun5k	0	*	Good...Let's get this war started before China is a superpower.
t1_dt74vov	1	*	He could save others from death?
t1_dtzvc2n	0	*	more and more clues (Clinton's machine produces clues on regular bases), and still zero proof. It is going to stay that way until 2024 when Ivanka Trump is voted for the next US president.
t1_dtyynzl	1	*	And Putin has finally driven a wedge between the members of the NATO alliance. Something the Russians have wanted since the 1940s.  
t1_dtyrqtr	1	*	Great username :) 
t1_dtxusxx	0	*	Took multiple years to bring Nixon down. Trump's impeachment would be, like, December at the extreme earliest. 
t1_dtxtrkh	0	*	Doubt it. Im thinking another year until a case is compiled.

t1_dtxucyc	0	*	And he's selling this country out to Russian oligarchs at the expense of working Americans. This is what pisses me off the most.
t1_dtxu2k1	0	*	Its one of several, but I love how your name pops up anytime these Reddit posts come up.  Usually with this same type of comment no less!  
t1_dtyzu04	1	*	http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/451053/not-comeys-decision-exonerate-hillary-obamas-decision
t1_dtr6dev	0	*	First time in 50 years, except last time it happened (2015)
t1_dtrcy7o	1	*	Sure, but the party in power has spent years talking about how the country is ruined by it's debt and that it absolutely must be drastically reduced. Now they're in power, this.
t1_dtr6qcb	1	*	> They'll just cut Medicare, Medicaid, and means-test Social Security to pay for it.  Oh good. It's not like we were using those...
t1_dupzo9g	1	*	Sounds fine to me 
t1_duq44hb	1	*	there is nothing on svalbard have it on a god forsaken land where it might not get a nuclear bomb right ontop of it. 
t1_dur3te1	0	*	> Democratic socialism  No. Social democracy, not democratic socialism.
t1_duq49ct	0	*	It's from Futurama.
t1_duq7ev4	1	*	Youre the one who likes it so much. You do it.
t1_duqf5ex	1	*	That's what people on Mars were saying about the 3rd planet from the sun. About 1,000,000 years ago.
t1_dupztu1	1	*	Yeah well we would place it somewhere more sensible, but the problem with that is that there's a fuckton of people everywhere more sensible, which also tends to make shit a target.
t1_dur227d	1	*	The ISS is not in a stable orbit. I constantly needs boosting to keep in orbit. 
t1_ds3dz6o	0	*	[Lets watch this.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/083/377/f7d.jpg)
t1_dsd9fjv	0	*	yea my ultimate idea is that we could be using that border wall money to actually advance humanity and our society instead of a useless concrete facade to keep people in/out.
t1_dtyp46w	1	*	Being attractive is sexist and offensive.  I don't want look at your pretty face and feel like shit. /s  I guess models in Sweden will be getting slightly less work?  
t1_dsl9yi4	1	*	Worse.........?............Better.            (and the sooner the better.)
t1_dsl9zut	1	*	how about we just claim to have it and demand trump do something and see if he does it? 
t1_du2ql9r	1	*	Considering that east germany has yet to recover despite the probably trillions invested, i think this crisis is gonna last.
t1_duquv2q	1	*	what actual links to al qaeda did hussein have? Cuz the CIA had plenty
t1_dsczr6k	0	*	I assumed Putin was a power top.
t1_dsdpbgc	1	*	> a control packet of a salt mining company  ... A what now?
t1_dsd5yty	1	*	Yeah, unbelievable is what someone thought about Trump taking credit for worldwide safety in commercial flights.  Few hours later, he took credit for safety in commercial flights worldwide.
t1_dsd0jca	1	*	Using the word unbelievable in relation to what trump says or does is highly redundant.
t1_dsdyrti	1	*	Sure, but what good can come out of it? It's a country full of Wahhabists. You want to replace the current Wahhabist government with an even more extreme Wahhabist government?
t1_dsdfb46	1	*	That's not in the book.  
t1_dta81p4	1	*	Correct. All lazy hypocrites anyway  
t1_dtarwny	0	*	Where is the money suppose to come from?
t1_dutc178	0	*	Like Fergie does. 
t1_dutb8mp	1	*	1776-1786? /s
t1_dt7k753	1	*	A lot of it gets exported too. Lots goes to Korea unfortunately.
t1_dv2vb8x	1	*	I'm pretty sure its a term designed to avoid the inevitable assault rifle isn't an actual thing debates that crop up in every gun thread.  Didn't work though.
t1_dv1m9ac	0	*	Thanks for the shining neon sign to stop conversing with you.
t1_dv2hqwg	0	*	Those cheap labourers are happy to have a job...
t1_dv289k4	0	*	Its not a pain...you need a licence and have to take a firearms safety course and belong to a gun club....its all pretty reasonable
t1_dv1g588	0	*	That's not a connection, that's a market.
t1_dtu7teu	1	*	Luckily Im in a medium sized but very isolated city of 1.2 mill, the outbreak should hopefully be limited here...
t1_dsm5w67	0	*	Holy fuck, that was a risky click....
t1_duy0kqs	1	*	Yeah! She's my cherry pie
t1_duy5upi	1	*	Just got it !
t1_duy45h7	1	*	Its not actually banned though. This is poor reporting.  
t1_dsve14n	1	*	good point. I was thinking universal service, not selective. very good point.
t1_dswic6j	0	*	Not to mention the insane amount of gun owners salivating at the chance to kill me some commies!
t1_dswjkoc	0	*	No but when a house needs to be cleared and every single one of them has a good chance of being strapped, it slows things down.
t1_dswpsqv	0	*	> Plus Putin just generally hates the Swedish.  Ah, to live in the Matrix again... ;)
t1_dsw2su7	0	*	Not everyone is cut out for the military, and its not that great a prep for civilian life. For some it is, but plenty of people do fine without ever having served.
t1_dsvw13q	1	*	So basicly, delay until someone else comes along with a better military. If that's what works, that's what works.
t1_dsv9y3r	0	*	So the only difference between Total War and Total Defence is that you don't outright kill your enemies, which under a Total War doctrine includes everyone?
t1_dsvikec	1	*	The Vietnam war did not help much there. Especially since all of the rich kids like Trump were able to dodge the draft.  People haven't learned a thing.
t1_dswfe4p	0	*	All those rednecks you make fun of would be just fine..
t1_dsx81no	1	*	I like it. not all will want to go to college, so GI bill wont be as high as you might initially think.
t1_dtt2icw	0	*	Since the US pays the bills. 
t1_dts715r	0	*	in that it plays well to his base and will get him reelected even though it won't make any progress towards their goals. Rinse, repeat. 
t1_dtslol1	1	*	Not yet
t1_dttm1dj	0	*	I think you'd rather side with settlers because you don't want to internalise the implications of settler colonialism.
t1_dtube5d	1	*	Care to elaborate?
t1_dtsh1d8	1	*	Moreover, Israel doesn't actually want elections, since it's likely a *more* radical group would win them.  It's mostly a talking point, and one I think Israel avoids most of the time.
t1_dtthfie	0	*	> none of those 3 women are bimbos  At least 2 are. You have to be a bimbo to defend and promote the anti vaccine movement. Also to attack a rape victim in court.
t1_dtsceqg	1	*	Yep, we've pretty much discredited ourselves as a part of the solution through our wholehearted support of one side. We've shown no sign of impartiality under Trump.
t1_dtu3m24	0	*	Well violence hasnt worked well for the palesrinians, so they may want to try a new approach
t1_dtsb30h	0	*	It's a strategic position in the region, with nukes at their disposal. Obviously the USA will support that. No need to threaten nuking Pakistan or Iran yourself, amirite?
t1_dtsrcgw	1	*	I'm having some mental dexterity exercises moving commas around your words.
t1_dtsal1o	1	*	Exactly. Cause and effect. Action and reaction. 
t1_dts4z8j	1	*	Wrong 
t1_dtsc8dh	0	*	Its by no means solely because of religion. There's a reason Palestinians throw a fit at any archaeological attempts made by Israelis. It only solidifies the history more so.
t1_dtsyvz8	1	*	Haiti is a shithole.
t1_dttwobz	1	*	lol
t1_dspw1fo	0	*	Is that a KSP reference?
t1_dtezcd9	1	*	Not surprising of a Murdoch paper.
t1_dtbogn7	0	*	If someone goes and takes a shit in a toilet it's business as usual. If someone takes a shit on a kitchen table people notice. 
t1_dtbpjui	1	*	Because terror attacks in these countries are normal and not so normal in the civilized world. Paris is a major Tourist destination and kabul Afghanistan isn't.
t1_dtv5rlc	1	*	Damn, you just kept hitting him.
t1_dsihq29	0	*	> r 400+ videos of 250+ children being forced to do sexual acts?  What are you referring to? Never heard about this
t1_dtnjl6l	1	*	Aside from the other comment, UK and France were very close to bombing USSR because they were supplying Germany with oil:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pike
t1_dutgygy	0	*	i understand it was meant to be a placeholder, but i find it hard to believe the only information they had was explosion. though today better safe than grossly over-exaggerated. 
t1_dta2voq	1	*	Thanks for spl checkU0001f602
t1_ds3s9rq	0	*	War is possible at any time if given the right circumstances.
t1_ds3n9pu	0	*	Don't you feel it coming?
t1_dtxdyrj	1	*	Dems are the party of the liberal rich and identity politics comes second. Buffet, Bezos, Gates, etc all Democrats.
t1_duo5ini	1	*	Well, at least as funny as cracked reactor on the ocean floor can be.
t1_dsq004u	1	*	Oops
t1_dti7ju0	0	*	Stop bombing civilians and labelling them as enemy combatants, for one. Thanks Obama
t1_dthp4uc	0	*	Then there is no reason not to use nukes.
t1_dti348s	0	*	They weren't *being* terrorists, so much as giving terrorists (Bin Laden) a place to hide.
t1_dtiaiky	1	*	Hes mr Darth-Vader Fanboy-San
t1_ds82h91	1	*	You misspelled leeches...you spelled it allies.  Pakistan has done nothing for us.

t1_dsl0aog	1	*	I don't mean to sound bitter, cold or cruel  but I am, so that's how it comes out. - bill hicks
t1_dslrg0k	0	*	Trump: Damn you Obama!  Obama: damn you bush!  Bush: uhhh
t1_dt1bxt8	1	*	Yes - if you witness a crime being committed (like theft or assault), you can make a citizen's arrest. Owing money does not fit into that category.
t1_dsxpsbb	0	*	I was thinking more about Air America. 
t1_dshga5p	0	*	This is a very reasonable answer, one that requires in depth discussion.
t1_dt7zjb5	1	*	This is very true... In fact UK police only discharged their firearms 7 times in 2016. Totally different situation. 
t1_dt86xc2	1	*	It's a small island, you probably can't go anywhere without people seeing you anyway.  
t1_dt81h7y	1	*	Or crime could actually be up.

t1_du48qax	0	*	Do you like David Foster Wallace?
t1_dv7gm7n	1	*	Defense industry on both sides making money of fear. Nobody referred to population majority on both sides.
t1_dswid4b	1	*	I look forward to his continued roasting for the EU parliament.  He can't do that if Britain isn't part of the EU.
t1_dtcxuis	1	*	If ynet reported it then it most likely has happened. 
t1_dtd3633	0	*	Hamas doesn't run the West Bank.
t1_dtd52ch	0	*	Never said that.... nice strawman though
t1_dtd1knv	0	*	Two lopsided political agendas does not a very good argument make.
t1_dse42gq	1	*	Absolutely, big problem is the researchers seemed to just be looking at death statistics, which never tell enough of a story to actually get anything but assumptions from 
t1_dse79al	0	*	well that'd make sense, but given that testosterone levels are rising in females wouldn't that more or less indicate that their cheating ways are kinda dying? hahaha 
t1_dse8973	0	*	***prepares to open can of worms***  Why is chess ;)?
t1_duwrl8x	0	*	Or in case of Germany, people posting mean comments online.
t1_duwnhec	0	*	Alec only drank on revenge
t1_duwutkj	1	*	When you start using catch all phrases for government protesters,  and use the tired old think of the children technique,  you know someone is trying to ramp up the oppression and silence dissent. 
t1_duxuk5y	1	*	You just described Northern Ireland,hehe.
t1_duxtt5d	1	*	Its very ambiguous and its that way for a reason. They can accuse people of different kind of terrorism and its that way by design. 
t1_duwmy62	1	*	He's talking shit, taking kids off terrorists who might turn them into more terrorists has nothing to do with a non-existent invasion
t1_duxbrol	1	*	Roma or Romani is correct, g#ps# and zigeuner are considered to be slurs (at least by those I have met). 
t1_dux25bo	1	*	> Surely....  Please allow me to introduce you to the world we live in.
t1_duwzmun	1	*	> unlawful   heh
t1_duxkygs	1	*	Even if they belong to a far right group, that also doesn't mean they are terrorists. You can be an asshole without being a terrorist, by the useful definition. 
t1_duwhx91	0	*	Every time someone mentions the cost of rehavilitating people who voluntarily went to fight for ISIS I always think, How much is a bullet really?
t1_duwjxz3	0	*	Revolutionary, rebel, anarchist, freedom fighter....  Terrorist just isn't an objective term.
t1_duwxkso	1	*	Adoption agencies might have some idea.  Of course, when adoptive parents turn out to be abusive, it's a big news story, and it makes it seem like there are significant flaws in that process.
t1_duydwnx	0	*	Why not. He's already killed the children of terrorists
t1_duwhv5p	0	*	He's basically saying it's a slippery slope, from terrorist to anyone who doesn't agree with you 
t1_duwbpwx	1	*	I believe it was satire. Judging by the user name at least. 
t1_duwk534	0	*	Not to mention the argument has a tendency to be reduced to eugenics or accusations of eugenics.

t1_du3hwey	1	*	I don't think it's fair to say what about common sense exceptions such as surgery.  If the fasting were something like one a year for one day that would be fine. However it's for an entire month.
t1_du39gv8	0	*	So is drinking soda, eating candy and a million other things. So why pick on the Muslim kids fasting? Why don't schools ban everything that is harmful to kids?

t1_dtq3xjw	0	*	Can you name a few left wing politicians that are anti immigration? Sincerely curious. People are group left and right for a reason and the majority of left wing are pro immigration.

t1_dtq8m75	1	*	Right.  That's what I call selling, not giving.  Tesla is making money on this.

t1_dumnqh1	1	*	Melbourne has a White Night (week?) basically a thing about lights and shit. KFC was packed, employees were busy serving, bins were full, so people left it on the tables.
t1_dumzci7	1	*	True but at least there is rhyme an reason to the US's landfill practices.  In Lagos it's just peninsulas of exposed trash.
t1_dumre5h	1	*	thanks!  now i don't need to read the article :)

t1_dsbdprg	0	*	Mexico starves. Ford Manufacturing jobs come back to the USA like Trump promised.  Like I said, they cant afford a trade war with us.
t1_dsb3397	0	*	It isn't relevant, that's why the US shouldn't care if Mexicans or the Mexican government don't want a wall, do the best for your country!
t1_dsb9y9j	0	*	They know it doesn't, but their voters don't know that, they're told those lies because they need somebody to blame for their problems.

t1_dsb60ka	0	*	Well tell me what you've done?
t1_dsb9o8d	1	*	Thank you. Something that makes me nervous is that center-right people will be criticized for being right leaning at all simply because the GOP and many of its supporters decided to self destruct.

t1_dsb01za	0	*	And to guard it. Otherwise what's the point?
t1_dsbd61b	1	*	that directly contradicted several promises he made on the campain trail?  that's like building a fence around alabama and saying he fullfilled his promise to build a wall on the border to mexico.

t1_dsbg5e1	1	*	This is extremely ignorant, there are so many better ways to handle this. A wall is a complete waste of money, because it will most likely only make things worse. 
t1_dsn3xb3	1	*	They will.

t1_dtbz63g	1	*	Even a cursory glance at a map would help.
t1_dtbp7y7	1	*	That is what I think that Russia wants.  They want global warming because their northern coast is mostly ice. The final outcome of their wants will not be good.

t1_dtx4r7e	1	*	Let's see how long it takes before there is free movement then.    RemindMe! 20 Years
t1_dtxkkjy	0	*	I'd kill to move to Aus, NZ or Canada. Spiders in Aus would be the death of me though. 
t1_dtxg1i9	0	*	But that assumes that no one would want to move to the UK.  I for one would love to work and live in the UK, at least for a decade.
t1_dtxfaj3	1	*	Be careful, the Commonwealth is not as safe as it once was. The gouls are a constant threat.
t1_dtxsphn	1	*	Are we bollocks.
t1_dwi2z8m	1	*	As an Australian Im inclined to say calm the fuck down.
t1_dtxnf91	1	*	Germany vs British Empire 2.0?
t1_dtxcg5w	1	*	Doesn't mean we'll let you stay and/or get citizenship 
t1_dtxd1n7	0	*	Yeah countries we have nothing in common with compared to countries we founded, installed our democratic processes and laws in and speak a common language.
t1_dtxc21a	1	*	Nah mate, what I'm really after is all that maple syrup.  (and a justification for all the hours I put into learning French...)  
t1_dtxlu2c	1	*	Plus the people who think it's Australia without everything trying to kill you. I don't even know that they would have greater net numbers, but proportionally I can't see them not getting swamped 
t1_dtxs46x	1	*	Tons of Brits move to Canada. I know several that would still be here if they had managed a permanent residency.
t1_dtydi8q	1	*	TIL Ireland is not in the UK; in my mind you were already in. I actually have more Irish friends than Scottish, English or Welsh, one more can't hurt. Come on down haha.
t1_dtxj19z	1	*	The outback would become a real life Mad Max wasteland
t1_dtxih93	1	*	>Australian brethren  Please don't come anywhere near the southern hemisphere.
t1_dtxr5er	1	*	The government would have to actually get its act together and sort problems out (like wealth inequality, straining infrastructure).
t1_dtxgriz	1	*	Yeah, but what about New Zealand?
t1_dtxd0wl	0	*	At this point I think most Americans would agree that we should pay for said wall 
t1_dtxf0hb	0	*	I agree with you, but we have a fraction of a fraction of the terror attacks that the UK has. 
t1_dtxrj6i	1	*	Lol, the white alliance is alright as long as we make sure we keep it white. Very good.
t1_dtxe8dc	0	*	Do you know how many of us Canadians would immediately move to NZ or AUS?  Our weather here is the absolute pits 6 months of the year.
t1_dtxpg19	0	*	Heck yea, Australia could definitely do with a political leader who is A-OK with letting in ex Isis fighters 
t1_dtxff0s	1	*	Hey Canadian accents are cute 
t1_dtymy9l	1	*	Yelling at your bossy uncle in law and remains he stop telling everyone what to do is not demanding not to be part of the gang. 
t1_dty7t2x	1	*	NZ has the chillest Muslims in the world. UK has some of the craziest. Oz already has crazies tho and Imam Tawhidi can't calm them

t1_dtx6sjg	1	*	Didnt know that was still a requirement.

t1_dtxcsnp	1	*	Completely understandable, to be fair. 
t1_dty6sm2	0	*	I doubt it, the fact Australia is thousands of miles away is probably a big enough deterrent to stop a mass exodus.  
t1_dtxkd62	1	*	I'm born and raised in New Zealand.  Australia is a lot better to live and work in. 
t1_dtxo71w	1	*	>You blokes form the legs, you bunch of cunts can form the arms, and I'll form the head I guess.   - Queen Elizabeth

t1_dtyv71t	1	*	But ... they're talking about *free* movement.
t1_dtyqobx	1	*	I see what you're saying but I recall that was a different and age and I believe globally we should be moving towards a more united humanity, historically it may be a different story but times change.

t1_dtxmtz0	1	*	Choganecks
t1_dtx9g97	1	*	Raises the average IQ of both countries. 
t1_dty04sj	1	*	> because the UK and the rest of Europe have little in common with each other, they're culturally alien.   No not all. There are culturally differences but they are very small. 
t1_dtxh4d8	1	*	Shit happens when your country has a single word name.
t1_dtxd2k2	1	*	I'm sure some Canadian skiing instructors would be keen to do a house share.
t1_dtxglsa	1	*	What possessed you to write such drivel.
t1_dtxujne	1	*	I'd imagine things are significantly cheaper in the UK as well
t1_dtyi5yc	0	*	Ehh.... 65 million vs 35 mill (Canada) isn't *that* different.  
t1_dtxe7sd	1	*	They could all move to the southern US states to be with their own kind.
t1_dtxd2cc	1	*	man I already know so many people from Canada that have gone to Australia and NZ to work for a year or more . fuck our climate
t1_dtxw0nr	1	*	I'm in Montrxe9al too and I'd move to England in a heart beat if it was easy. 
t1_dtx45sj	1	*	Your cunt quota seems to be too.
t1_dtxcmyg	1	*	We'll always need barmen.
t1_dtd0t52	1	*	I was considering to clean the apartment. But now I can justify my laziness.
t1_dtd0pce	1	*	If only they had a mandatory structural integrity course for their designers...

t1_duwib3j	0	*	Who is? Russia? the US,? Turkey? the Syrian government? Al Qaeda? Al Nusra? Isis? Kurds? Iran? Israel? Hezbollah? Or all the Above?
t1_dswvic3	1	*	You are the first non-religious person I've met to hold this view. Are there ethicists you read with a similar position?
t1_dswu9sb	0	*	Thats just because you're an anti-Canadian bigot. Don't call us Americans. Period.
t1_dsx3917	0	*	theyre banning anti-abortion groups, makes sense to ban both, be fair
t1_dswnjnt	0	*	Must of religious group are banned 
t1_dswq94d	1	*	Anyway heres why Antifa should be a government funded organisation 
t1_dswpr86	0	*	Then literally everything would be entitled to funding, because private entities cannot violate the Charter. The Charter only applies to the government.  This has been the daily pedantry corner.
t1_dswnfoq	0	*	So when is the cutoff for that vague law?  Can a women have an abortion at 9 months? 
t1_dsx5q87	0	*	Sure. And what if there is a communist takeover and babies are sacrificed. The is the law.
t1_dswmtv1	0	*	Haha, yeah totally! It's the principle!! Freedom of speech! Yah!!!!   /s  Grow up. There's no case to be made. 
t1_dsx0pdp	1	*	that makes somewhat sense, considering your brain is full developed at the age of 25
t1_dswu4lf	0	*	Wrong, they lost cases last year and expanded the law against the same groups.  But don't dare call yourself liberal when you deny opinion or assistance for opinion.
t1_dswnay0	0	*	Are you saying Central America is a shithole?
t1_dswq7wd	1	*	What democratic rights is he violating here?

t1_dswpexx	1	*	god -lol! 
t1_dsx0wwo	0	*	You really can't see the difference between being pro abortion and carrying out abortions?
t1_dswm0yg	0	*	Isn't the fetus part of the woman's body until it is born? Or at least like 16 weeks. Just speaking without emotion here.
t1_dswlphf	0	*	So they can state anything discriminatory thing they want, and you'd be okay with it as long as their upfront?
t1_dswpipy	1	*	Exactly, they just updated the terms and conditions. 
t1_dsx0ukv	1	*	Understandable thanks for your valuable insight 
t1_dsxc9q7	0	*	Bullshit. Do you have tolerance for white supremacists?
t1_dswj4z8	0	*	Never said i wanted to, im just pointing out how the world changes
t1_dsxgh5z	1	*	Can confirm, abortion rights in Canada are well protected and most Canadians would like it to stay that way.  
t1_dswszof	1	*	What exactly did he ban?
t1_dsx0fpc	1	*	either way, its canada. he cant just be doing this type of shit but letting all this bullshit trans stuff happen when thats based purely off feelings, trudeau is a moron
t1_dswp65t	0	*	The anti-abortion argument is primarily held by religious groups and the government should not be funding religious groups in any manner anyway
t1_dswlrf6	1	*	I really appreciate your thoughtful response. 
t1_dsxo9qk	0	*	I guess technically not, but why would Trudeau give a flying fuck if he's out of touch with the mainstream population of the USA?
t1_dsw9kyx	1	*	I'm not sure I see your point.

t1_dswms8e	1	*	Then your classified as mentally ill
t1_dsx0hh7	0	*	What part of National Socialist Workers Party, confuses you as to ideology? You misspelled evil.
t1_dswnxh9	1	*	Churches aren't supposed to remain neutral on anything, what are you talking about?
t1_dswovad	1	*	Most anti abortion groups aren't trying to ban abortion outright, they simply don't want their tax dollars paying for these procedures. That isn't even close to eliminating those rights
t1_dswsya3	0	*	Irrelevant question
t1_dsxa3wr	1	*	Lol, what a childish frame of mind. Go build a hut in the woods somewhere then, and live solely off the land 
t1_dswvba0	0	*	I actually can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not
t1_dswu2ts	1	*	Please desist.
t1_dswt6gi	1	*	Wow! Cree and other First Nations made up half of the Canadian population?
t1_dswouny	1	*	That's horrible. I'm glad you had the strength to make it out and keep paying that mortgage.
t1_dswrrot	0	*	Then it's okay for me to go to your house and stab you? You're literally just a chemical/biological reaction when sperm meets egg, after all.
t1_dsx3vr3	1	*	It wouldnt surprise me if it didnt apply to them, he seems to favour terrorists.
t1_dt2ke7o	1	*	You realize, that by being on Reddit... you are actively participating on an American server right? Why don't you log into your own countries version of reddit?
t1_dswmv0d	1	*	Its a grant for summer students, I think almost any organization can apply for it if they have less/more then a certain amount of employees/money. 
t1_dswn9bc	1	*	Ya literally. That's why the state prescribes us rights.
t1_dswrz59	0	*	Actually it depends on the country, most stop at 30
t1_dswpujx	1	*	It wasnt directed towards the article. It was directed towards the other commenters. 
t1_dsy0270	1	*	Sorry, rents due.  No pay, no stay.  
t1_dsxh1ei	0	*	But if it wasn't for Canada, who would Americans pretend to be when traveling internationally? 
t1_dsxcupy	1	*	So as long as your organization's only mandate isn't to repress women's reproductive rights, you're good to go? I mean, pretty much any church is against abortion, but it's hardly their sole purpose. 
t1_dswnxql	1	*	any company hiring for summer jobs
t1_dswu8qc	0	*	What if I told you we Canadians are not Americans even though we are in North America.
t1_dswtwcl	1	*	Since you're over 21 then you're allowed the communion wine.
t1_dswltdq	1	*	No reproductive rights are not in the charter. 
t1_dswf9fp	1	*	 It worked on this guy
t1_dswy26i	1	*	Mainstream America is pro-abortion rights though. It's conservatives that built up a whole industry attempting to destroy it.
t1_dswpz79	0	*	Why should maternity leave be able to cover you living in a bigger city? Make smart decisions and plan your finances accordingly. Taxpayers shouldn't suffer as a result of your poor decision making.
t1_dswr130	0	*	Canada is in America. Canadians are Americans.
t1_dswzzl9	0	*	Isn't that a bit like saying that you're not against marriage equality  because gay men have the right to marry women, just like everyone else?
t1_dswgs4r	0	*	Well, fortunately, you are an american and frankly, after trump, your opinion counts for zip. Now go back to your game threads and leave the adults alone
t1_dsxvv3l	1	*	But an adult can also be in a state where he feels no pain and has no consciousness. Should we be allowed to end their life based on that? 
t1_dswwqtj	1	*	It when the reason the tax rate is so high is because of these types of payouts.
t1_dsx0dg5	1	*	sure but these backwards-ass hillbillies in America are demonstratably wrong. They just push the idea that my ignorance is as good as your knowledge, cuz this is 'muhrica.
t1_dsylzrz	1	*	ok.
t1_dswrfvx	1	*	Your presumption that there are no rights on the part of the fetus to consider is an ideological one.

t1_dswdcor	1	*	You might want to look up the definition first
t1_dsx5jyi	1	*	I don't believe any religious organization should get any money, but that's not the law. If the Islamic groups advocate positions inconsistent with the charter they should not get funding.
t1_dsx82mu	0	*	>  things I don't like  Are you American yeah? My god this is some embarrassingly infantile shit...     > our democratic rights!    You have a democratic right to receive tax funds?

t1_dsx24g3	0	*	Lol. Freedom of speech isn't protected?
t1_dswndmn	0	*	Not according to the law being discussed. They would have to lie on the form and say they were not pro-life.  I'd highly suggest reading the article before commenting with misinformation.
t1_dswmuf7	1	*	The funding is meant for churches or religious groups, it's meant for everyone. The seperation of church and state is very important, which is why this type of rule is fine imo.
t1_dswl384	1	*	According to the article? Any who don't follow the rules for the grant, not hard to figure out.
t1_dsyu5ny	1	*	It is for some people. Very much so 
t1_dsxclh2	1	*	So stupid or snark? can't tell.
t1_dswwvka	0	*	What are you loling about? Communist takes money via tax out of people and giving it to only his favorit groups. Is this funny for you? 
t1_dsy1q09	0	*	Pro-life is pro-women. Pro-abortion is anti-human. 
t1_dswmrm2	1	*	This is standard small-l liberalism. Your right to swing your arm ends at your neighbour's nose, and all that.
t1_dswzfla	1	*	American victim complex 
t1_dswmav5	0	*	Why should any group pushing any ideology get any funding in your opinion?
t1_dswv99a	0	*	How would banning abortions be discrimination? Do anti-abortionists think that men should still be allowed to have abortions but women shouldn't?

t1_dupw7da	1	*	I doubt you're russian as you've misspelled Ksenia's last name in very non-russian way. 
t1_duohil3	1	*	Can't argue with that one 
t1_duo0lrj	1	*	If Safchak wins he'll just be in a mysterious automobile accident the next day. No need to worry, Putin came in second!

t1_dunkedc	0	*	my account is 20 minutes old, and another one is lasted 8 years. You realize why, don't you? 
t1_duol91v	1	*	He's a fucking Hero
t1_dsjm5dh	1	*	Sure, but first action always seems to be to start recording.   Gotta get that 15 min.     That said, you are 100% right.  It's appalling.   But look at how people treat each other nowadays.   
t1_dtppidy	1	*	Ah, a proponent of the Ready, Fire, Aim philosophy I see. 
t1_dtq5753	1	*	In the case of BPA, itd look like a U-shaped curve.  Not unlike this: http://endocrinesciencematters.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NON-MONOTONIC.jpg
t1_dtq0prb	1	*	Element
t1_dtqhqiv	1	*	What about BPF or BPS? 
t1_dtpm6ef	1	*	That's how they introduce the xenoestrogens to maintain the gay-frog-baseline. But if you don't jack it and take some alpha brain, you can beat the Obamacare mind control and see the world clearly. 
t1_dtqcxjf	1	*	We live in a world filled with trace amounts of carcinogenic toxins. But I suppose you're correct in that this study is still deserving of consideration. 
t1_dtpxmc2	1	*	shit.
t1_dtq6soh	1	*	Thermal printers are also one of the most reliable printers out there as well.
t1_dtqjo1i	0	*	We, my workplace, export to Canada, but it's in BPANI cans. So imports also have to follow your rules.
t1_dtq08a0	1	*	and they are.
t1_dtqi3mr	1	*	Just the plastic parts, then you'll be safe.
t1_dtqdoxe	1	*	That bathwater eventually hits the ocean.
t1_dtrn7h3	0	*	It's just using BPS instead. Which is just as bad.
t1_dtpu5fh	1	*	Huxley would be proud.
t1_dtqjdwl	1	*	Thank you
t1_dtpqtmn	1	*	I'm sure the information is available somewhere but I don't know. I'm not in manufacturing. From what I can find, the trade off for no BPA in your can is a higher price. 
t1_dtpxw1t	0	*	Whats funny about that?
t1_dtpvw72	1	*	/r/conspiracy 
t1_dtpy03k	1	*	I mean those could also be explained by the fact that you won't be disowned for *coming out* as gay anymore (or at least that's less likely)
t1_dtpzs30	1	*	Electrical engineering major trying not to fail chemistry right now, and I totally agree with you because something about equilibrium and k constants never being infinite
t1_dtq0s90	1	*	This is what we call Business Friendly Language in america. 
t1_dtqblr2	1	*	No but people typically consume far more plastic bottles than food containers.
t1_dtpwnbx	1	*	probably because there is no safe alternative other than just not using plastics.  the world just aint ready to ban plastic, although it would certainly help with pollution too.
t1_dtpvh88	1	*	How is he a corporate apologist when he literally says he's glad that companies don't deliberately quiet health hazards more than they already do?
t1_dtq21e7	1	*	I don't know how you could possibly construe his comment as a defense of BPA.

t1_dtpxu4y	1	*	Shes is certainly kooky. 
t1_dths8j7	1	*	That's how people are feeling for sure. 
t1_du49kkq	1	*	Yeah, I'm wondering what justified this article... Seems pretty pointless. 
t1_dtdo21i	1	*	I dunno man  It seems like hamas could murder a dozen israeli civilians in cold blood and some people in this subreddit would be happy about it  Hmmm.... U0001f914
t1_dtcr32f	1	*	sponsoring brutal dictatorships around the world! 
t1_dtd8qjq	0	*	There's a difference between a life or death split second response and a pre-meditated assassination from a drone strike that kills surrounding civilians.

t1_dtd95y3	1	*	did you mean to add an /s to the end of that, and just forgot?
t1_dtcrjbn	0	*	is that true ? i always thought fe the RAF counts as terrorists
t1_dtctg6e	0	*	Haba LeOrgecha, Hashkem LeHorgo 
t1_dtcwvdp	1	*	Since most of the assassinations were pre-emptive, and can be seen as acts of war, there is no justification.
t1_dte46ez	1	*	You're right, of course, the bible is completely irrelevant.    Religion is not necessary for a program of murder as active as this one to be morally reprehensible.  
t1_dtdafys	0	*	I thought you were kidding but upon looking it up it was some 638 times.... CIA clearly had way too much time on their hands.
t1_dtcujp0	1	*	Just checking, but you're similarly opposed to US drone strikes, right?
t1_dtd9vor	1	*	That statement goes both ways, though.

t1_dujmoov	0	*	Or not; they have now, at least, realised that being free is better than being part of Germany's empire, and from the Continent I applaud them for that.
t1_dufup9o	0	*	Actually in Islam rapists are killed. It is a lot less lenient than the hippie leftist liberal laws. 
t1_duf4fgq	1	*	It is fair. Fuck child rapists, molesters, abusers, and murders.
t1_dukuof9	0	*	No its a simple risk vs reward thing.    Ur laptop or phone u used to post was likely built by impoverished child labor in a sweat shop.
t1_dtqkzxy	1	*	Naw, just a healthy bit of hyperbole, but I mean it would be absolutely insane if Turkey attacked US troops and **didn't** lose it's NATO seat.
t1_dsez0nc	0	*	What's that sub ?

t1_dsex4fd	1	*	True. Sad, but true. The world sucks sometimes.

t1_du383pn	1	*	That's not pushing. That's lifting. 
t1_du674dj	1	*	The US is a lot less attractive then it was before. The main reason for that is that the rest of the world got a lot better. So make of that what you will. 
t1_du6dwpn	0	*	Come to Canada instead.  
t1_du69tn1	0	*	Meanwhile, in Germany I can go to universities like LMU or RWTH Aachen where I only have to pay 300 euros per semester.

t1_ds385x3	1	*	Protestors don't overthrow regimes.    Revolutionaries/rebels do.   You can't have it both ways, is what I'm getting at.  
t1_dt5dtlk	1	*	Wait...  I thought nothingburger was a euphemism for huge career ending scandal.  
t1_dthmeer	1	*	> women have never been safer in society or more fairly treated  Considering it wasn't even 100 years ago that women were considered the property of their husbands, that's not a massive bar to clear.

t1_duali9f	1	*	I can be your friend but you gotta say #Nohomo after it.
t1_dubdz1y	1	*	Iran cannot attack Israel. What would happen if they win? They get the privilege of witnessing the Samson option along a moral victory?
t1_dualnne	0	*	Putin knows Iran has no intention of actually attacking Israel.
t1_ds2xrgu	0	*	I imagine this varies from surgery to surgery. I imagine the processing of *cancelling* requires are phone call to the potentially confrontational and rude receptionists.
t1_dud2nsx	1	*	The indictment isn't what Mueller says.  It's a grand jury's determination based on the evidence that these crimes were committed.
t1_dujgsz5	0	*	Israel will protect itself - its not a matter of having moral ground.       Israel was created by terror and the problems with its creation is still relevant today for the Palestine people. 
t1_dukezhc	1	*	I always get news about Iran and Palestine from timesofisrael.com or jpost, doesn't everybody?

t1_dtd7j7e	0	*	Yeah first when 15 Saudis bombed the twin towers it was Afghans and Iraqis that had to pay, now when litteralry ISIS is a Sunni terrorist group it's somehow supported by Iran? Exactly my point. 
t1_dskgno4	1	*	Funny. 25C is around where a nice day starts to feel too warm to me. (I live in Minnesota in the US.)
t1_dsv4ido	0	*	Nobody is for sure. All we can say is there are plenty of US troops stationed there, but Im not really Nostradamus when it comes to predicting the worst of this chapter of the Syrian War.

t1_du4krwr	0	*	Clickbait be clickbait, what can you do?
t1_du4x3ya	1	*	It should be law. We needa stop working to death and give labor some edge.
t1_dsou8ra	0	*	This. I doubt it has anything to do with religion, it's likely just money.

t1_dsiw13x	0	*	I doubt there's much, if any, money involved.
t1_dsizdac	1	*	How much tax money do you really think it's wasting though? Also, it's a local change that would use local tax dollars.

t1_dtp1kwu	1	*	Its just excuses to justify bad decisions. I eat like a king and feed myself and one other person occasionally, and I eat so cheaply its ridiculous.
t1_dtpbn8m	0	*	I realise the pointlessness of this given your username, but *maybe* most people don't tie their self worth and masculinity to dietary habits...

t1_duhmrgv	0	*	It is anti nn, it's why India didnt let facebook in
t1_duhfv22	1	*	But why? If they discontinue the internet almost every big brand is losing money.. No more google, yahoo, or even geocities? omg
t1_duhd248	0	*	So it's about preferential treatment and net neutrality.  Make access to the Internet easier, and wikipedia is a part of it anyways.
t1_duhc7uf	0	*	You can see how the 2 are linked though right? This is a good example of neutrality harming people.
t1_duhu6e9	1	*	Could you give me a TL;DR on the author's name?
t1_duie4gn	1	*	So facebook?  We're in facebook now?
t1_ds68bwk	0	*	What chinese terrorists?
t1_ds62pg8	1	*	Most people probably hate Pakistan more than the US. Harboring terrorists does a lot to a countries image 
t1_ds78q3c	0	*	Like China is going to go to war with the US over Pakistan... that's hilarious.
t1_ds6ig80	1	*	Russias economy is smaller than some states. I think India can be swayed. 
t1_ds68xgv	1	*	Should have invaded Iran instead of Iraq.
t1_ds61d1p	1	*	well, the US shouldn't have been in afghanistan to begin with, so
t1_ds7vkxu	1	*	Especially when that ideology was kill all non muslims.
t1_ds6cre5	0	*	Serious question : what are the consequences for being officially labeled a currency manipulator. 
t1_ds635ld	1	*	maybe we would've invaded some other middle of nowhere country  maybe even pakistan.
t1_ds6uvds	1	*	If you believe garbage headlines like this.
t1_ds6550v	1	*	Irak also has barely 40  million inhabitants, compared to Pakistan's almost 200 million 
t1_ds68dsn	1	*	It might have ended a decade earlier. Thatd be nice.
t1_ds6ekch	1	*	Hopefully it would have involved us leaving way sooner or not showing up in the first place.
t1_ds6tdsh	1	*	Indeed Pakistan is a terrible ally for USA, and yet they are one of our best allies in the Middle East.
t1_ds7ewsv	1	*	Fail! We occupy japan lol show me government of japan protesting.  Korea you do know there has been no peace treaty. Might want to get a history lesson!
t1_ds6belz	1	*	There are plenty of reasons to hate the lieing, sex offender, bigot. We don't need to make up more. 
t1_ds61at2	1	*	Iraq is definitely more stable now, and the world a better place. Thanks America
t1_ds6gbel	0	*	Why antagonize India and why not choose India despite so many years? I have never heard any argument in favor of India. Or any other asian countries for that matter.
t1_ds6agou	1	*	Probably would be going much better if we just used drones and long range missiles, with no troops on the ground.
t1_ds70qcq	1	*	Why're you linking something from 1971? The US fucking india over wrt Kargil, Pokhran etc in the 90s would have been more relevant

t1_dt3levw	1	*	Depends on the kind of muslim. But yeah overall that person's comment was stupid and clearly just intended to be inflammatory.
t1_durgzep	0	*	Still an asshole and most likely ate people.
t1_dshcyz3	1	*	That is not true. Keeping rotten fruit together with other fruit will actually spoilt the lot. Rotten fruit gives of chemicals which hastens the rotting process of nearby fruit. 
t1_ds894nc	0	*	Idk if I read that correctly but did you just ask me if I *dislike genocide?*
t1_du2glao	1	*	Yes but that is not what middle defense is meant for. Its to stop rouge states or terrorist who have few weapons. 
t1_ds7keyd	1	*	Sure
t1_dtvktt7	0	*	yet  
t1_ds3k0q0	0	*	Actually the shitty situation is related to many factors imposed by the west.   The decades long sanctions do have their toll on an economy.

t1_dtg4ft8	0	*	Love the mad old sod
t1_dth0dm2	1	*	Think about how much economic damage these ridiculous protests do.
t1_dtgsouh	1	*	Exactly.  These people (Brits and Americans) are so excited about protesting against Trump that they are missing the bigger picture. What if no state visit slows down the trade deal?
t1_dtgw98h	1	*	After Diana died, he said he would have fucked her, but only if she had an aids test first.

t1_dtg738y	0	*	Ha!   I was definitely not in favour of receiving Trump at all but I might warm to the idea yet.

t1_dtfvvx9	0	*	Sorry mate, no horses allowed on the motorways, for you it'll have to be farm tracks 
t1_dtim4ly	1	*	I mean if that's an option. Been there a few times and I think England would be better off with more farm land.
t1_du7o49s	1	*	He wont go.  Theyll compromise and hell keep on stealing, but in a slightly different role.  I hope Im wrong.
t1_ds52mb6	0	*	Overstating the obvious there.  Where'd the uptick in homelessness come from considering the rise in employment?
t1_dtmecmo	1	*	Democracy
t1_dtnrdxh	1	*	If there's a small majority and lots of evidence of Lies and deceit then I would hope they would run it again to make sure our democracy hadn't been tampered with. 
t1_dtn8n7l	0	*	Democrats don't care what their constituents want? Interesting.   
t1_dto95cr	1	*	I can only assume it's hidden agendas at work.
t1_dtnehe5	0	*	Salted butter. It's a pretty common thing. Saw that in the US and Canada.  And fuck no cauliflower, I hate it.
t1_dtn607k	0	*	If the onlyproblem is the number of immigrants, making the country less appealing financially and highlighting native xenophobia is a fine strategy.
t1_dtnjs9t	1	*	Thanks for your explanation.
t1_dtn9tqc	1	*	> At some point, we have to accept that a majority of the population is favorable to Brexit  I think that point came and went some time ago.  These days I would say a majority is for staying.
t1_dto2i81	1	*	> Now i'm not sure people thought about it that much.  Pretty sure that people who voted leave did know that it would come with a cost, this is just remainers/pro Eu press saying we told you so.
t1_dtng9g0	0	*	as a Brit, its sounds really weird. but honestly, salted butter. there's something about it.
t1_dtnhe8h	1	*	Retainers are just giving you people the benefit of the doubt that *maybe* you werent so fucking stupid you would knowingly shoot your own country in the foot. But obviously that is not that case.
t1_dtoe468	1	*	Absolutely. This is why Nigel had to lie about the NHS.
t1_dtmwvo3	0	*	Ok, thanks for the info.
t1_dtn5o1l	0	*	Instead of debating the point of his comment you're trying to decredit him by pointing out the fact that he doesnt know the difference between england and britain

t1_dtmpgwn	1	*	Hey you! Yeah I'm talking to you lady! You have a 53.4% old bitch index rate! 
t1_dtn43e4	1	*	Isn't it called racism? Brexit and Trump are two sides of the same coin. It remains to be seen whether they are the last gasp of institutional racism or the end of liberal democracy. 
t1_dtny2g6	1	*	Who said anything about white? I have full faith in Brussels ability to fuck over a country using any part of the color spectrum.

t1_dsql164	1	*	The vast majority of BLM activists I've ever met or heard from would not support segregation of colleges.

t1_dt8htt1	1	*	Wow? That long ago.
t1_dtcr3j5	0	*	Regardless of what they use it for, the irony is pretty palpable.  A popular food of the sustainable eating movement is what is causing irreparable damage to Mother Nature.
t1_ds9pbgw	1	*	We just need an infectious marketing campaign
t1_dsahk4b	1	*	Well, yeah, which is why this isn't particularly newsworthy in my opinion. Not the trend, I mean, but these expert opinions.  
t1_dui28mv	0	*	A place for major news...

t1_dv0h7wz	1	*	We're smarter than this.
t1_dv15wkl	1	*	Alternatively, they can put the embryo in a plastic cup like those Japanese people did with chicken embryos.
t1_dud3d0r	1	*	Well, yeah its a dickish thing to say... but Mao killed about 10 times as many Chinese as the Japanese did. And that was *after* the war.
t1_dubyah5	1	*	That happens to the best of free radicals.
t1_ducrukc	1	*	Huh, and you're talking about propaganda. Ironic...
t1_duct2mt	1	*	> boosted the gdp/capita by over 500%  Ah yeah you're right. Now what are we going to do about all this data that says otherwise? https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp

t1_ducov9t	0	*	Well... there are actually a shockingly big bunch of people who actively deny that the holocaust ever happened..   People are just stupid, man.  
t1_dudshex	1	*	The massacre in Indonesia is taboo because the CIA was complicit in it. They supplied the listst with names of (alleged) communists knowing full well what was happening.

t1_dung6cv	0	*	our house, our rules.  when we're in their country, we can follow those fucked up islamic rules. we had those too in the middle ages, so it's kinda retro.

t1_duo086a	1	*	> Zelanian  WTF?   If you can't think of the word to describe any group or area within New Zealand just use Kiwi, it's pretty universal.

t1_dsyk7bz	0	*	That's different though, that was taxpayer money being spent on it, which is directly related to the budget.  Immigration isn't very related to the budget.
t1_dsyki3d	1	*	Exactly.   **My** representative is good. It's all the other ones. 
t1_dsygguj	0	*	Yeah, it's one of the flaws in the US political system. I do support supermajorities for big issues though. A much better alternative to minority rule!

t1_dsyjpav	0	*	They were literally holding kids (ie. CHIP) hostage.  EDIT: Also, Trump is at 40% approval rating and he lost the popular vote.   What are you talking about?
t1_dsyjreb	1	*	Then it is on Republicans to negotiate and get support. If they can't do that then they suck at governing. 
t1_dsyi21n	1	*	they started spinning even before the shut down. republicans didn't pass funding for chip, then tried to spin it as if the dem's wont vote for the budget because they don't care about chip.
t1_dsyk7q7	1	*	Dad joke... But I dig it
t1_dsypuz9	1	*	Oh that makes sense. Thank u !!
t1_dsykdj9	0	*	In what way?  The Great Deal Maker has been shown to be totally and completely incapable of compromising or finding middle ground, an important skill in a democracy and in deal making in general.

t1_dsxr8ed	1	*	Its cool, a few downvotes from some mouthbreathers isnt a big deal. Its all imaginary internet points anyways.
t1_dswe4m1	0	*	Awesome! I didn't know that. Chur bro. U0001f44d
t1_dswqpgc	1	*	Haha, you're a funny guy.
t1_dswtvhf	0	*	Dont you guys have a Govenor General or queens rep that is basically your head of state, similar to us in Aus?
t1_dsws59v	0	*	I'm kind of amazed that Pakistan had a female head of state before the US.
t1_dswg516	0	*	I'm inclined to believe them. Know any cheap vasectomists? 
t1_dsw2d18	0	*	Apparently she's said Winston will be in charge for six weeks
t1_dswgfey	1	*	And also, her partner loves fishing.
t1_dswdlf5	1	*	>I think this is great opportunity to show that you can be in a high power job and be a mum  We already had Jenny Shipley. Look at how long she lasted...
t1_dsw52cz	0	*	Gender hasnt been an issue we have had 2 female prime ministers in the past. Age has been the biggest talking point as she is only 38 but shes got a good resume.
t1_dsws4gc	0	*	I can't tell if you're messing with us or not
t1_dsxo3cs	1	*	To add on to this, how many heads of government are raising a baby/toddler? Generally their children are older than that, often even grown.
t1_dswrvhu	0	*	Well, not really. NZ'er here too. She'll be not working for 6 weeks and a human gets born. That's pretty much it.
t1_dsx8lzc	1	*	Because we want a society where men and women have equal opportunities. 
t1_dswa4e7	1	*	I'd be worried for the kid because running a country is not a low-stress job.  Edit: down-votes for saying that stressful jobs are not good for maternal or fetal health?  Y'all need some education.
t1_dsy05e3	1	*	AKA Foxtards
t1_dsy0ymm	1	*	Did he carry one any of those kids to term while he was in office?  Downvotes won't change the answer to that question.
t1_dsxiqvj	1	*	and he eats for two
t1_dsw8o54	1	*	Probably created by assholes like yourself who would never accept that a just wage gap could ever exist /o\\
t1_dsw5435	1	*	There's been a few gross moments from men, but overall it's been pretty chill. We've had two female PMs before so it's not like people can say it'll be the end of the county.
t1_dsxzvdn	1	*	We've already dealt with this.  The last guy to correct the person who made your observation got a hundred upvotes.
t1_dswyi8v	1	*	His haircut makes him look older though

t1_dud1ftq	0	*	Do you really think there would be less shootings if a fully functional gun was provided in every class room?
t1_dsztite	1	*	Ehh, humans live in all climates, these antelope previously lived in just one.  Now, there's probably a few nasty bugs lurking in the permafrost...
t1_dumto9m	0	*	this needs to be said so fucking much! Party politics should be teamwork from different perspectives, not a sports match where you root for your team no matter what.
t1_dunl6ti	0	*	Well tbf Austria doesnt have much wait to sling around, when was the last time they made international news?
t1_dun2ldc	1	*	Something tell me, migrants won't be able to pay a 3000 fine
t1_dsqgovf	1	*	Aerofloat is very poorly run and only does well inside Russia. They should be a major global airline but they aren't. 
t1_dv3yvo1	0	*	What he's saying is people are going to marginalize this as one guy and nothing to do with anything but one guy, so it's not really a thing. 
t1_dv48lcg	1	*	I agree: Children should be free to have any kind of religion that they want, and free to have any kind of sex that they want. 
t1_dtkpuhu	1	*	Overblown and taken out of context, for sure. It being a touchy subject, feeds on people's emotions and they are quick to jump to any conclusion before understanding the reason behind it.
t1_dtla7pf	1	*	Yes, I do think there is a difference. Which is why I say as much in my post. Not really sure what this comment is trying to say tbh.
t1_dsv3wjk	1	*	It's amazing how many people don't seem to comprehend that fact.
t1_dtyqvzt	0	*	will be shocked if he wasn't downvoted into Bolivian by the  open-minded Redditors
t1_dszxown	1	*	She should have gotten 20-40 years for being a traitor to the united states not a slap on the wrist. 
t1_dt0o24i	1	*	I love how worldnews is filled with whiteknights who never had pussy and think by acting like a whiteknight it will help them get pussy. Lol.
t1_dt6noc1	1	*	Well, US and a lot other countries list PKK as a terrorist organisation. There is a big difference being a political group and a terrorist organization.
t1_dtdwgsm	0	*	Will you not please say what the democrats has done in the last 4 years that rivals this? God knows I am not a fair of either party but one is surely the lesser evil.
t1_dtdlksy	1	*	It just has to do with more or less all the horrible things the Trump administration has been doing in general.   So, no, not just Russia.
t1_ds5gc66	1	*	Unfortunately, doing this will cause the following:  1)2nd holocaust.
t1_dugvt3d	1	*	:( I had just got Reddit when I posted that comment
t1_dtpuc2c	0	*	Youve been lied to.  bCash is a centralized fork of bitcoin.  It is trash.
t1_dtc1rwe	1	*	I fear you are too right.
t1_dsnagg3	1	*	yeah, that'd be a real kick in the arepas
t1_dsn02dl	1	*	I don't know, lancashire hotpot can give boeuf bourguignon a run for its money.
t1_duuskbq	1	*	And even if it did, cash donations are a very temporary solution to a much larger problem. This takes a lot more than money to fix.
t1_duuzegl	1	*	births + immigration < deaths + emigration  
t1_dv41kfa	1	*	I knew Tony Garza when he was the ambassador, but Obama's career diplomats kept a lower profile.
t1_dsv5jov	0	*	Sweden had no crime then immigrants and then crime?  Really?
t1_dussror	0	*	You should, someone could get killed because he's too slow to react.
t1_duttsgw	1	*	I think it'll be a good 30 years before I can buy a cheap used fully autodrive car on craigslist.
t1_dutna3q	1	*	You should write down his licence plate, call the non emergency line at your local police station and tell them your concerns.
t1_ds7hb4a	1	*	Eating dog meat is certainly a niche in Korea and Canton China but these dogs they are eating are closer to pigs.
t1_ds7dzs9	1	*	Than pigs?!  Fuck that! 
t1_ds8dxez	1	*	Only if dog meat is not part of their main diet
t1_ds7j6x6	0	*	That's incredibly stupid and simplistic thinking. 
t1_ds7lzds	1	*	AKA the scum of the earth
t1_ds79nsf	0	*	We also ate dogs when we were domesticating them.
t1_ds7sfm8	0	*	Would you eat human, or an endangered/species like the siberian tiger?  All or none.
t1_ds7jbj0	1	*	Pigeons and goats were domesticated before dogs, and goats have many of the same cognitive bonds with humans.  You just weren't raised with them as companions the way you were with dogs.
t1_ds84c79	1	*	Ya but these are American stats, when the story is about Korea.
t1_ds7k66h	1	*	Tfw you hungry af but trippin bout the Prions
t1_duvwxgn	1	*	Dealers worth pursuing aren't doing their own shit usually. 
t1_duw8r4f	1	*	Yeah, I see this. My question wasn't meant to be a question and more of a statement. 
t1_duw0na1	0	*	What are you asking me? 
t1_duw635s	1	*	Des lo vult!
t1_duw0dtj	1	*	When you break it down to a moral question - whos really worse, a weed dealer or a company that extorts sick people with a 2000% price increase on critical drugs?
t1_duwb07j	0	*	> There's a solution. America isn't ready for it, yet, but there's a solution. We all know what it is  Legalization?

t1_duw4bpm	1	*	Putang ina mo
t1_duw3yan	1	*	To be fair if it was an opinion Trump would have tweeted it by now...
t1_duw8t3h	1	*	This is no longer consumer demand, it's just propaganda at this point. 
t1_duw43g9	1	*	Is that Tillerson-Rex?
t1_duwbff6	1	*	The democrats aren't trying to decriminalize any kind of opioid. No one is. 
t1_duw7y0j	1	*	Tough shit, bro.
t1_duw7hvm	1	*	Or might have *become* a junkie. It was for their own good.
t1_duwa3fu	1	*	I think it's more of they don't care about baseless, unsubstantiated, and biased claims about something their President *allegedly* said.
t1_duvunrl	1	*	judging on how he can barely hold a cup of water i'd say the former
t1_ds21h30	0	*	Yeah no. They're probably just going to push them off to Jordan at this point.   It not apartheid i don't know why people keep trying to make the comparison.
t1_ds3o0jj	1	*	one state first, then work on suffrage. pretending that there will ever be 2 states is worse than useless.
t1_ds2hnkv	0	*	Really? Tell me, where does it say Israel plans to take the entire WB?
t1_duba9t0	1	*	She wouldn't react as she always looks like she's dead on the inside. 
t1_dua9jpi	1	*	Very true lol
t1_ducoyoi	0	*	Fake news at it's finest.  China's Security Czar backstabbing China to release coup details to NK Dictator. It smells of pure bullshit.
t1_dsz8m24	0	*	> Restaurant Brands International.  No those are franchisee starbucks in some places. Usually RBI/HMS at the airports, Aramark at universities. 
t1_dt0imm4	0	*	Starbucks is twice as expensive. 
t1_dszq0ec	0	*	I figured the false equivalence was expecting low wage workers to turn on the government, which is looking to stop their exploitation, because the exploiters told them to do so.
t1_dszjz62	1	*	donuts and timbits used to be warm and soft. you knew they were made on site.  now they're hard, cold and stale.
t1_dszv5ok	0	*	Communism doesn't solve the problem of human greed!  *proceeds to ignore and inadvertently reward human greed*

t1_dsgtuj3	0	*	Somalia =/= Somaliland.
t1_duc3hvd	0	*	Orangehead didn't even know how to pronounce Namibia a while back
t1_dt86sqh	1	*	9/11 wouldn't have much to do with that. The Taliban has no nukes. 
t1_dt86d0g	1	*	And then other nations retaliate with _their_ nukes.   It's called MAD for a reason.
t1_dsjt8ov	1	*	It's not just Trump though. No politician answers the questions that are asked in debates, and that's a big part of how we (should) choose.
t1_dsjdkd9	1	*	I just find it humorous that they're grilling him (pun originally unintended but fuck it) about supposedly burned politicians while he, a politician, is so close to a fire :)
t1_dsjahc0	0	*	Maybe they learned Spanish from Peggy Hill :)
t1_dsjejhc	1	*	As an American I do not. I didn't vote for the current crop of losers.
t1_dsjarji	1	*	How do you ensure that both sides are the same and treated as equals then? Aren't all random opinions of insane people treated as equally as valid as supported science?
t1_dsjh3at	1	*	If you start paying attention you'll notice Christian bumper stickers (fishes, crosses) once in a while but that is as exotic as it gets. 
t1_dsjjg4y	0	*	That's right, only Dutch civilians were burned with acid since even arabs won't bite the hand that feeds them.
t1_dsjav76	1	*	Our country in a nutshell lately
t1_dslbm1u	0	*	I would like to see the video he was shown. That sounds stupid. 
t1_dsjq25s	1	*	Sriracha?
t1_dsjgtmj	1	*	As a Belgian I love how honest the Dutch are. They just say everything that comes to their mind straight to your face.
t1_dsjy9l8	0	*	Nail meets head and only two upvotes (one of which is mine).
t1_dsjenil	1	*	....Huh?
t1_dsju7n3	1	*	It is. Good eye for comedy.
t1_dsjf971	1	*	It also fits.  I'm just a caveman, but fuck THIS guy. 
t1_dsk8nc3	1	*	It's really not that bad. It's more a temporary image problem than anything permanent.
t1_dsjddyx	1	*	Conservatives work very hard to be that disengenious and I am sure this person does not enjoy you pointing that out.
t1_dsjh8r2	1	*	Yeah go to a heroin-riddled trailer park in West Virginia and tell everybody how lucky they are living in the greatest country on Earth. 
t1_dsk8fus	0	*	anti trump mob ofc ?
t1_dsjmb1f	1	*	This isn't anything unique to the Netherlands, the U.S. just has an exceptionally feeble media.
t1_dsj7xf1	0	*	Dicks also fuck assholes, Chuck.
t1_dsjrudq	1	*	Many more issues, but the electoral process doesn't help. Trump lost popular vote by millions. Our stupid electoral college gave him the election. An outdated system in need of changing.
t1_dsisphg	1	*	You all obviously don't Twitter in Dutch, there were some sick burns flying in the last election 
t1_dsjg2fo	0	*	No but they hated him because [he was Witt.](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moord_op_de_gebroeders_De_Witt) 
t1_dsj9wm9	1	*	We are ALL Dutch on this blessed day :)
t1_dsjoc95	1	*	What has Trump done about any of that?
t1_dsj9xtm	1	*	This is depressingly accurate.
t1_dsjgkyj	1	*	Ehm, no, a lot of people think they showed him the recording, but they did not. The Nieuwsuur reporter clarified this on twitter himself.
t1_dsj8ru4	1	*	As a Dutch I say don't. 
t1_dsjcpf2	1	*	Honestly, it just makes me want to live in the Netherlands. The truth is the truth, so why beat around the bush?
t1_dsj8039	1	*	Secret's in the sauce!
t1_dsje6e8	0	*	what!? how the fuck are we so far down the list?? It's way worse than I could have imagined 
t1_dsjl18b	1	*	Because he doesn't want to be criticized for Apologizing for America. American machismo requires detachment from reality.
t1_dsjbg3a	0	*	Because he's either a Russian troll or a great fan of whataboutisms, or both.
t1_dsjeb6g	1	*	It's not rude, it means you have a spine. There is no need for hostility between the media and government but they shouldn't be chummy either. The media is trying to get information for the people. 
t1_dsjkpxd	1	*	Aussie reporters can be fucking ferocious at times too:    https://youtu.be/Tc5ljcri6Nk
t1_dsjbw6c	1	*	Are you okay mate? Need to talk about something? You seem angry.
t1_dsjanjw	1	*	From the Donald supports on Facebook and Reddit they are saying this is the first time in forever that America is respected. They are living in an alternative universe
t1_dsk92tg	1	*	I don't understand. *account? This is my only account
t1_dsjetfk	1	*	That and american talkshows are just impossible to watch when you are not used to the style of reporting.
t1_dsjabtj	1	*	Lived in Holland last year. Your Dutch directness was entirely at odds with my British nicities. 
t1_dsjmc1b	1	*	But we DO arrest drunk Russian ambassadors beating up their kids at home...  Edit: spelling
t1_dsjqgs1	1	*	Tiles on walls are irritating basically?
t1_dsjivk6	0	*	>risks having your access cut off  The fact that the politicians control who can ask them questions is a major problem. 
t1_dsja93m	0	*	He [tried](https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/943991312570822656) that first. Someone could probably get a lot of karma if they make a good reaction gif out if it.
t1_dsjd7fu	1	*	New York Times. 
t1_dsjzyed	0	*	What do you mean?
t1_dsj82ce	1	*	There's only 2 types of people I can't stand. Those who are intolerant of other people's cultures...and the Dutch.
t1_dsj9ee3	0	*	Rude? Hold the fucker accountable! That is hardly rude, its pretty much his job description. 
t1_dsjonti	1	*	I don't think he was looking blankly at the wall. He was reading the quote on the fireplace which is even more comical.
t1_dsjhitg	1	*	We can start with the NYT and other outlets calling Trumps lies as lies, not just repeats falsehoods.
t1_dsja0sf	1	*	I found it pretty refreshing when I was there.  I'm not a fan of people who are full of themselves and spout bullshit, and neither are the Dutch.  They get right to the point.
t1_dsjq4v8	1	*	In Mexico, doesn't that make him the man in charge of hugging everybody?
t1_dsjaqxl	1	*	That's how it should be here in the US. Especially when it comes to journalism. 
t1_dsjbjyh	1	*	> ANSWERING QUESTIONS IS WHAT FASCISTS MAKE YOU DO  -- Trump supported
t1_dsjt20y	1	*	It's not just Americans. I know a lot of people from outside the US that are so anti-muslim they'll believe any story as long as it paints muslims in a bad light
t1_dsjtvql	1	*	correlation not causation. Access to large quantities of cash and poor cognitive functioning are both correlated to heavy cocaine use during the 80s. 
t1_dsjpxsf	1	*	Does suck but you do have to hit the opposing arrows full screen button and it then goes away.
t1_dsj80gz	1	*	It's just words though, our reporters needed a BBC reporter to finally call out our own populist Geert Wilders on his nonsense.
t1_dsjkpms	0	*	>Admit you screwed up and apologize like a normal human being  some people see that as a weakness. seriously.
t1_dsjau85	1	*	That's how people really should be
t1_dsjb4vl	0	*	I just assumed he really likes spicy food.
t1_dsjg85w	1	*	As an ambassador, so did Hoekstra. 
t1_dsjav84	1	*	I hate how people think they can't call out someone's bullshit because it's not polite.
t1_dsjqhrr	0	*	I think that is. Imagine trying to keep track constantly about the millions you are taking in every month from 10 different sources. You too would lose track of your thoughts mid speech.
t1_dsjmdtg	0	*	Am American, am very ashamed and embarrassed 
t1_dsj6kme	1	*	I didn't notice a look on his face, but I did notice that he didn't answer a journalist's important question. 
t1_dsj7txy	0	*	Yeah hahaha. I didnt catch that. 
t1_dsj9fso	0	*	He sure had a bunch of pregnant pauses when the Dutch press flummoxed him with their questions. 
t1_dsjxm0f	1	*	Can he just be send back already. I mean he already fucked up way to much...
t1_dsjkjhz	1	*	Oh trust me, as an American I gladly appreciate you guys forcing our scumbags to the wall. You have no idea how much this clip made me smile, and filled me with pessimism at how bad our media is.
t1_dsjbjaq	0	*	Isn't that around half then? Close to it, anyway.
t1_dsjxuc0	1	*	Not really mean since that was entirely my point.
t1_dsjj8tt	1	*	And yet some Americans still think they have it better concerning freedom of speech and press than for example Germany where Holocaust denial is illegal. 
t1_dsjqj5f	1	*	I have seen one saying if you can read this, you are too close. Which made sense becauze tailgaiting is quite common. 
t1_dsjc7o1	1	*	Brand them with the Golden Arches and feed them to Trump.
t1_dsjef1w	1	*	what if the moon was made out of politicians, would ya eat it then? i know i would... heck id go back for seconds
t1_dsji90m	1	*	I don't blame you for what you do. Babushka needs her cabbage, and somebody has to pay the bills. Just remember to pray for forgiveness before you die from malnutrition Vladdy 
t1_dskejof	1	*	He made both statements at the same time, just saying he wasn't completely wrong. It's only fair to admit he was partly right if we insist he's partly wrong.
t1_duyi762	0	*	And what? That makes it ok?   What you describe is part of the reason why so many people can't write for toffee. Monkey see, monkey do.
t1_duzk76b	1	*	Time for Hadrian's channel?
t1_duyn2ry	0	*	I feel as if they should suffer like he rest of us. 
t1_duynqx1	0	*	Pity we're likely to get the worst of both systems instead of the best of both
t1_dt1w7ik	1	*	I find it filled with socialists
t1_dt1vqze	0	*	The only racism ive seen coming out of SA lately is from the EFF.
t1_dt68hix	1	*	>she saw mandela as a terrorist  That's because he was. There's a reason he went to prison for all those years, and that reason is planning terrorist attacks.
t1_dt20673	0	*	Saudi Arabia?
t1_dt4reqa	1	*	It would be some session
t1_duycza6	1	*	Ok thats a fair point tbh
t1_ds75afq	1	*	Just about any method is safer than cigarettes.  Although vaping is better than most (not saying it's healthy or anything).
t1_ds6xz7w	0	*	There is considerable evidence that the Solanaceae family of plants already contain nicotine (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, etc.).
t1_ds6xczx	1	*	Yeah, they haven't been able to use the word light to describe any cigarettes for like 8 years now.
t1_ds70tv1	1	*	me too! good job! keep it up!
t1_ds73lyi	0	*	its more like the US government approach acknowledge and dismiss.. then they have the lucha libre characters aka repubicans/democrats fake fight eachother. 
t1_ds70pok	1	*	nail on the head!! 
t1_ds7moie	1	*	Keep going man. 
t1_ds6p4nx	1	*	Yeah lol. No one calls them that though :)
t1_ds6thnu	0	*	The people of Sokovia beg to differ.
t1_ds7ytf0	1	*	NZ is definitely up there. Literally the biggest difference I noticed in my day to day life after moving from NZ to London was the number of smokers.
t1_dsm4z5s	1	*	>Hope is nice. Fucking useless in this situation, but still nice.
t1_du07hi5	1	*	Youre one of those people against kneeling too huh? The olympics have always been about politics. 
t1_du037lk	1	*	Lmao that's what I'm thinking. Doesn't look a thing like him. 
t1_du02xjr	1	*	What does Sarah Jessica Parker have to do with anything?
t1_du02zd9	0	*	I'd say that Trump and Kim impersonators getting along and posing for pictures also supports the idea of peaceful coexistence, and is not the sort of thing that ought to be kicked out of the Olympics.
t1_du0alfq	0	*	Meh, not enough stank on the stankface. He needs to look more like he's coming to the realization that he is alone after farting in the elevator and there's no one to be miserable from his handiwork. 
t1_du05w54	1	*	You should take 5 seconds to to Google East Asian Freedom of Speech and see what pops up.  Also I like your username. 
t1_du01uvz	1	*	Wim Hof would like a word.
t1_du0jh58	1	*	It would only need to be rephrased if the intended audience was all stupid or bots.
t1_du091a3	0	*	Nah hes getting downvoted by trump supporters. They are downvoting any comment in this thread that thinks this was funny. 
t1_du0o6u0	1	*	First the flash, then the shockwave
t1_du05rpd	1	*	>What's with the Musk hate?  an inevitable situation risen out of the Musk love lol
t1_du0zerk	1	*	Wow, I expected sarcasm. That IS pretty good.

t1_du0ey5p	1	*	> It's really not that difficult to refrain from shoving politics in people's faces at such an event.  What politics?  
t1_du0jyf1	1	*	Everything you just said is wrong. Haha.
t1_du0f2em	1	*	They trumped it.
t1_du0lrax	1	*	Apparently people need math symbols added to their text and an explanation of PEMDAS to understand titles.

t1_dugj4rj	1	*	> I've never said sleeping with you was very entertaining.  I am sorry for you. That's sad.
t1_dueqz1a	1	*	Good info, ta

t1_du50qn8	0	*	But what happens when the negative press **is** the truth? People get into the notion that anything negative about a party is a conspiracy against them. Sometimes, people just suck. 
t1_du5awhw	0	*	Its working in almosr every country.
t1_dus95qo	1	*	What are you going to do about it? No one thinks it's normal, but seriously, give me one reasonable policy that you think can prevent what happened?

t1_dura650	1	*	Yeah still though, you guys really should try and add to ammendments to update them, or at least change the name so it's less ironic
t1_dur9roz	0	*	But it was written with amendments.  To amend means to change. It was written with an included process of how to change it.
t1_dusan0w	1	*	People have short fucking memories. 
t1_dut7mj4	1	*	So you dont think the 2nd amendment should exist? 
t1_dusfdyv	0	*	That sounds reasonable to me, though I'll have to argue the case of a lever action rifle U0001f602

t1_dudr5b5	0	*	But who is  this other side youre talking about? Racists? So either racists were faking these or leftists were faking these? To do what? Make people demonize racists? 
t1_dudmytz	1	*	You can usually tell by what they say. 
t1_dudqr5t	1	*	It was right wing voters, not the GOP leadership, that put a man into the white house that claimed that thousands of muslims were dancing on the streets of new jersey during 9/11.
t1_dudqgjm	1	*	Technically. Wakanda doesn't exist in real life, but it's depicted as being in Africa.

t1_dua6u8f	0	*	Gee how many others recognize the genocide which assisted the Nazis in killing the Jews? While I don't agree with the denial, no one has any right to single out Israel
t1_dua3ymg	1	*	You have no idea about geopolitics and I have no time to explain to you how wrong you are.
t1_dua7lt2	1	*	He is saying because they are Jews they are responsible for things that never happened, like the Palestinian genocide or that time he found his dignity

t1_dsus83x	1	*	They retracted the story. People lost their jobs. This does not invalidate everything they ever reported. You do realize that don't you? You are capable of critical thinking I would hope.

t1_duzvdh8	1	*	Bing it and you tell me 
t1_duzh3hc	0	*	I feel that he gives away so many nicknames that its always funny if one resurfaces. I didnt realize there was a movement though, kinda like how Trump took the Deplorables moniker to heart?

t1_dsen34s	1	*	Have you seen Trump's deposition tapes from 2016? He seems a little less insane in those.
t1_dsesu79	0	*	He can either have the power of office or the protections of a private citizen - not both at the same time while he publicly commits crimes on a daily basis.   
t1_dsetupi	1	*	Because it's US politics, which is against the rules.   Besides that, he's getting potentionally impeached since 1 year now and it gets annoying.
t1_dsezync	0	*	Great argument. He's a shitty president because he just is mate. Because other people say he is mate. Duh.  
t1_dsfp3my	1	*	They aren't trying. Lets be honest, there is no way Trump sits down for a unscripted interview under oath. Unless Mueller has a subpoena.

t1_dserj2l	1	*	Actually made me laugh with that one.
t1_dseoex1	1	*	No, Trump's lawyer would belittle the other side of the table for even pretending like this was a real investigation, as opposed to a political witch-hunt. Perhaps even stage a walk out.

t1_dunjcy2	1	*	And what are the bags made of? Sounds like greenwashing to me. Plastic bags are still plastic.
t1_duncbfq	1	*	Or you could, you know, handwash them properly. It isn't very hard.
t1_dund80i	1	*	I have a bad habit of immediately chugging whatever drink is put in front of me. Straws help mitigate that. That said, I usually use a tumbler with a reusable hard plastic straw, not disposable ones.

t1_dtu7r7m	1	*	Saying they don't want him to do the interview because they know he lies all the damn time is pretty hilarious though, because he'll perjure himself on the most innocuous questions.
t1_dtub3tj	1	*	To clarify I'm not condoning the lawyer or our malignant narcissist President's actions. I hope that fucker goes to jail and god willing I'll pop champagne when he does.

t1_dtu4eqb	1	*	Yup. Trump supporters and conservative bystanders alike voted for him in the primaries, and again in the general election. This problem is their fault. 
t1_due4gv3	1	*	Sorry but all that sounds expensive and we have bombs to build for our next war. Also, you're missing the real point of voter ID programs: restricting eligible voters from the polls.
t1_dv3g0js	1	*	The article is supposed to inform that a violent act had taken place. Not to show off the reporter's knowledge of kick type.   
t1_dt7ajx9	1	*	Yeah, June 7th.  [Ontario provincial election date 2018 - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2018) 
t1_ds6wzgc	1	*	To be fair, basically all of these came out as atheists after they were running for office.

t1_ds7s2bm	1	*	Everyone's always saying Save The Earth. The Earth will be fine a few thousand years after we're gone minus nuclear waste. Save The Humans should be what we're saying instead. 
t1_ds7jetw	0	*	Yes, the great liberal conspiracy against aerosols and refrigerants...   Man, Rush Limbaugh is such a tool.
t1_ds7lmww	1	*	Acid rain is still a problem in some places like china, the ozone was a global problem.
t1_ds7m28z	1	*	Yeah that makes sense. If only these industrious homegrown Americans could be open to the idea of training from petroleum based work to other forms of energy. I doubt that skills are that different.

t1_dsfspgd	0	*	Im sorry, even though i agree with you, isnt it bad for a wild animal to be closed in a small area? I mean, sure they live there, get treated and whatever, but the space doesnt drive them a bit crazy?
t1_dskz4sm	1	*	So you're saying that guns are the reason we don't have socialized medicine or college? Because I can't see any way that people owning guns prevents people from wanting or voting for those things.
t1_dskn814	0	*	you do know that people used to spend their money on ridiculous business trips and expenses not to pay those taxes?
t1_dskrs9d	1	*	This comment seems somewhat serious, so I think this is a whoosh moment...

t1_dssj8et	0	*	that gave you this stupid website, and your stupid internet, and the stupid computer on which you see it. 
t1_dssmqqm	1	*	Now is not the time for sleep! Merkel's trolls are ubiquitous and incessantly active.  They never rest.  We must be equally persistent in rebutting their lies.
t1_dssz6af	1	*	Probably feels relatively the same except your ears and nose would get frostbite slightly faster than -50.

t1_dst7u3c	1	*	Damn, if the temperature reaches 20C in Australia I feel cold. I don't think I could cope with 3C weather. I've never experienced minus weather either and I don't think I want to.
t1_dst84az	1	*	Is it possible that Russians are so antagonistic just because of the shitty weather? 
t1_dst1025	1	*	Interesting thought.  There's very little air on Mars, so the thermal heat from your skin wouldn't escape as fast.  I wonder what the feels like temperature would be.
t1_dsse2tx	1	*	Belgium here. We had some wind and I was moaning about the lack of rain.

t1_dso0ce8	1	*	Can confirm, but I live in Sask, so it's kind of expected, unfortunately.
t1_dso2bxc	1	*	Yeah well, the UK didnt have Jesus and George Washington standing side by side creating the perfect future proof framework for the best nation.  /S

t1_dso36il	1	*	The issue is. This are the type of people to run for government and people will vote for them in local elections cause barely anyone runs. 
t1_dsnw1xk	0	*	So a person in your country waving a foreign flag you disapprove of angers you enough to ignore their citizenship and call them cunts?

t1_dsnv83k	1	*	TBH, what else is a man gonna do.
t1_dsnwz7h	1	*	They cited the Magna Carta so youre probably very right 
t1_dso0p06	1	*	What happened to Magna Carta, did she die in vain?
t1_dsnw12j	1	*	In the video when the audience was cheering on the police for arresting the protestors - the protestors erroneously believed it was for them. They waved back at the crowd. 
t1_dsnyp3d	0	*	Oh, sorry, does it offend your delicate sensibilities?
t1_dso2vnr	1	*	I once had a bloke tell me that he doesn't want to be a minority in his own country. It honestly doesn't occur to these people that it's not their country.

t1_dtmj7aj	1	*	You have it backwards. Mother Nature doesn't deal w Asia, Africa because they are poorer or more downtrodden than Europe. Asia and Africa are poorer and more downtrodden because of Momma Nature.
t1_dtx9ia3	1	*	The word is dictator.  Confusing a dictator for the country they rule is endorsing them, and that's not journalism.
t1_dt493uk	0	*	It makes me sad that this is downvoted. Reddit is so xenophobic sometimes.
t1_dt37o4u	1	*	How about a man in arab garb trying to sell oranges out of a bombed out building?  Or Israeli soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder and holding guns?
t1_dt3eud2	1	*	Yeah but they're not refugees.
t1_dt3xl2j	1	*	Well you better be willing to except more than 100 million new citizens in the west, if gdp/capita of 615 USD and below is your criteria.

t1_dt3avyn	1	*	I think there's a distinction between the oath enlisted take (swearing to follow orders), and the oath officers take (to defend the constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.)
t1_dt3dp9w	1	*	unnecessary comment. they already covered that with   >they can be kind, they're just people   
t1_dt328zg	1	*	Yes they are. They may not be risking their jobs, but they are risking being targeted by right wing politicians and have their names dragged through the mud.
t1_dt380iw	1	*	If the government of Israel is stating either deportation or indefinite imprisonment, what happens to the refugees that the pilots refuse to deport?
t1_dt39bf7	0	*	Backing this up; a friend from college was from there, escaped at night across the land. This was 30 years ago and Eritrea is still a horror.

t1_dt37awa	0	*	The one reddit made up. I mean, do we have to trot out the old argument over and over. If Israel is committing genocide, they're really not trying very hard.
t1_dt360e0	1	*	you should be condemned.   edit: /s
t1_dt38wqy	0	*	God damn. That is so eloquent and impactful. I really hope more people hear what that pilot has to say. 
t1_dt31klz	1	*	Aside from the moral issues its probably pretty dangerous to fly hundreds of people to their death.

t1_dt3pler	1	*	Yeah... no.
t1_dt3md90	1	*	I got downvoted quite a bit.   At 0 now.  There are some, and not a small number, who are proud of what Israel is now.  It's quite disturbing that people can lack such empathy, isn't it?
t1_dt3lvr6	0	*	And its mostly the CONSERVATIVES that are treating asylum seekers like animals. Its a fucking disgrace, yet those conservatives feel absolutely ZERO shame for what they have done 
t1_dt3juvj	0	*	I find their immigration policies even more ironic when they were colonized via deportation then being indefinitely imprisoned upon arrival

t1_ds6hk8g	1	*	Genuinely curious, how was Trump's message taken by a citizen of Pakistan like yourself? Do you think he's right/wrong? If he's right do you think he's justified in his stance? 
t1_ds6dyv2	1	*	Which is insane and the idea that private property can turn into public right will have dire consequences.
t1_ds6fqyr	0	*	If Facebook were deleting every gay persons profile then that would be treated in a similar issue I am guessing. Otherwise a poor choice in whataboutism.
t1_ds6fmha	1	*	I mean, a school teacher in USA was fired this week because he gave students copies of renesaince paintings and some of them showed nude acts.
t1_ds6ewhn	0	*	>We need to figure out what the internet means to us and what it should look like, and then make laws according to that ideal,  How about we keep laws to a bare minimum for once. 
t1_ds6rt4k	1	*	Whats funny is that I see the same people fighting for Facebooks right to censor opinions but also fighting for the NFL players right to protest while on the job.

t1_ds39mwo	0	*	Yes, yes it did.
t1_ds309ts	1	*	The problem is you have nowhere to go up in the air. At least on the ground I have the option to run from something.

t1_dt9t2hw	1	*	>I don't believe he wants to literally commit incest.  I know people who've done incest. It's not a huge leap to assume someone wants to do it.

t1_dub2nbw	0	*	Uhm. The US ist currently the biggest illegal EXPORTER of guns to mexico.
t1_duyfzcr	0	*	Only thing that works against that is strictly on topic moderation. 
t1_duyapeg	1	*	If a country has United in its name, very likely it is anything but that.   Looking at you Scotland.
t1_duxhttp	1	*	> Chinese shilling on Reddit is definitely overstated.  Your point? Everything on the internet is overstated. 
t1_duyhjlz	1	*	Small correction/question: Im pretty sure Kim is the family name, Kim Jong Un is his full name and Jong Un is his full first name
t1_duxdi26	1	*	Any country with Kingdom in it, definitely not a kingdom either. 
t1_duwt6e4	1	*	>soyboy   Well, you've established your inability to research or do anything beyond parrot what other cool internet losers say, so I guess you're definitely right about everything.

t1_duy85wt	1	*	OP's right, we've came up with so many alternative names and analogies for the recent event, it's quite entertaining.

t1_dv0bub0	0	*	I mean, this is clearly not an average situation. Shops will not lose a lot of business by not catering to people working 60+ hours a week.
t1_dv1bfgb	1	*	>  It was miserable. I've managed to tone it down to 70 hrs a week these days.  Still sounds miserable. Do you work 7 days a week?

t1_dsnte4e	1	*	Assange is a hero, the kind of guy who would stand against nazism even in 1939 Germany, but because he exposed the usa he is a propagandist, that is so wrong. 
t1_dsoczzu	1	*	It's nice to see I downvoted that post way back then.
t1_dsntxe1	1	*	It's funny because I rewatched TDK last night and thought of his opinion on Super-Sonar thingy with the same context.

t1_ds1bhw3	1	*	A lot of comments are absurdly upbeat over this statement. For Kim, aggression can be redefined as he feels necessary.
t1_ds16vhl	1	*	Propaganda exists as much in the west as it does elsewhere. The news conditions us through language distortions and mis-framing stories like that.

t1_ds1dqrm	1	*	Or how about just the Norko people? We just let them suffer? For some reason people dismiss their human rights violations, usually because they just feel like calling Trump a war mongering idiot.

t1_ds1h2bh	1	*	So once per year, not every month. 
t1_ds16h6v	1	*	Yeah, I really don't think the Kim regime wants to start a war. They want to survive. They give up ALL leverage the second they fire first, so they're just not gonna do it.

t1_dtoduk7	1	*	Yes, but just like the cold war; it will take a President to finally tell you to fuck off; then you'll learn your lesson.  Everyone can get along fine without stupid bully tactics.
t1_dtp0vtn	1	*	Big city Canada and Rural Canada are almost entirely different cultures.
t1_dto893o	0	*	Puppy?  You've never seen a hockey fight?
t1_dto09uj	1	*	Nah. If it is the commonwealth and USA vs the world, the world doesnt set foot in any allied territory. The combined navy and Air Force would be impenetrable. 
t1_dtoo66j	1	*	> conducted illegal mineral and oil prospecting in our northern waters  Haven't heard about that.
t1_dtocg58	1	*	As a Canadian, the people that have been the rudest and snarkiest to me on Reddit are people from my home town. I'm sorry that we have assholes in our country too. Sorry.

t1_dtoa6r3	0	*	Ah, the batic. Which NATO promised not to take as members.
t1_dtnx760	0	*	Russia and NATO aren't friends, but that's no reason to unholster your gun first when you run into Russians right off their own coast. 
t1_dtobxzw	1	*	Well, you did have it coming trying to invade and all. Granted, we were still a British colony at the time, and it was just part of your larger war with them. So... No hard feeling, buddy?

t1_dso86ql	1	*	Apparently we have no right to criticize leaders, who apparently are godlike manifestations of their national populations, which makes them deserving of blind adoration. /s
t1_dsogoiy	1	*	US has little reason to get in deep with them anyways. If they try for independence Assad will attack them. And last I checked people were opposed to trying to depose of Assad.
t1_du87qss	1	*	As a business owner, I paid it for years. I wish you'd been around to explain to the ATO that my employees were meant to pay it rather than me.  You may be thinking of income tax instead.

t1_du90jwc	0	*	So you think it's fair that the giants mentioned in this article don't pay the  taxes as smaller companies?
t1_du899c0	0	*	So you reckon Apple has legitimately invested / spent $22b in Australia, and not run losses as a result of complex transfer pricing arrangements to minimise tax?

t1_du8q026	1	*	It's funny how a bunch of people try to argue why that would be a bad idea and how they explain how it's not possible to work while in reality businesses spread get taxed on revenue.
t1_du84u3j	1	*	Yeah its really bad in those 3 countries. I live in Ireland and work for a multinational and Im betting my company doesn't pay many taxes, if any 
t1_du879cn	0	*	Perhaps you could enlighten us on how? The article has very little details on why each of these companies aren't paying tax.
t1_du85ko3	0	*	What are you trying to say? That's the buisness doesn't have to pay tax because its employees do?
t1_du8bt7r	0	*	Considering 35%+ of Australia's budget is welfare and is only touchable by those who pay virtually no taxes who also expect the same services as corporations, yeah.
t1_du8erjv	1	*	And also politicians in Germany are proposing tax cuts, because we need to stay competitive with the US. It's so depressing...
t1_du83d3x	1	*	Great read! Thanks.
t1_du85n8e	1	*	To Americans, Liberal in Australia is Economic Liberalism, and not social Liberalism that is the more prevalent term in the USA.
t1_du8a0ll	1	*	Because revenue is different than income
t1_du7yaol	0	*	I thought you guys had a very limited campaign season with spending caps on campaigns that could be a model for the US. What went wrong?

t1_dt543uz	1	*	Username doesn't checkout.
t1_dt5g8g2	1	*	Tariffs offer protection, but they increase prices domestically and you need consumers willing to pay. The US hasn't done a good job of incentivizing switching to solar so it will be a challenge.

t1_dv2omdk	1	*	Bernie Sanders is anti trade though. The TPP had environmental protections which would basically make the Southeast Asian companies play by stricter rules. As for wages, that didn't happen with NAFTA.
t1_dv2nsor	1	*	ha, thanks.

t1_dv2q1sl	1	*	Shit, they found out that we were trying to send in our moose army by hiding them in steel shipments!
t1_dv2rx03	1	*	Because CNN has proved that with their year and a half coverage of the Russia story. 
t1_dv2onh6	1	*	You clearly haven't seen the chain of command below him. It could get a whole lot worse than Trump.
t1_dv2rn4f	1	*	Well the problem is that people are voting against the interests of the people they don't like, regardless of whether it's good for them.

t1_dv2v3nd	1	*	Being a republican I guess.
t1_dv2q0yx	0	*	National security doesn't even come into play. Trump doesn't think in those terms.  You need to ask who does Donny know that will benefit from this, and how does Donny benefit in return?

t1_dv2jen1	0	*	There isn't realy any spin or scope for spin either. They are reporting a thing that was said and a response that happened.

t1_dtuezft	0	*	Something about freedom of the press I suspect, but there really should be standards even for a free press, misleading or outright fake news isn't really that much better than state-controlled news.

t1_dtudtjo	0	*	As far as I can tell there's a group of ultra-conservatives that believe enjoying anything that they don't enjoy is against their religion. There's no other way to explain their behavior.

t1_dtugc90	1	*	We need legalized production and sales.    We need to know if the weed contains sugar or the cocaine meth.   This leads to safer consumption and better informed users.

t1_dv64yma	1	*	The Thing is: Right now China is way more predictable.
t1_dv52g5t	0	*	Ummm, you might want to look at reality some time.  Unemployment is at an 18 year low and the stock market is breaking records.  
t1_dv6s34f	1	*	It is only bad if the US is protectionist.  :/
t1_dv6h8lv	0	*	China would fuck itself by withdrawing all US Treasury Bonds. They can only do it gradually or not put new money into US Treasury Bonds, which Trump will need if he wants to finance his tax cuts.

t1_duwae9d	1	*	It doesn't keep being the kids. 
t1_duw1n3q	1	*	The mean is increasing, but so is the standard deviation.  A forced nonlinear dynamical system typically becomes more chaotic when the amplitude of the forcing increases.
t1_duw0ssc	0	*	Youre so in my head.

t1_duwdkbe	1	*	Well cool. I guess what Im asking is if the effects of human are accelerating the process, which kind of seems like a no brainer to me. But the ice caps *are* supposed to melt right?
t1_duwh9f9	0	*	Definately do your own research. If after that you hold the same rather aggressive viewpoint as yourself, so be it. There are many of us that do not.

t1_dtkqcqj	1	*	Well, in the russian one, the problem was more that the farmers were already dead.
t1_dtluk5t	1	*	Say what you will about W, but this is definitely a saying now, and will one day become an old saying. People in the future won't even get the joke. 
t1_dv33908	1	*	Reddit works in mysterious ways 
t1_dtalzot	0	*	Is it as fraudulent as the Russian collusion conspiracy?
t1_duui6ge	1	*	Friedrich I, Peter the Great. The emperor of qing banning opium because people were dying to it.

t1_ds6iik7	1	*	Well it's not Bannon's book so...
t1_dsbs2bx	1	*	Yeah, and thats all church garbage.  Not stuff youd really hear from a person who got nailed to a tree for telling everyone how great it would be to be nice to each other for a change.
t1_dt2lih1	1	*	Im American you can tell it to me
t1_dt2r36f	1	*	Santa is real in here. <3
t1_dt2qap0	0	*	So we're basically just a bunch of Asholes and Birches?
t1_dt2mbe7	1	*	 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/why-so-many-icelanders-still-believe-in-invisible-elves/280783/    Yet they believe in invisible elves?  
t1_dt4eklh	1	*	How many elves have you spotted?
t1_dt2nccp	1	*	Yeah
t1_dt2jxdd	1	*	This is kind of funny... 
t1_dt48him	1	*	They polled people aged 18-70 (iirc, at least from 18 yeard old)
t1_dt2jilw	1	*	Odin!
t1_dt2eaa5	0	*	I'd wager there's at least 1000!
t1_dt2lzup	1	*	To be fair, that's what most Christians believe science is saying.  We just sorta started as random monkeys and became human one day, that's evolution.
t1_dt2lzk2	0	*	And after slaying Ymir, Odin, Vili and Ve set about making the 9 worlds with Ymirs corpse.  Fucking metal
t1_dt2p59w	1	*	Maybe they're so religious that saying the bible's creation story was fake WAS the joke answer.
t1_dt3icw5	1	*	Except Islam is actually growing in all parts of the world. Dont know why the downvotes when what I said is true and not bad
t1_dt2skij	0	*	young earth creationism which says the earth is less than 10k years old was started in the mid 20th century by Henry Morris..   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism 
t1_dt2jcq2	0	*	That's irrelevant. The question is when those 7 days happened.
t1_dt2qqxr	1	*	>My guess is fairly small sample size of those below 25.   [And they only asked smart kids.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868313497266)  
t1_dt2izrq	1	*	If you consider major religions to be cults then most people in the world are in one cult or another, making the term rather meaningless.
t1_dt2kkfy	1	*	Had not thought of it that way- as an Atheist I would have no bias toward any one religion, unlike anything...political.
t1_dt52zke	0	*	They should get busy making more Icelanders. The world needs more of them.  Have you noticed intelligent, friendly people usually have far fewer children than the norm?  
t1_dt2jpzi	0	*	Not stories... Tales.
t1_dt2gbbw	1	*	Probably neither are most older Icelandic Christians.
t1_dt2lmeh	1	*	Yeah, and all Democrats sacrifice the fetus of their first unborn to Stalin because they are Communists who hate America.
t1_dt2mf1q	1	*	They eliminate the extreme outliers in the data for many polls.
t1_dt2p2zf	1	*	On a scale of 1-10, how euphoric are you right now?
t1_dt2puo9	0	*	I don't see how those 2 choices are mutually exclusive. I believe in the big bang theory and God. 
t1_dt2irth	1	*	> it is not the position  seriously, dude? That's such a dishonest quoting, and it's literally *right there* for everyone to see
t1_dt2v2eo	0	*	Do those elves and fairies hold sway over other people's lives? And you know very well what I meant.
t1_dt2m5t6	1	*	Fantastic explanation. Thanks! 
t1_dt2m0cw	0	*	Yeah. There it [goes](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7s6m6e/poll_found_0_of_icelanders_under_25_believe_bible/dt2lv9b/)...
t1_dt2irc1	1	*	Many of us don't need to be told that, in fact most of us probably don't need to be told that. 
t1_dt2jnx8	1	*	Im fairly certain there are passages somewhere that gods time is different than ours - I always assumed thats why it says 7 days but wasnt actually 7 days to us.   Edit: I could be totally wrong
t1_dt2jiek	1	*	Aliens
t1_dt2oezw	1	*	Which still doesn't prove that the events before that happened in literally seven days as a day is also used as an indistinct period of time in the Bible.
t1_dt2m3cs	1	*	That's because the vocal woke crowd thinks anyone who has set foot in a church oppresses women, is a homophobe, ignores science, and thinks the the Earth is 5000 years old. 
t1_dt2m3cx	1	*	This was Iceland, not Poland
t1_dt2nb10	1	*	Two big rocks.
t1_dt2t39w	0	*	So Hinduism is technically agnostic? U0001f914
t1_dt2j0d0	1	*	probably because it's propaganda.
t1_dt2htge	1	*	Yes they are just all muslims because GRATE REPLCAEMENT
t1_dt2o4i3	0	*	Ha, Ireland is a Christian country demographically too,  it's strange how our churches keep closing down from lack of attendence.
t1_dt2j9r6	1	*	I am skeptical of this poll.  At the same time, if you're not aware of how progressive Iceland is, then you're not aware of how believable this is just as a passing anecdote.
t1_dt2mpu6	1	*	At least they care. In the US South, thats not always a deterrent from burying one. 
t1_dt2p288	0	*	I dont agree with the parent comment. I ALSO don't agree with you either. 
t1_dt2v3ft	0	*	come tell me how that works out for you in 100 years
t1_dt2oj19	1	*	Probably helps that Iceland has a pretty small population of only about 330,000 people. 
t1_dt2o9c4	0	*	Be glad he un-friended you.
t1_dt2jhdo	1	*	Yeah. He has to start from the beginning and explain how the hell the Sun and the stars being formed after the Earth fit reality.  I wish him the best of lucks.
t1_dt2l5p1	0	*	100%
t1_dt2n05d	1	*	Tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of Americans would tell you the same thing.   But have fun with your circle jerk-I hope you get off 
t1_dt2pfnc	1	*	Hey I'm an American, and I know it's bullshit... but probably most people where I live believe the bible is a real story. It's astounding.
t1_dt2hxej	1	*	its still a very good place to live overall , even after that recession (10 years have passed, things have improved since it anyway) 
t1_dt2kjrx	0	*	There is none.  Bible also say is a day is a year to god and a year is a day to god (paraphrased obviously)
t1_dt2kbo3	1	*	I wear boat shoes, cargo pants and jean jackets, so nostalgia suits me. 
t1_dt2j0h3	1	*	yes but one should also be aware that the stories in the bible were gathered from stories already been told. it's influenced good and bad is what we should be aware of not just of its influence. 
t1_dt2pyhd	1	*	>Of those between 25 and 44, 77.7 percent believed in The Big Bang Theory  I guess that explains why a shitshow like that still gets renewed season after season.
t1_dt2l0dr	1	*	No, Reddit tells you that increasing the Federal deficit by another $1.5 trillion to give a hand-out to the 1% is bad fiscal policy. Stay on target.
t1_dt2khi0	0	*	you just have to have faith that it has been.
t1_dt2irp8	0	*	He's the mountain in GoT and Icelands strongest man
t1_dt2oppi	1	*	get off your high horse
t1_dt2j975	1	*	Yeah,  Catholics aren't the biggest offenders here either. Schools and school functions host the most and the worst by far.
t1_dt2k4fe	1	*	You didn't get what he was saying 
t1_dt2s98u	1	*	Yes, but that would mean you do not believe in the creation story, which is what the poll appeared to be asking.
t1_dt2jxr0	1	*	Ah yes, the digital Christians.
t1_dt2mnhj	0	*	I went to CCD as a kid, they said it was all literal.
t1_dt2mjwa	1	*	Sometimes called [The Lizardman Constant](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/)
t1_dt2ud9o	1	*	Was there a choice that God created the Big Bang? Belief in the Big Bang should not automatically assume atheism. 
t1_dt33pv3	1	*	Well that's unsettling.
t1_dt3v8l5	1	*	Nope, why? 
t1_dt2qul9	1	*	There are a TON of atheists/agnostics in Scandinavia/Iceland/etc. Especially young people. 
t1_dv1s5vg	1	*	That's what I was thinking, lmfao!
t1_dv1p0co	1	*	Thats a fucking joke too
t1_du01d3b	0	*	Eh, didn't really mean by price. Train is a lot less hassle for pretty much the same travel time. Would even a pay a little extra if the difference isn't that great.
t1_dv4vhl6	0	*	Well the YPG was a far more effective military instrument in actually confronting ISIS. Turkey held back for years on doing anything
t1_dulfslw	1	*	It's not that cold in southern Sweden. Not gotten any snow this winter.
t1_dte692n	1	*	Not his idea
t1_dsp7wlc	0	*	To be fair, the word dismembered does add a bit to the conversation.
t1_dsta7g3	1	*	I don't know about the UK, but in the states even independent contractors have to obey the rules of the company or they get fired.   That wouldn't change the fact that he has her number. 
t1_duy58hu	0	*	I don't mind being downvoted by racists that support the status quo.
t1_duy8lau	0	*	It's not yours or a random commenter on a websites fault, it's the fault of your government. However, if after hearing this you continue to live there, I can only hope for the best for you
t1_dse2m2d	0	*	I missed the part about how they are trying to ban porn. It didn't say this necessarily happened at work. Maybe I missed that. 
t1_dsd7ww9	0	*	Ah, good point. I would hope, at least, that it's behind locked doors or something and not in the middle of a legislative session...
t1_dsd8sx3	1	*	I'm Ted Cruz and I like this post.
t1_dsdaz0d	1	*	God this is a stupid article and it annoys me that it's on the front page.    People in the UK's parliament use the Internet, film at 11.
t1_dsdeme5	1	*	Oh shit
t1_dsd2ck2	1	*	Doesn't have to be an ad. The site just has to call for a resource from the domain, it could be an image, script, stylesheet, anything. It doesn't even have to be used in the page.
t1_dsdbw9t	1	*	By the time election night roles around, its just constant jacking. 
t1_dsd8nui	1	*	\*Starts humming and beating chest in rhythm\*
t1_dsda9j9	0	*	Its, Rules for thee, not for me. 
t1_dsd4cfz	1	*	Teach them about proxy servers and ad blockers.

t1_dtlehyx	0	*	They are treated equally get off your high horse. It's already swung the other way.  The hypocrisy involved with feminism is astounding.   
t1_ds29ck0	1	*	I'd argue that a call for a just govt transcends borders.
t1_ds2k8ub	1	*	Who are dying in the streets fighting against government corruption?  [stay classy](https://sep.yimg.com/ay/stylinonline/anchorman-stay-classy-t-shirt-sheer-11.jpg)
t1_ds2ll41	1	*	Takes one to know one
t1_dupzl3g	1	*	No no no, flukes are an entirely different parasite /s
t1_dupmu09	1	*	Then is there a word other than parasite for something that can but not necessarily display parasitic behavior?  Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_parasite
t1_duq85ht	0	*	Yes, let's avoid studying anything that can harm us. While we are at it let's stop research on HIV and live in bubbles for the rest of our lives.  /s
t1_dupfg4f	1	*	There is nothing left to effect control over the now-empty body.
t1_dupisz7	0	*	Maybe not a parasite intended for humans?
t1_duklxqf	1	*	well, it's all about lowering the convenience of killing people.  because some people don't really wanna kill people that badly.
t1_dsnajaf	1	*	Using coal but not building new plants. 
t1_dsnhiw4	1	*	Actually it's mostly by switching from coal to natural gas as their primary fossil fuel.
t1_dsnt7i6	0	*	This is so completely irrelevant to the topic. Are you really that lacking in attention that you would say anything for it. Go get help.
t1_dsmu13c	0	*	What?
t1_dsnx5h7	1	*	A ban is a joke if there's no authority to force it.
t1_dtbqyky	0	*	Maybe the rhinos help against the camels.
t1_dtd5q9g	1	*	It is what it says. The Chinese have decimated the Rhino population of thousands into 30. 
t1_dseoeja	1	*	The Black Dinner
t1_dschndh	1	*	Fascinating.  Thanks for letting me know.
t1_dsf3cca	0	*	Some people are just born with a dominant left hand. All we ask for is respect.
t1_dse3yd5	0	*	With an unbeatable combo like that I see a bright future for the USofA!
t1_dsd2b26	1	*	Imo it's more about making the US more profitable and better with solar energy. I'd say don't believe anything about Trump not giving a fuck about new tech and renewable energy. 
t1_dsd9nbb	0	*	The problem with steel is they're dumping.  People keep talking about the subsidies and that's an issue, but these companies don't even make a profit right now.
t1_dsdwe6h	0	*	Don't worry, America will remain competitive in clean coal and oil with all the government subsidizing. Chinese government is too shortsighted by putting their money in solar and cracking down on coal
t1_dstirxl	1	*	agree with you
t1_ds63s35	0	*	... that's just so fucked Man. I wish kylo ren was president of the United States .
t1_duwyytc	1	*	Same, and they're growing all the time.
t1_duwaxm9	1	*	Nah they are paying for the icloud service of automation of their backups etc. I dont have an iPhone or apple product but I can atleast see that there is more to icloud than just space
t1_duw4ld2	1	*	I don't think you know how these things work. 
t1_duvvyrf	1	*	IIRC it was Firefox?
t1_dux99mw	1	*	You're an idiot. 
t1_duubo9k	1	*	Disgusting. I would have written the same thing a few years ago. I was just making an educated guess but now the evidence looks like its in. 
t1_duutcwg	1	*	So what do you expect to see as your indicator of climate change happening given your claim that it hasn't? 
t1_duvd0d3	0	*	Are we all dying in the next decade? Or by ice free do you literally mean no ice whatsoever?
t1_duv3vor	0	*	If you read it it says past 60 years, it does not say ever recorded. Which means this has happened before 60 years ago. 
t1_dum796b	0	*	Well we can at least make things difficult for them by taking out some of their revenue sources. 
t1_dt47t1l	1	*	It definitely doesnt! But it doesnt help to spread misleading headlines either, especially when what he actually said is so obviously wrong (and easily argued against, as you just did). 
t1_dt3zdw5	0	*	Clickbate titles do their part to spread misinformation.
t1_dt3x6sd	0	*	As someone who is British and takes absolutely no pride in our country and it's horrific past, I apologise and completely agree with you.
t1_dshchrc	0	*	>We need to stop their kind from telling people who to vote for.  Ban the entire election campaign!
t1_dsgxovt	0	*	The entire establishment is having a brown trouser moment, not just Trump's half. None of them are talking about doing anything remotely useful or effective.

t1_dsbb4cn	1	*	> not that bad  That's quite the endorsement. I look forward to seeing that in future tourism advertisements.  Egypt: It's not that bad.
t1_dsaqoia	0	*	is this some nuance to the story, or do you just want to chime in.
t1_dsbm9pl	1	*	So he's smarter than Einstien, Newton, and Hawking combined?! Either your logic is off or Trumps opinion of his own intelligence is almost accurate 
t1_dsam7e1	1	*	> Atheists are still believers.  That's like saying people who don't give a fuck about baseball are still baseball fans.
t1_dsaqgt0	0	*	Look at all the great it brought all those Arab countries lately, eh?

t1_dtrjai8	0	*	how many schools are destroyed via airstrike in china? Or india? I'd love to hear how many....

t1_dtr1bgi	0	*	Did I not say shithole country?
t1_dtyf8l6	1	*	Well, having parents with higher education is a pretty well established factor into your likelihood of getting higher education too.
t1_dtrjthh	1	*	that's ironic, right?
t1_dttb1ke	1	*	We dont have nearly as strict requirements unfortunately 
t1_dtqwk83	1	*	Umm... Mexico 
t1_dtqu1qk	0	*	Canada is selective about Refugees as well. Generally Families first and Women+Children second.
t1_dtrne3d	1	*	You are a good person.
t1_dtr6sef	1	*	Yeah, but this wouldn't have been posted if it wasn't attempting to relate to US politics. Don't kid yourself that it would. 
t1_dtqf7h0	1	*	> 72% of immigrants have not completed high-school published by Statistics Canada.  Could you provide a link? 
t1_dtrp9i1	1	*	Obviously it's about race, that's why those for open borders are the only ones bringing up race
t1_dtr2oo4	0	*	I believe that diversity is a strength no matter from where it comes from. That's my personal belief though you're welcome to have your own
t1_dtreyto	1	*	We recently had an article with a headline like many 11-16 year old immigrants struggle with elementary school education so that might explain a bit.
t1_dtqk3ot	1	*	It depends where the parents come from.
t1_dtry8v5	1	*	He was the one that did that with his shithole countries/Norway remark
t1_dtr11b4	1	*	By merit he means race not education  An uneducated norwegian has more merit than educated Africans
t1_dtqpjtq	1	*	Of course they do. I'm sorry if my comment may have sounded like I was saying anything like they don't. They, including everyone with any kind of job, are crucial and critical part of society 
t1_dtqwv9n	1	*	That is why I have both a dutch and a Canadian passport. Long life birthright citizenship! 
t1_dtqh0zk	0	*	Come on, this being a primarily US subreddit, the US illegal immigration debate is by default rooted in any article discussing the merits or drawbacks of immigration, legal or illegal.
t1_dtr2l9b	0	*	I mean that comment honestly. I don't mean to stereotype, I'm just speaking from my own experiences. If it weren't true I wouldn't have said it :).  Hope that clears things up 
t1_dtr3etb	1	*	It takes a lot of hard work and faith in your ability to make a better life for a person to move from one country to another. It's not surprising that drive gets passed on to their kids.

t1_dt9su3w	1	*	also these stats are usually by family, the drug-war and feminism really contribute to the inequality per family.
t1_dt9f9kg	0	*	You should be using purchasing power parity for working that out.  Although you do have a point, it's more like the 0.01% than the 1%
t1_dt9mhgw	0	*	Oh yes, back then only the finest, most logical champs of the technocratic enlightenment roamed the intertubes. That was the golden age. *Tips fedora*  Almost /r/gatekeeping material.
t1_dt89off	1	*	>one guy  more like 50
t1_dta1nf4	1	*	Its extremely common among Muslims in Southeast Asia. Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. thats where Im from and I was circumcised as a baby.  They dont normally cut out the clitoris there either.
t1_dt8xo1x	1	*	Completely depends on the type of female circumcision you have.  The one I had is less invasive and painful than removing the foreskin.
t1_dskd1gt	1	*	Good point.
t1_du5152q	1	*	There was no IG for the entirety of Clintons term as SoS. This kind of thing isnt limited to one party.

t1_dujf6u6	0	*	You cant wreck someones knight in shining armour wet dreams.  Theres always a bigger gun.  Theres a lot of it on reddit too. Judging by the downvotes.
t1_du4hrsk	1	*	The key is to stop giving them more data even if they continue to hold on to what they already have. 
t1_du4oyeh	0	*	People caring about internet points is just as much of a cancer. People hold these points as some form of personal validation and it creates a sense of dependency.
t1_du4b7wp	0	*	The shit blizzard.
t1_du4osag	1	*	Yep, they might be on to something.  
t1_du7b35k	1	*	How?

t1_du7jmln	0	*	He won the majority of states by a wide margin, and it's not people who elect the President it's state electors. Electoral College - it's not new, they teach this shit in middle school.
t1_dtsjsqy	0	*	Not the 15th largest, look at the second table. The 20th largest is 5.28% drop, whereas this one was only 4.10%.
t1_dtsgt4i	0	*	Property markets are cyclical and Trumps administration has offered nothing to be optimistic about...unless your Russian.
t1_dtshsfi	0	*	A 10% correction, which is the minimum amount that qualifies as a correction, would be 2,600 points. Its happened with some regularity historically.

t1_dt5xjp1	1	*	Obvious T_D poster is obvious.
t1_dsf750x	0	*	This type of thinking is the problem. If you attack the people without dismantling the system that enables them they have the power to demonize you in front of the world. 
t1_du1753q	1	*	It has everything to do with Trump
t1_dv5c3fh	1	*	What's wrong with Singapore's public housing? 
t1_dsr479j	0	*	Hes a very high profile public official under criminal investigation. Killing him would create way more problems than it would solve. 
t1_dugue6h	0	*	Innocent in the eyes of the law. That means nothing about what the people should believe. People condemn politicians actions all the time without a court conviction (which takes years). 
t1_dug8udm	1	*	They were the ones to violate Israeli airspace.
t1_dugmye8	1	*	You mean to say they are intelligent and Militarily capable??
t1_dufsdsm	0	*	That's a reassuring lie told by the IDF. 
t1_dsyoezd	1	*	This is what I was thinking.  How much money will Trump stand to make in his presidency, I wonder? Putting in work for Corporate America. 
t1_du31siv	1	*	Its how the poor get free healthcare. 
t1_du2j24b	1	*	This joke was old some time ago.
t1_du2avwy	0	*	That a non-sequitur. Expand on why this headline being published 'proves' ops comment wrong.
t1_dsuww7o	0	*	Dude, who the hell cares about Stalin or Nicolas II? Stalin died more than 60 years ago, Russia had like 6 other tzars since then, he's smply not relevant today.
t1_ds2srh3	1	*	I only said it was much better than pakistan. 
t1_duljd1t	1	*	Almost.  Nothing.  You can do nothing.  That's technically the least you can do.  Praying is like third or fourth from the bottom.

t1_duljmo3	1	*	>When Jesus said this he had just asked a rich man to give everything he had to the poor and then follow him.  Gosh that sounds like a cult
t1_dulxd98	1	*	What nonsense  I'll wish death on whoever I like
t1_dulja7f	1	*	Well I don't forgive god. For a lot of things. That is, if he exists. Which he doesn't.

t1_dtoh3qq	1	*	The problem is the that people who promote shit like this and get rich doing it are the least likely to die.
t1_dtoafla	1	*	Bulgarian here, I can pretty much guarantee this is exactly how it's gonna work. 
t1_dtoai22	0	*	Thank you for the context, I was hoping that the EU wasn't subject to the kind of regulatory capture that we here in the United States of corporation have had forced on us.
t1_dv5cl5q	1	*	You could say the same exact thing snit Hamas. Read over your statement twice even. You have to discuss the whole picture and not just be ihateisrael. 
t1_dv47k83	1	*	> Buddy you can kill an infant with your thumb.   Lol, look at this badass killing babies with their thumb.
t1_dv4cp6p	1	*	There are different types of grenades. If you use just the word *grenade,* people will assume you are talking about a fragmentation grenade.

t1_dv4lf2p	1	*	What?  I thought everyone in the Middle Easy liked things with spice?
t1_dstwt2a	0	*	We should eat them.
t1_dsubtvu	1	*	It would be difficult to train sculptors who are versed in a particular type. 
t1_dsv2od3	1	*	> why doesn't it happen regularly?  Who says it doesn't?  I mean, the slavery part, not the ordering people to assassinate US Presidents part.
t1_dsv728r	1	*	It is legal, yeah. I don't know what he's on about.
t1_dsuee4s	1	*	In agriculture, margins are typically too small to pay competitively for unskilled labor. 
t1_dur76c0	0	*	Yeah man, that's what I mean. I've seen people watch classic movies on their smartphones...it's sad. 
t1_dufvsdr	0	*	What about Roy Halladay? and the numerous others I'm sure I would learn about if I actually researched the subject. I am also not interested in what you wonder about, at all.  
t1_dugoqio	1	*	Yet, controversial. 
t1_dufsjte	0	*	Ill tell you what Im blathering about, Ive got information, man. New shit has come to light! And, shit, man... she kidnapped herself. 
t1_duijpj4	1	*	Not as a result of commercial airline mishaps. Maybe private planes . 
t1_dufnq2a	0	*	66 passengers, six crew. It would have been likely that there were 2 pilots, 2 security, and two hostesses/servers on the plane.
t1_dug6hpp	1	*	Just because they can safely pilot an aircraft doesn't mean it's going to stop these senseless mass murders. 
t1_dufvk61	0	*	They don't meet safety standards. 
t1_dufr61b	1	*	No way I'm taking Air Koryo, though.
t1_dufo9f8	1	*	You know planes mostly run on auto-pilot right?
t1_dufy5ur	1	*	I've read that sometimes people don't get out of the wreckage and wait for help to arrive, even with a growing fire nearby. Something about denial or shock.
t1_dug8vol	1	*	Did this, now I'm just afraid of cars
t1_dufrear	1	*	Ban gravity. It kills lots of shit in space.
t1_dufvawv	0	*	The deadliest crash in airline history was a plane maintained/repaired by Boeing techs themselves. Though they didn't do the job correctly. 
t1_duftlzn	1	*	People die from plane crashes hitting buildings it roads too..
t1_dufpfab	1	*	I've done the 2nd longest flight you can do (16.5 hours New Zealand > Dubai) and it was honestly a breeze and I'm sometimes a bit of a nervous flier.   You'll be absolutely fine. I promise.
t1_dufo43z	0	*	I am curious to see what the maintinence record on this plane is.

t1_dufp38r	1	*	According to another article, Iran's commercial air fleet is outmoded thanks to heavy international sanctions.
t1_dufp4nk	1	*	I'm guessing more than just hearts break in a plane crash...  
t1_dug5lv9	1	*	Airplane parts are not part of the sanctions.  But trying to patch up 20+ year old aircraft is a losing proposition.
t1_dufrwjx	1	*	I take about 100+ flights a year for my job. You will be fine. Literally the safest way to travel. More than likely to die on the drive to the airport than on any flight.
t1_dug6jrr	1	*	I think dead-heading crew are counted among passengers, at least in official casualty reports.  
t1_dufsgcy	1	*	Good thing you said fuck because it wouldn't have sounded genuine otherwise 
t1_dufx8si	1	*	[International safety standards](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN13Z0G1) 
t1_dug5agi	1	*	This is something I don't really understand.  There's so many people that don't every day.  Why typemy heartfelt.. for these people?  What about the wars, famine, accidental death, etc?
t1_dug94kc	1	*	Plane-breaking, too. 
t1_dufmxve	1	*	One is the lucky ones!
t1_dufpc0y	1	*	Someone still has to write the software. Someone still has to design the plane. Someone still has to perform maintenance. In the end all aircraft accidents are human error.
t1_dufuieu	1	*	That's a false premise.  Aircraft navigation is not as sophisticated as you think.  It's only possible when a massive list of specific conditions is met. 
t1_dufzq0l	1	*	Finally! Thank you for not regurgitating out the same stupid 'statistic' about planes being safer than cars. People on Reddit seem to love spewing that out. I'm not buying it.
t1_du5v83n	0	*	People love free trade and free market capitalism so long as all their competitors play by their rules.  As soon as someone starts playing better than you, theyre cheating.
t1_du6bzdq	1	*	Could be, I just remember the Marines got involved. 
t1_du581dw	1	*	There's always the simple phone call to talk to friends (Skype does international). =) I deleted my FB acct a long time ago.

t1_du676j2	1	*	Wow, that's very George Orwell! Because she is in the UK, which is part of the EU still, she can do something about this. Have a look at my other reply on this thread for the EU link. 
t1_du5acue	1	*	Uh, m8... things are a bit better here, but the education system is fucked up and politics feel bad.
t1_du59el6	1	*	How Americans like to pretend the U.S. used to be. 
t1_du5rrqa	1	*	Count me in. Why me?
t1_du5rfzu	0	*	This should be our biggest fear. This is exactly why privacy needs to remain. You never know who gets to be in power.  (also I do have anxiety and it is exacerbated if I feel watched, gg)

t1_du7a392	1	*	Can't right now as we are in the middle of things with CNIL. But I will gladly share once this is over. Everybody has the right to know what is being captured and shared about themselves. 
t1_du4ygpc	0	*	Bad username! 
t1_du5wp4y	0	*	But WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption. It's literally impossible for them to read your texts. It might be your keyboard doing the fishy work.
t1_du5j98p	1	*	Where do you get those Ads?  I will try to disable adblocker for Facebook and see if i get something similar, since Facebook lite on my phone doesnt show that type of stuff.

t1_du5xfin	1	*	Than instead of wasting another paragraph of anyones time inform means anyone who may see things the way I do. 
t1_du6rb8k	1	*	Yep, it's pants to be in the UK, but it's heartening to see the right thing happening *somewhere*.

t1_du5kf1c	0	*	What's thir to hide from corporations?
t1_du5ir1q	1	*	Wow, being too long and convoluted for a normal consumer to read was an actual reason? It sounds like there's a fair amount of reasonable people actually running their government.

t1_du5w0y2	1	*	It is for a country that wants to have friends with lots of money.
t1_du57pyi	1	*	I dont use Facebook. That doesnt stop Facebook from putting trackers on nearly every other website I visit, or gathering data from my friends and family and compiling it in a shadow profile.
t1_du57p9n	1	*	Facebook create a virtual profile for you regardless of whether you are using it.
t1_du565x4	1	*	No FB is losing the young market. The parents went to it and all the 14-24 crowd ran away.
t1_du596zx	1	*	Shadow profiles though.

t1_dt0gn0c	1	*	How many times have you posted the same comment in this thread?
t1_dt1n6u7	1	*	Banda Aceh is not moderate at all. The rest of Indonesia is fairly moderate, but Aceh is the one (I believe only one) area that rules via Sharia law
t1_dt1gbd9	1	*	It's not the hardliners doing this. This is normal for most Muslim countries 
t1_dt139gg	1	*	He chose that punishment. He had the option to be punished under national law.  Which makes sense. I'd sooner take a few lashings then languish in an Indonesian prison, too.
t1_dt0ob9q	1	*	You state a fair point. 
t1_dt1927x	0	*	Never visit? Have you seen the foreign cess pit that is Kuta lol?
t1_dt0tpv2	1	*	Are you kidding me?  You think that prisons in Indonesia are better than prisons in the US?
t1_dt1efei	1	*	How is indonesia a shithole country? Its literally a bunch of islands with perfect weather all year & great infrastructure. 
t1_ds9cmm6	1	*	Why did he plead guilty to fake news propaganda? People are dillusional if you think taking a federal plea agreement is just something you do to avoid the hassles of court.
t1_dsb1tc2	1	*	I noticed you didn't respond! Congratulations for at least having enough self-awareness to recognize how silly you are!
t1_ds9d6g7	1	*	He has funneled money into illegal Israeli settlements. Someone who is assigned to negotiating peace between two parties shouldnt be actively undermining that process.

t1_dtbn8rj	0	*	Even if it's a real quote, which I doubt, it's not illegal to get investment from Russians. This is smoke and smear job. But very effective to an immature politicized mind.

t1_dtbndgh	1	*	It's a non sequitur. So not at all like 1 + 1 = 2 and not factually correct
t1_dtd8ngt	0	*	There is no Russia collusion.   Clinton was a candidate so bad, Trump won.   Maybe if she didn't threaten world War III prior to the election she would have won.

t1_dtcavx7	1	*	Read my previous comments. Yes.

t1_dtbkmyq	1	*	Does Jerome Corsi ever mention this? https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal   Doubt any deep state forced him to build those towers. haha
t1_dtbpr91	1	*	Apparently. 
t1_dtbjqxb	1	*	Because this article (and frankly most at this point) are making nothing but speculative statements instead of fact based arguments is apparently too difficult for you to comprehend.
t1_dtbm1bj	0	*	Trump never planned on going into a non criminal career. His plans got really fucked up by winning the election instead of losing to Hillary.
t1_dtbrh2m	1	*	yes, I loved this episode.
t1_dtbmpaw	1	*	The fact that he was selling real estate to Russians way past the value of their market price. This isnt hidden knowledge.

t1_dsnd51k	1	*	In the US probably by in Switzerland, why wouldnt it be legal.
t1_dsny6pj	1	*	and by democratically elected you mean nobodys vote actually matters because rigging/corruption, oh and that electoral college thing
t1_dsolcz4	1	*	> even more capitalist than the USA  I highly doubt that. There's A LOT more welfare and governmental regulation in Switzerland than in the US.
t1_dsnvls0	1	*	Historically that is how you end fascism 
t1_dsomk0y	1	*	An extremely high salary that you can enjoy in other countries like Thailand.

t1_dso94k0	0	*	Because Nazi is just short of Nationalist-socialist  Whilst they are by actions and goals Nazi-lite 
t1_dsolq19	0	*	Source? I'm pretty sure we do.  Not bedinungsloses Grundeinkommen, but there is a legal minimum that an employee can be paid to work.
t1_dsnp4jz	1	*	democratically elected... The rest if the world is fully aware that usa democracy is a scam and not really democracy   It's like choosing for fascism or fascism light.  Zero sugar, 200% of fuck you 
t1_dsnwa6n	1	*	No,but thanks     -Any reasonable deity.
t1_dso0iiu	1	*	I'm french but the sign shows a red button wich implies nuke (there's even the nuke symbol on it), so they are actually implying that we should nuke Trump (or the US ?), it's even worse
t1_dsnieps	1	*	who knows, maybe the sign was directed to god.

t1_dtxo7l9	1	*	What part of it is untrue? 
t1_dsyzyk9	1	*	PYD are not communists or whatever you imagine by saying that. 
t1_dsahaxo	0	*	You mean besides putting Germans into prison without a trial?   Erdogan even promised that Denis Yxfczel will not be freed as long as hes president. (Funny how he has that power in a democracy)
t1_dsmfsk6	0	*	We are not going to allow establishment of another nationalist state that will further advance current conflicts. So, it ok to kill non-state armed groups. Including PKK, PYD and its other acronyms.

t1_dus2wrw	1	*	Its a scientific marvel! U0001f92f

t1_du0yc23	0	*	You had me at (to quote Mudhoney) dude. Hell yeah. Does that mean you're as old as me? lol
t1_du2m536	1	*	I could never hate an entire people based on their geographic location. That would be just... silly.
t1_du2183s	1	*	Way to write off an entire nation of people.  Nevermind Trump didn't even win the popular vote and was elected because of a technicality...
t1_du21363	1	*	Christian in name only seems applicable here, checkmate republicans.
t1_du2fyaj	1	*	Im supposing Pence stuck with his conscience. Could you think of a better way to place spies than under the guise of coming together under the umbrella of the Olympics?
t1_du24c30	1	*	Easy? He spent his entire life training to deliver the perfect comment at the perfect time. 
t1_du0zud0	0	*	You seem like a lovely person.
t1_du18j0z	1	*	beep boop
t1_du1358u	0	*	That's like comparing wet, sloppy dog shit to white, crusty dog shit.
t1_du16d2t	1	*	People say that on here but then they cheer when two guys dress up as Kim and Trump, and get kicked out, in order to politicize the event.
t1_du0whu6	0	*	Well north koreans torture and execute christians so theres that
t1_du1de26	0	*	You are lying or misunderstood. We are not responsible for millions of deaths. 
t1_du0zv6f	0	*	What a sad, scared little life you must lead.  Divide and conquer; it's the oldest trick in the book.    
t1_du1z7s1	1	*	The Olympics have always been political, always.
t1_du21j60	1	*	Nicky Haley - Some of us would like to watch Olympics without politics  You think she will do it?
t1_du0wkn2	1	*	Yeah, the deathcamps,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6utb4IOeZhU  public executions for making contact with the outside world.  North Korea is best korea though
t1_du0w58w	1	*	That writer ain't. Show a second source.
t1_du27nmu	1	*	No he doesn't. In USA you may be coesed into it but not in other democratic countries.
t1_du1esz1	1	*	Funnily enough those firms do more for there employees that the federal government ever did.
t1_du19h8u	1	*	Interesting. My father-in-law does that to his wife. Always that it was really weird, as I had never known anyone in my life to do that until I met him. 
t1_du242be	1	*	Bans Russians around the same time a bunch of political sanctions were placed on Russians...
t1_du1awry	0	*	No man is straight enough to not find Tongaman gorgeous.
t1_du137li	0	*	Did you mean to type bottom of the barrel?
t1_du2u0do	1	*	I wasnt aware of that.   That does change my opinion. 
t1_du1omh1	1	*	The olympic charter is explicitly anti-discrimination. In an ideal world that might be an apolitical stance, but in a world with pro-discrimination leaders like Putin and Pence it isnt.
t1_dux2iuj	1	*	It happens in every war...
t1_dux6k5g	0	*	But that's, like, everywhere...
t1_dsq0l5h	1	*	Yup.  Probably contracted to a buddy of an official, used cheap knockoff materials and paid off the inspector to pass it.  Happens all over the world but morrso in asia, africa, and latin america.
t1_dsptw05	1	*	Why are there people still frowning upon dark humor in late 2010s?
t1_dspuzk9	1	*	_Checks the subreddit and rereads title_
t1_dsptzmu	0	*	It's a miracle nobody died.
t1_dspz9b1	1	*	**Yep! fiat found it's floor.**
t1_dspoj2j	0	*	> This happened at a wedding hall in Israel about 12 years ago  Try about 17 years ago.
t1_dspoyxn	0	*	Holy crap how many people died? 
t1_dspo1cl	1	*	It's the weight of their debts.
t1_dspo37s	1	*	Immediately thought of the same thing. At least, by the look of the video, there weren't a whole lot of people for the walkway to land on. 
t1_dspl5fc	0	*	This is why you don't make your floors out of literal fucking cardboard.
t1_dspzlzm	1	*	Aksually cutting corners just makes more corners.
t1_dspoksn	1	*	I can't believe you turned it into a meme already 
t1_dspixy4	0	*	What did he say?
t1_dspngeo	1	*	lol yeah but it's pretty fucking funny okay? The similarity between stock market collapse and the stock market floor collapse is objectively hilarious, excuse me for enjoying a little dark humor
t1_dspkahx	1	*	i didn't had data to watch the video. Yes, you're failure mechanic is progably the reason. I remember the Hyatt Regency failure from university.  I thought with floor they meant something else.
t1_dspliux	0	*	you'd think the local stockmarket billionaires would ensure their private club would be at least built up to does not collapse standards but what do this one knows...
t1_dsqnblz	1	*	I can't imagine how hard it must be for the people who were actually there. A coworker of mine was killed in a Jakarta hotel bombing - if I had been there I would have been freaking out.
t1_dspnfz4	1	*	This is absolutely tragic, but it's always interesting in these situations to see people jostling to be the first to make the obvious joke/observation without being horrendously offensive. 
t1_dspn7h0	1	*	Reminds me of that Hyatt Regency in Kansas City collapsing floors. perhaps due to the same issues
t1_dspxoct	1	*	Why, is the photo copyrighted?
t1_dspvd18	0	*	Haha no they didn't   Edit: [I can definitely confirm there are no deaths](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/floor-at-indonesia-s-stock-exchange-collapses-more-than-70-9862074)
t1_dspoule	1	*	Thats the one. Thank you for posting up the link.  
t1_dspx28y	1	*	I'm glad they're survived.
t1_dspxfh2	1	*	I was also confused. The floor collapsed? You'd think the floor would be the lowest a stock could go.... Need to do me some learnin'
t1_dspnu7d	1	*	Aren't parking garages designed to move and sway though? Sometimes I find myself waiting in my car in a garage and I can feel every sway and vibration
t1_dsplr2h	1	*	>Another 380 were injured, including the bride who suffered serious pelvic injuries that required surgery  Guess they didn't consummate that marriage anytime soon.
t1_dspmumg	1	*	Yea.. note to everyone that that was in Kansas City, MO. Not your typical 3rd world country (well... that could be argued I suppose in certain states/cities).
t1_dspn4zu	1	*	That incident has always fascinated me 
t1_dspmrc0	0	*	The chance of anyone doing anything anywhere being connected to someone important is very high. That's just how people work. Question is if they're playing by the rules or not 
t1_dspm2hb	0	*	Yikes. Hearing of it is one thing, seeing it is a whole another case. Was that just one floor in height? It looked a lot deeper.
t1_dsq2apb	1	*	It really means people affected by an event. Injuries can later become deaths depending on the severity, or not at all. As such Casualty is the best term.
t1_dspqxpp	1	*	I thought of that straight away too
t1_dspyz0j	1	*	Seriously that video is terrifying. You see 3 guys walk under it right before it collapses on them
t1_dtdicgv	0	*	Duh. You tarded, mate?
t1_dsnpjvl	1	*	Really, prove me wrong.
t1_dv4r5dn	1	*	Thats not correct 
t1_dv5ht8i	1	*	thanks for click bait
t1_duhkdz1	1	*	No, they stopped her care because she was blacklisted by 18 different care agencies for being abusive. Another solution should have been found, but this is not as you describe.
t1_du66062	1	*	Thanks
t1_dv2j3aa	1	*	Every time I see a cheap happy meal toy I cringe for the exact opposite reason. Useless toy, er trash, that will inevitably become a pollutant. 
t1_dv2j57z	1	*	Manure is rich in Natrium, which is quite bad for groundwater.  It shouldn't be used too much.
t1_dv2nj2i	1	*	Oh my god who gives a shit

t1_dv3us0u	1	*	Non biodegradable petroleum plastics are carbon negative. It's a shitty metric 
t1_dv2ehbl	1	*	It's one that's going to be looked at in the near future. We're not gonna stop at oil. Every human activity is gonna go under the microscope. 
t1_dv2mvoi	1	*	Near Cornwall, England, and it also just happened to be pirate and underwater Lego. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28367198 
t1_dv3upsm	1	*	They just take carbon and hydrogen from plants and make whatever toxic chemicals they want. This plastic is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum plastic.
t1_dv2jnru	1	*	*Actually*, to be really pedantic, it's 'LEGO bricks', not just 'LEGO' (in the context of the person you were replying to)
t1_dv2izrn	1	*	>> ~~Organic~~ Lego~~s~~? Sounds expensive as fuck > >FTFY > >  FTFY
t1_dv2l2hy	0	*	Might be a quality thing. Lego has *very*high standards for plastic quality, especially compared to the other brick toy companies.
t1_dv2jdqi	1	*	Actually LeGo would be more correct, since it is an abbreviation of Leg Godt (play well in Danish). Except that of course LEGO it is now a brand name. 
t1_dtkk470	1	*	You've never had laced weed?

t1_dt9f3dc	1	*	we should just table this discussion about giving the table, in order to remove the table from the floor.  you sir, now have the floor.
t1_dt8w4yh	0	*	Are you joking? People prefer freedom and economic opportunity. Israel has both of those things.
t1_dt9ki8f	0	*	They didn't have a nation.
t1_dt8v7wr	1	*	That doesn't change the fact that among the parties negotiating, it's only on their table.
t1_dt96sd1	0	*	Doesn't matter what other countries say. In reality Israel controls Jerusalem, and they're not gonna give up any portion of the city.
t1_dt9sau3	1	*	Sure there is. Zionists created it by murdering and terrorising the local arabs and thereby cohering their identity. That's roughly how all nations are forged, by outside threat.
t1_dt8n3fz	0	*	and this is exactly why there isn't a peace process on the palestinian side. 
t1_dt9kd0p	1	*	What does this have to do with conducting democratic elections? Abbas has no mandate.
t1_dt8kzlo	1	*	That's a middle eastern standard.
t1_dt8kneq	0	*	Nobody called it a theocracy, where are you getting that from?
t1_dt9vkf9	0	*	All sides have dirty hands so pick a side.  You can't shovel money to both sides and expect results.
t1_dt37mmr	1	*	Since he is Russian, was he really sober or just Russian sober?
t1_dt3lu27	1	*	Deutsche Bank declines to release details of suspicious activity in Estonian dog's account
t1_dt3fc4m	1	*	Are you joking or serious? Please don't tell me you do that or someone you know does that.
t1_dt3dp6j	0	*	Then a dog somehow hit the trigger of the gun while it was leaning against his knee without knocking it to the ground. 
t1_dsqeqdz	0	*	Dont link it to one airline. Its protocol when flying from a listed country to certain places. Its happened to me on 4+ different airlines, flying to 6 different countries. 
t1_dsqoyrn	0	*	Yes.  They get into everything and every where.  Killing them with fire seems logical after dealing with them even for a short time. 
t1_dsro5gw	1	*	some countries in the summer?
t1_dsqmelp	1	*	Sometimes British airways can be really fucking fantastic, but other times? Not so much.. I guess like all airlines I suppose
t1_due0j87	0	*	And the lack of chlorinated chicken, portions not designed to feed a whale, no American cheese, and no vomit-flavoured chocolate would really cause him a lot of suffering...?  
t1_dueq9lh	1	*	Palace guards are different than the police roaming around it. Police roam through Washington DC as well.
t1_dueubfv	1	*	Maybe if trump wasnt such a pussy we could find out. But alas.
t1_dudmh9z	1	*	I don't think you even need to go there. If he attacked police like this anywhere in America, he would have been shot. 
t1_dudrzm3	1	*	Wanna punish the man, not kill him.
t1_dufrhkb	0	*	any police officer who doesn't carry a gun is also goofy !! there penis shaped hats are still silly looking 
t1_dupn29x	0	*	Says the people who are ethnically cleansing the West Bank and holding millions of people under apartheid rule.
t1_dse9zrl	0	*	Actually I did. You don't grasp the whole story, do you?
t1_dv3fjqb	1	*	This is the only plausible way it could have happened, but the lack of details or corroboration make it sound more like an urban legend that got picked up by a tabloid.
t1_dv322an	1	*	Wtf
t1_dv3lnus	1	*	Sementics...
t1_dtxwn2j	1	*	lolol
t1_dusf82o	1	*	Once people no longer have jobs to fill the time watch the population shoot up.

t1_duwf6qh	0	*	well if your source is google, I think I'll pick baidu.
t1_duwt08f	1	*	I've had the same thing happen to me, in another part of Asia.  There truly is an East Asian mental illness, that prioritizes form over content.

t1_duwf7hn	1	*	She used to work with a Chinese human rights lawyer, who told her nothing they do matters. The rest is just irrelevant fluff I guess.
t1_duwjbhj	1	*	One of the things people ask for is a photo before you get an interview.  I'm told this is so they can reject black people.
t1_dum2nq0	1	*	I mean... Some might.
t1_dumkk9w	1	*	Americans don't need iPhones, we need homes and cars and retirement.
t1_dumbd73	1	*	Right, but what happens to the profit margin? Who is really taking home the bulk of the benefit?

t1_dt8lnub	0	*	It just takes enough dissatisfaction and someone willing to take a risk to offer an alternative
t1_dt28kxh	0	*	I disagree: we're citizens, not members of the fourth estate. Journalist, publication, etc. should mean something - or else why are we giving them the time of day?
t1_dt29nv2	0	*	The main indicator for how people voted on brexit wasn't age, it was education.   Yes, lots of old people voted leave, but so did lots of younger people too, who lacked critical thinking skills.

t1_dsaixty	0	*	Arguments that start with 'so you...' and then shoehorn the argument in the weakest form possible can easily be ignored.
t1_ds9wxby	1	*	Hopefully a reality one day. People should own up to what they claim to believe. 
t1_dsamxxa	1	*	IIRC the quote was people denying Israel's right to exist. So if you say Israel should be wiped off the map that would fall under the scope of these proposed measures.

t1_dsbzqx6	0	*	Perhaps. But how to identify? Ask them a question or see their social media posts? 
t1_dsa84gn	1	*	Well, then they can continue that line of thinking somewhere else. Most people don't like their fanatic behaviour.
t1_dsa21mw	1	*	Why would you be laughing at a genocide?
t1_dsbnilv	0	*	Wasn't there an issue with it in Mississauga like six months ago?
t1_dsaav0t	1	*	Phobia means aversion. Oil is hydrophobic, it isn't afraid of water it just has an aversion to it.
t1_du2r5sy	1	*	AKA, Pope-poo.  >Hey guys, look at him with all his superfluous letters...
t1_dugxapm	1	*	Or just the card really.

t1_ds33bz2	1	*	You decide!
t1_ds3k3qi	1	*	The relevant ones that make people money do rely on mining though.
t1_ds2zy50	0	*	At least it doesn't cost 250kWH to spend a fucking dollar. Bitcoin is the dumbest thing I've seen in my life, besides Trump being elected president. Even criminals are getting away from Bitcoin now. 
t1_ds3240l	1	*	arent they trying to fork something to make mining on asics difficult / impossible? ... or was that the whole bitcoincash thing ? 
t1_ds30ahv	1	*	At least those are useful leasure activities and not idiots trying to create value out of something with negative value. 
t1_ds37i6y	0	*	i said bitcoin, but i mean all cryptocurrency.   don't pretend like bitcoin isn't still synonymous with all major concurrency. 
t1_ds5v1lg	0	*	Yeah. Making it illegal won't do much. Caste System is a part of the Hindu religion. It's never going away. 
t1_dtu9ysy	1	*	Yeah, guys, *sometimes* unions chip in for striking workers, usually, though, you're not getting paid. Striking means negotiations have failed and is not a desired outcome.

t1_dsm0trq	1	*	Gotta justify that huge military industrial complex
t1_dsn23mx	0	*	sigh... what did he steal?
t1_dunweyp	1	*	In my neck of the woods, a lot of people throw a bitch fit at McDonald's if they're served their sweet tea in a plastic cup and not a styrofoam one. So it's definitely still prevalent in some areas.
t1_dunxh9g	0	*	Hopefully this will make CFA change.  I cant stand styrofoam cups. 
t1_dunyc90	1	*	Fuck kebab man, that's dirty food afaic
t1_dunxzze	1	*	My local McDs used styrofoam cups until a few months ago for their large drinks. They've since switched to paper so this is probably already an ongoing thing
t1_dunsngz	1	*	Hmmm.....hmmmmmmmmmm...ya fair enough.
t1_dunur4a	0	*	I never eat at McDonalds but I would 100% go for an affordable veg burger 
t1_dunvlj6	1	*	Im in the UK and the hospital that I work uses it.  Thats what happens when you outsource catering I guess.
t1_dunuh86	1	*	Up until about 2 months ago, all the ones buy me used foam for large drinks
t1_dunxe4p	1	*	Breakfast platters and the large tea cups.
t1_duntx1t	1	*	McDonald's in the Midwest havr Styrofoam cups for their large iced teas.  I've never been to a McDonald's that didn't have Styrofoam cups oddly enough, but maybe its only in the Midwest.
t1_dunts9v	0	*	Because Chick-Fil-A is a shit company with a shit CEO 
t1_dunvf3b	1	*	They've cut it mostly out but some stuff uses it. I think pancakes.

t1_dunx7js	1	*	Order hotcakes. 
t1_dunogl2	0	*	Darn those ketchup packets!
t1_dunr8nq	1	*	Now there's a reference I haven't heard in a long time.
t1_dunx766	1	*	Does it depend on the temperature of the location? Insulation for your to go burger. 
t1_dunuobb	1	*	I love Taco Time
t1_duo9yix	0	*	Oh it was when they manufactured the container? I always thought the cfc's were released when the foam broke down (either naturally or incinerated). Til, thanks! 
t1_dunue68	1	*	The McDonald's here use foam cups but I think that's it. I hope they keep them. 
t1_dtnwq9a	1	*	Which is why it sucks that the Saudis are Western allies and not Iran.    If the Iranians ever get rid of their theocratic regime, the Kingdom will fade in relevance.
t1_dtn4hya	0	*	The ability to choose to wear them if you want to can be empowering. Note that the key here is choice; nothing to do with headscarves themselves. 
t1_dtmz6ew	1	*	No swearing
t1_dtohhsv	1	*	its a tool of oppression and pushes thinking in 2 types of people from child state on, the included ones and the lesser ones
t1_dtnliu2	1	*	Honest question, devoted to what? Dont you think modesty come from within and not with what you wear? Do you guys ever sit down and think about this?
t1_dtmypge	1	*	Depends, what makes them *special*? ( xb0  xb0)
t1_dtn3coz	0	*	I mentioned Arab too because many narrow-minded religious Turks glorify Arab culture just because of its ties to Islam. Middle Eastern culture is more than that.
t1_dtn8mwz	1	*	Being able to wear what you want in a western world whether hijab or not is empowering, forcing someone to follow a dress code similar to Iran is not, both are different topics entirely.
t1_dtmou1y	1	*	Just wear [Scuba](https://www.scuba.com/images/multi/wet-suits/ScubaPro-7-5mm-Everflex-Steamer-Super-Stretch-Hood-Big-4.jpg) gear
t1_dtnascm	1	*	Antalya is very progressive as well as other big cities like Istanbul or Izmir. But we have lots of problems as well.
t1_dtoc91q	1	*	Haven't you heard!? Pussy hats are banned! They finally figured out it was ridiculous. Oh, wait, they didn't. It was apparently transphobic :D
t1_dto4zzv	1	*	Thats insane damn
t1_dtn6kfc	1	*	I think it is quite the opposite.
t1_dtmw3ef	0	*	Do you support woman walking around naked? You might, but most people do not. Its just our culture...
t1_dtocc25	0	*	I find it amazing that you comment has negative points. There's not a single thing in there that is not true, even to a feminist. Are they downvoting it because it's expressed in a clear way?
t1_dtn76rm	1	*	Yea, but if you want to compare it to women being forced to cover their bodies, the men should have to wear blindfolds.
t1_dtmxpms	1	*	More like 15 years. 
t1_dtmqbkv	1	*	I agree
t1_dtmw3ht	1	*	Yes lets pretend that its voluntary. 
t1_dtn0hw6	1	*	It's called religion, they live by the book.
t1_dtnohuk	1	*	It's a point of perspective. 
t1_dtn35zc	1	*	Ya, it's in Iran.

t1_dv604fx	0	*	Where are all the SJW's ? only 5 comm.... don't play dumb
t1_dtup67w	1	*	In France driving instructors can't use their phone either but I know a few who did pretty often.
t1_dttgdgc	1	*	That makes sense. The instructor is technically the only person in the car with the driving experience and presence of mind.
t1_dtmwnu0	0	*	I do. Its got 4 wheels and has collateral damage.

t1_ds8vqfg	0	*	If your a service based company you don't want to offend your customer base, just saying I was happy with the religious garb ban. You don't want to hear my beliefs well the feeling is mutual.
t1_dsa5g8n	0	*	what kind of alcoholism is drinking no alcohol? 
t1_du19rqm	0	*	They will be better of becoming SAA's bitch.  Winning some sort of autonomy from Syria will be easier than getting slaughtered by Turkey 
t1_du1eraw	0	*	President Gollum is the terrorist.
t1_du1vpw8	1	*	I dont know why your being downvoted, you are right. The Turks have a long history of this kind of thing. 
t1_du1g6pk	1	*	>It is Turkey protecting its borders and defending itself against terrorism  This is happening outside of the Turkish border.
t1_du31rr4	0	*	Enjoy your dictatorship
t1_du1g1az	1	*	Considering Erdogan's broad support base in Turkey, you might have a point.
t1_dv0zobk	1	*	did u ever beat it? im not sure we ever did. maybe like once and then had zero lives left and died immediately after.
t1_dua87xf	1	*	Unfortunately I can't agree with him or anyone in the ANC being 'good'. Even the best people in the party are complicit in some way with the Zuma situation.  We can but hope that they learn to change.

t1_dsv6lqr	1	*	Let's slow down there champ, you're making far too much sense.
t1_dsv874x	0	*	If you really think Obama and Trump are shoveling the same shit, you are either willfully ignorant or completely retarded.   Probably the latter. 
t1_dsv74ok	1	*	Well hes backed out of trade deals with Canada, and also threatened to defund NATO so hes tapped into all of their pockets. But IMO its his attitude that pisses everyone off the most. 
t1_dtqyfv5	0	*	Tax evasion is super nationalistic. 
t1_dtrlvj3	0	*	The Bulgars were equestrian nomads that didn't really show up until around 480 AD.   There is no way they had anything to do with Ancient Macedonians.  
t1_dtqfry4	1	*	I know. 
t1_dttix1n	1	*	Yeah right. So my grandfather brainwashed me into being Macedonian and not quite understanding what the Bulgarians are saying makes me an illiterate or deaf?

t1_dsoazgg	1	*	He's wrong about this one
t1_dsoc20e	0	*	I've dated and had business partnerships with Americans and no one has experienced anything like that in England, sounds like an urban myth to me. No one thinks that way in England.
t1_dso9wx3	1	*	<3 
t1_dsorapy	0	*	It's kind of sad to say but I've had very little exposure to New Zealand. For all intents and purposes New Zealand is an extension of Australia in my mind.
t1_dsodoly	1	*	As a Britisher I find that a bit strong. And a 'malevolent obsession' is stretching things way too far. Maybe there's some types like that, but its never felt like a popular impression.
t1_dso6ovz	0	*	Tatcher was a living god, Corbyn is a god damn soviet asset.

t1_duoi20u	1	*	[waves hey from north of Houston]  Absolutely.  
t1_dunv1ay	1	*	So gun laws wont stop all shootings.  Not all antibiotics cure all diseases or work every time so why bother having them either?
t1_dunwaye	0	*	I say it's the general dismissive attitude most feel towards people with mental illnesses in this country, probably because we're far too obsessed with our own lives to truly care.
t1_dunua68	1	*	Ve are all Rooosians now komrade.
t1_dup9dnz	1	*	What OP was really trying to say is but you are all white. Somehow in the US racism is still mainstream.
t1_duopksf	1	*	Didnt a guy kill 22 people in a train station in china with a knife? Didnt a guy in france run over a crowd of people with a van. And those are just the ones i heard about and i live 10000 mile away. 
t1_dup3qu5	1	*	You obviously have no clue.  You dont live here so you don't see what I see.    If you did, your views would change.

t1_duopykw	1	*	Even in MA you only have to be 15.
t1_duokvug	1	*	In Alabama you can be gifted a pistol at 18. That's also the age you can get a concealed carry permit.

t1_dunoygp	1	*	lmao what
t1_duoj8a9	0	*	Police have problems dealing with crowded active shooter situations. What makes you think a teacher with firearms training can handle a situation that's difficult for a SWAT team?
t1_dunte2r	0	*	Sorry I meant Norway!! I guess it's not the same thing..
t1_dunlffy	0	*	Hold the firearm owners responsible for actions made using their weapons and you'll start to see a lot more people securing that shit. 
t1_duobj92	0	*	This guy thinks that anyone invading the US would use conventional means. WW3 will mostly be conducted by guys behind laptops aiming from satellites. You and your 9mm wont change a thing.

t1_duo0l14	1	*	Yep.
t1_dupdy49	0	*	So an organization is paying politicians to prevent making laws that the majority of the population wants??  Isn't that called corruption?

t1_duli8le	1	*	What is?
t1_dujmz1i	0	*	Pretty sure that the largest polluters for the past few decades have been China by a long shot. Most of your sterotypical White men have greatly cut down on the pollution they cause.
t1_dtiu0ea	1	*	One of Obama's biggest failures was not closing it. 
t1_dtiiots	0	*	Another problem is it is such a good deal. The US gov pays about 4 grand a month to rent the area. And half the time the Cuban government doesnt bother to cash the check.
t1_dtipavi	1	*	I mean their unlawful combatants if they've served their usefulness we can always liquidate them
t1_dtigax7	1	*	When you say republicans but you really mean the senate. But you everything you dont like must be done by your enemy I guess. The Dems voted to keep it open in 2009 just in case you were unaware.

t1_dtikaow	1	*	I'd say the fact that anyone working directly or indirectly for the US government, regardless of where in the world that is, gets to ignore US laws, is very fucked up.
t1_dtifqz3	0	*	If information can be verified by other means why would you resort to torturing people, an act that puts you at the same level as war criminals and terrorists.

t1_dtigls8	1	*	It's pretty clear sarcasm

t1_dtilc8l	1	*	> no longer torture and detain them without charge without breaking American law.  You mean Chicago ? 
t1_dtilvyo	1	*	Most would get released at trial.   The torture has made it impossible to actually punish them. So those who are terrorists will go free because of Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld and Co. 
t1_dtiiydo	1	*	lol he could've closed it with a single executive order. 
t1_dtj7gd2	1	*	Don't look at me. Obama tried to close GITMO and, when he couldn't, ended up releasing most of the people detained there. Clinton said in 2016 that she supports the closure of GITMO.
t1_dtijac8	1	*	Won't somebody *please* think of the families that live off of torturing people who are held without trial?
t1_dtiu5hb	1	*	Most governments probably do this, its a matter of how public it is.

t1_dtjkb8d	1	*	Most are terrorist anyway? Its not like they torture them for fun. They do it for intel. 
t1_dtiha6g	1	*	The reason Trump says these weird ass things is because the day before or an hour before a professional explains these things to him. His weird speeches is him trying to tell us what they told him.
t1_dtifvit	0	*	Well, it is the land of the free. The land of the free only for people who look and think exactly like me! So, if you're not a white evangelical Christian, you can just die in the Gitmo.  edit: /s
t1_dtimyav	1	*	Our jails are full of people that haven't yet had their trial....
t1_dtirtc6	1	*	>no one wants the prisoners  I'm sure the families of those held without due process or trial disagree.
t1_dtisgqi	1	*	Additionally, after the shit that went on there, there's a good chance that we radicalized at least some of them. We pretty much backed ourselves into a corner with that prison in every possible way.

t1_dtioj0p	1	*	I hope the whole party ends up there, as enemies of the state. 
t1_dtt8ag4	0	*	yes
t1_dttexy6	1	*	I knew it was clickbait when I saw biohacker instead of researcher
t1_dt88a31	1	*	That is utterly stupid, laws never ever solved problems, it was an stupid decision in the first place.  
t1_dt88oqq	0	*	Welllllll,   If there's a demand, and only if there's a demand, the supply side reacts. 
t1_dt8ldkk	0	*	I dont think she has experts.  All I can really find is no man were like totally working on getting some funding, itll be great.

t1_dt7je6a	1	*	That's exactly it. they don't care because we did it to them under force of arms. 
t1_dt7mngd	1	*	I think I knew who Jeff Sessions was but I don't recall   
t1_dthtmsm	0	*	But there is an election coming up. Maybe he will get voted out... Or get 125% of the registered vote. They always forget to poll the dead people. Dead people love Putin.

t1_dtihs2z	1	*	Kill, bribe, or threaten anyone who stands in my way isn't especially deceptive. But it's worked for Russian leaders for the past hundred years. Why stop now?
t1_dthrgun	1	*	I dont think online posing matches really shake up the us as much as you think they do. 
t1_dtio2ye	1	*	Furthermore, since when was the space program based on positive relations - it was literally a war backed by the threat of nuclear destruction.
t1_dtidpw2	1	*	It's a pretty common term in international relations, I like it better than superpower.
t1_dth77iu	1	*	You're going to have to wait a lot longer than I do
t1_dtiglfq	1	*	Eventually it will be revealed that Hades was actually Putin, and it was he who stole ~~the Christmas~~ *Persephone*, the personification of the Western Freedom!
t1_dtgv2eq	0	*	Other people who corroborated his story all ended up dead...  Also, he wasn't just a random doctor, he was the guy who set up the lab. He was the head honcho.
t1_dthjemd	1	*	Ras Putin.
t1_dskt9p8	1	*	So that's the no business half.
t1_dslf8j0	1	*	Heh, good luck boycotting china it's almost impossible at this point

t1_dv2tql9	0	*	In the Netherlands life means life. So that makes this sentence sound extreme. But with this possibility of parole it may be fair. As long as he gets psychological help. 
t1_dtc2ird	0	*	africa is a shithole nobody cares
t1_ds22ixb	1	*	I didn't know the IRS's jurisdiction extended to Canada as well
t1_ds281bl	1	*	You only fudge your taxes to shave a dozen hours off your income. The hedge fund manager takes people's money and loses it via a Ponzi scheme.
t1_ds26vix	0	*	Because our generation grew up with news access via the internet as an everyday thing, we never had to buy a paper. We take for granted that it needs to be paid for because it's always been there.
t1_ds2j9c4	1	*	> New industry with inexperienced fools rushing in.   While I agree with you here, new industry always brings people just wanting to make and safe money, it doesn't have to be fools.

t1_ds244id	1	*	To be fair Oregons testing is some of the most lenient in the country next to cali. At least until a few months from now.
t1_ds27byl	0	*	For herb yeah, for vape oil I'm not so sure.  Here is an article about it: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/are-weed-vape-pens-safe-w507084
t1_ds2l4s2	1	*	Legal states maintain a list of approved products. In Oregon the ODA publishes a list. There's also the OMRI list. 
t1_ds2a81i	1	*	And what about all the crop that's been sold already using illegal pesticides? Gonna hop in the Ole time machine and destroy that too?
t1_ds2nmrx	1	*	I read somewhere that with heavy metals, ingestion does much less harm than smoking, with skin absorption being somewhere in the middle. 
t1_ds2h9ck	1	*	They will probably do it by plant or per spray. Either way.  Crops get sprayed on a weekly basis so that shit will add up fast
t1_ds2hcce	0	*	They're free to walk around their cage!
t1_ds2vy0b	1	*	>  and its a short term need  That's objectively false. A lot of people require opioid maintenance for long periods of time. Some for most of their lives.

t1_ds2m4ef	1	*	I'd counter with how can a news website (a real news website and not a clickbait extravaganza that relies on clickbait articles and clickbait ads) exist if it can't make money.
t1_ds2io73	1	*	Another reason legal cannabis is so much more beneficial than illegal.
t1_ds28kgw	0	*	Is there concern with other methods of using cannabis like vaping or extracting cannabinoids for edibles?
t1_ds23r35	1	*	Lol ok.
t1_ds23xgx	1	*	Yeah that's what I was gonna say.  Not just smoking it but also often concentrating it.
t1_ds2enkx	1	*	Well, I guess that could happen. 
t1_ds25wfb	1	*	I work on an organic farm and the only 'pesticides' we use are lady bugs.
t1_ds24tkl	1	*	Oh, good. I was afraid I was going to have to get extra picky again about only getting organic home grown. Super glad this is a thing.
t1_ds21qxu	0	*	What do you do for a living? Can I have it for free?
t1_ds26cuj	1	*	Companies like Tilray and Aurora are federally licensed producers in Canada.  Makes sense as someone had to produce the cannabis for the MMPR program.
t1_ds26msk	1	*	As someone from Oregon this is good to hear. Seen friends get sick from spraying and bombing, a lot of that shit is no joke!
t1_ds276kj	0	*	How does one become a cannabis consultant? Any certs required?
t1_ds23plg	0	*	>So yeah: no 'cost of doing business' scenario when there's no product to do business with.  Depends how many years they expect to get away with it before getting caught.
t1_ds2sxy5	1	*	Exactly, the entire point of legalising it is that it allows for sensible regulation like this.
t1_ds25j9n	0	*	russet mites can be a bitch. Try heat / co2 before cyanos or permethrin.
t1_ds29bvr	1	*	 You should read the article as it mentioned some violators and that they'd even hide the illegal pesticide in the ceiling tiles when inspectors came.  They new it was illegal and used it. 
t1_dtx704v	1	*	>The famous Mister ~~Ed~~ Dead!  
t1_dtxjvtw	1	*	He fucked your self esteem to death... and then fucked it some more

t1_dtxbjmt	1	*	I did naht!
t1_dtx9rrs	0	*	In fact I'd even say it's despicable.
t1_dtxkmw0	1	*	I doubt it was only one tbh. This one just happened to be famous. (If you're fucked up enough to violate a corpse...)
t1_dtyb4xu	1	*	A corpse is a corpse, (of course of course)  And no one would talk to a corpse (of course)  Unless of course the corpse (of course) is  The famous Mister Dead!

t1_dtq5fvq	1	*	Precisely.  Truly bizarre. There are a lot of bad things about the current polish government, but this is not one of them. 
t1_dsx03qe	0	*	But Canada has so much space. Why can't we store it where no one could possibly be around it? If only for space reasons.
t1_dsx3bm7	1	*	The only waste will be the liters of bodyfat gushing away 
t1_dsx8sim	0	*	How about not near a major river that would effect over a million people?
t1_dsxnb51	0	*	I would normally be fine with them storing that waste wherever. But not near a river.
t1_dse1v7q	0	*	Dont like it lobby to change it

t1_ds1pzrf	0	*	South America doesn't exactly like the US, and Eastern Europe doesn't like Russia, and the Mid East doesn't exactly like Europe but they all still do business.
t1_ds23n1c	0	*	America has registered more trade disputes, and has more registered against under the WTO than any other country or bloc
t1_ds2576t	1	*	And we enjoy your survalience too, and if you think we let the Chinese oversee our tech production you're fucking drunk.
t1_dt8bjfe	0	*	Im not challenging you, but I hadnt heard of kgb poisonings on us soil. Do you by chance have any links or names to look up?

t1_dsg1rz4	0	*	1948?
t1_du6lt7g	1	*	Are there no Russian laws about free and fair elections? Serious question
t1_du6a6ci	1	*	Well their motto doesn't in any way bind them to a certain type of behaviour. It's just ironic that their actions are completely the opposite.
t1_du664hc	1	*	No, its only a first amendment violation if its the government.
t1_du6uw4b	1	*	It's being demanded under the EU's Right to be Forgotten act

t1_du6828z	1	*	Their new motto would be Baboon is better than weasel, or - You don't need pants for the victory dance.
t1_du6upqj	1	*	English you mean. Since they're the one who came up with the name.
t1_dt7qkxh	0	*	See reply to the other guy with the same exact attempted insult. You all must not be a very original bunch around here.
t1_du73cax	1	*	Did you know police might indict Netanyahu for bribery?
t1_dup8kxh	1	*	Pretty sure that stunt got him a bump up in the polls in his local electorate.
t1_dupec6q	0	*	So, unlikely to be a Squadron Sergeant-Major in this context?
t1_dte6ebq	1	*	China is a developing country and it's normal for many developing countries to have protectionist policies because their companies are still catching up (e.g. Japan and SK in the 60s).

t1_ds9xhi0	1	*	We have a Carolina Dog -an American pariah breed who s sweet and strange.looks like a dingo which is what almost all pariah breeds all over the world revert to. 
t1_ds8mezw	1	*	Bless your heart. ufe0f Your baby will struggle but his life is going to be much easier because you love him so much.
t1_ds8iv5o	0	*	I had a little applehead Siamese and she was the sweetest, smartest, most social, and most beautiful little cat I've ever met. She spoiled me for all other cats.  
t1_ds956rt	1	*	Good, people shouldn't be encouraged to buy dogs that fucked up that suffer their whole life just for for their owner's entertainment.
t1_ds8wt43	0	*	Get one from a kennel club approved breeder 
t1_ds8mqb2	1	*	The AKC pet insurance will cover their problems if you pay top notch which is like $88/month. 
t1_ds8mntf	1	*	I learned about this last week on the Freakonomics podcast. 
t1_ds9acsc	1	*	They call themselves Pet Lovers, while dogs and cats die to the tune of 14 Million a year in Shelters. Fuck Breeders.
t1_ds8wals	1	*	My family used to show Great Danes. Different dog breeds have different types of owners. I honestly think they just did it as an excuse to travel and get wasted with other Dane owners. 
t1_ds8xv1r	1	*	Strangely? Its not strange that super inbred dogs have problems. 
t1_ds8e5uy	0	*	We're talking about the video of him walking around the ring, though.
t1_ds8gmap	1	*	I hate how the new oriental ones look, that face can't be right. 
t1_dsaj3x4	0	*	Thats like saying all pet quality dogs dont have the same potential issues as show quality dogs...
t1_ds8h8nx	1	*	Subtle abuse?   
t1_ds9go38	1	*	I bought my Boston Terrier. Anyone who doesn't like it can get fucked. Might buy another one soon.
t1_ds8kytf	1	*	Some landraces are, like the Africanis or Canaan dog. Indian pariahs probably will be eventually. 
t1_ds8l9te	1	*	 She's really adorable and it looks like she has a good sized snoot!
t1_ds8vo5o	1	*	If it makes you feel any better, my neighbor is a Great Dane rescue guy. He must loose three dogs a year. The guy is a saint. Lot better human than me.
t1_ds8ts5a	1	*	I prefer to watch/support agility course events now. They're much more accepting about whatever came down the alley and they tend to focus on everyone (doggos included) just having a good time. 
t1_ds8fy5s	0	*	Why would someone take their BMW to the vet? 
t1_ds8imvz	1	*	Yep, then we teamed up and decided to work together.  Thousands and thousands of years ago.
t1_ds8tldc	1	*	Then you're not rescuing a dog, you're being robbed.
t1_ds8l3kl	0	*	Yeah, you have to change it a little. Like obesity is 95% genetics and is a marker for all sorts of diseases so doctors are urging obese humans to get fixed.
t1_ds8gytq	1	*	It's called heterosis or hybrid vigor
t1_dsa45k6	1	*	It's routine. A few surgeries, a lot of appointments and prescriptions. Lost a wonderful little guy to cancer last year, paid for that. It adds up very fast.
t1_ds938xo	1	*	I've seen far too many damaged dog with behavioral problems. Training puppies is the only safe way to raise dogs alongside children.
t1_ds8jatk	1	*	Agreed. Pugs, poms, and shit zhus too
t1_ds8dk1l	0	*	just be sure to neuter them if you adopt one
t1_ds9hpyn	1	*	As a 3 dog 5 cat household with everyone a rescue mixed breed...I agree
t1_ds8lf0u	0	*	People throw that word around so much it has no meaning anymore when it comes to pets. Unless you find an animal in immediate danger and save it, you didn't *really* rescue it. 
t1_ds8g6ru	0	*	What an ethical dilemma. 
t1_ds8h639	0	*	Same.   https://i.imgur.com/8gcmJ2Q.jpg 
t1_ds8he9i	0	*	Look at the terrier group as a whole. The healthiest group. Only breed with major issues is westies and that's because of their over popularity.
t1_ds93x4u	1	*	Youre a good owner :). Sad we dont have more who want fit bulldogs
t1_ds8o56k	1	*	who even shows dogs anyways? of the hundreds of dog owners ive known, not a single one has ever shown interest in dog shows. 
t1_ds8ijpn	1	*	This is more common. I wouldnt trust a breeder selling 1.5k frenchies 
t1_ds97drs	1	*	I just simply don't understand it.  The best dogs are the ones that love you and the temperature variation of their balls doesn't matter.
t1_ds8n5o7	1	*	There are hundreds of breeds the AKC doesnt recognize. There are more non-AKC dog breeds than there are AKC breeds.
t1_ds8v81r	0	*	Nature would have phased them out in the absence of human intervention...they are a product of selective breeding to begin with, you nincompoop.
t1_ds8qvd5	0	*	Yeah I petsit for my friends who have two pugs and they are the best. I like how lazy they are cause Im lazy too. No way I could handle a husky or other high-energy breeds. 
t1_ds8nu0p	1	*	My parents' beagle had that issue. Plugging her nose consistently helped.
t1_ds8ltl1	0	*	Are mixes known to be healthier? I have a half boxer and then shepherd/pit mix who just turned one. Not sure what to expect - should I buy insurance? 
t1_ds8j6lo	1	*	Cause leaving it there to rot is so righteous, and what a shame she has a pet she can love now 
t1_ds987h1	1	*	Thank you so much... its good to know that the people taking care of Chester cares like you do. Thank you for the work you do
t1_ds8frlo	0	*	Rattlesnake bites are directly related to the breed of dog. Snakes gotta have standards ya know.

t1_ds8ga7b	1	*	GO GET BUSY BEE!
t1_ds8hkj1	1	*	That wouldn't be the akc, it would be the german shepherd club of america. The akc actually doesn't set standards.
t1_ds8ecae	1	*	Neither are these, which make me sad. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lacy
t1_ds8la66	1	*	You sure you don't mean cavalier king Charles spaniel? The neurological issue with ESS is usually rage syndrome. 
t1_ds8gz67	1	*	Somehas to do the effort to track breeding, write a standard, get entries, etc. It takes years. Few people are doing that with a landrace.
t1_ds8h53f	1	*	I got my German Shepherd in my state and he doesn't have a sloped back.. Not all German Shepherds have it or were bred for it. You have to find GSDs from working lines, not show lines
t1_ds8r0a5	0	*	If you vouch for him I guess hes aiight
t1_ds8cczo	1	*	~~pure bred~~   in bred   
t1_ds8d8i8	1	*	Boston owner here. Best dog Ive ever met. Agree. 
t1_ds8mwh0	1	*	That I agree with also, with so many dogs in shelters, squish-faced and otherwise, adoption should really be the go-to option when acquiring a dog.
t1_ds8ezwi	1	*	Yea they do, I bought my pug off Craigslist because the mommy pug got knocked up
t1_ds8jcjj	1	*	I think Huskies are an exception to that rule.
t1_ds8two6	0	*	Agree, never knew one that wasn't a sweetheart.
t1_dsl5t22	1	*	I know right? Its exhausting to think people actually breed those useless, stupid, ugly animals.
t1_ds8ipyx	1	*	I don't have an opinion on that.
t1_ds8guqn	1	*	Do you have any source for that? Because I've been showing since I was 10 and my dogs and I have a blast. 
t1_ds98kf3	1	*	Happy to give you a little thrill there.
t1_ds8qsur	0	*	This is the first time I've ever heard of any public outcry. No need to get so passive-aggressive
t1_ds8hujy	1	*	Santa's little helper?    I have had a lot of dogs like that. Dog personality varies a lot from dog to dog, it's just an overarching personality I see in most of them.    
t1_ds8wva6	1	*	I kind of don't know what point you are trying to make by comparing an out of context snippet of one sentence with another.
t1_ds8otn0	1	*	Good luck telling that to New Yorkers
t1_ds8mf9f	1	*	It is but sadly irresponsible breeding is lucrative because people cant understand the difference. 
t1_ds8k9oz	1	*	I bought my dog, AMA.
t1_ds8tr84	1	*	I wanna get the muttiest mutty and enter it in competition
t1_ds8k6tp	0	*	Replying to this comment because my phone wont let me see the damn link :(
t1_ds8gwzt	1	*	Yeah, it looks gross like that. People always try to push the limit instead of just enjoying a good thing.
t1_ds93hvt	1	*	That doesn't fix the fact that they have these problems. It only temporarily treats the symptoms, it doesn't FIX the root cause(bad airways.)
t1_ds8fvu9	1	*	That is precisely what OP is saying yes.
t1_ds8dmmb	1	*	Except incidents of hip dysplasia are on the rise in at least Labs and Goldens in that list and the fact that you said most forms of Terriers... Well, you shot your argument in the foot right there.
t1_ds8m1rc	1	*	Is there like a showdog competition that only competes on cuteness and good boyness?
t1_ds8o7yl	1	*	Hybrid vitality?  I think that's used to refer to an animal that's from two separate species (mules being the most obvious example), but I suppose it still fits if we aren't being pedants, doesn't it?
t1_ds8ozso	1	*	I'm in the same situation. But hoping for a little older, maybe 3 or 4 years old. I hope you find the right one!
t1_ds9k6a5	1	*	exactly. i didn't name my  German Shepard lab mix Dogmeat for no reason

t1_dstw0mi	0	*	If Russia invaded Sweden the Swedes would figure out a way to blame Israel and America. They know nothing else.
t1_dttjpzw	0	*	>  Circumcised men still enjoy sex  Heck yes we do! 
t1_dttn7ko	1	*	It's culture that ultimately causes it, but education certainly decreases it.
t1_dttna9z	1	*	Why don't you list every country on the planet without looking them up right now?  Oh that's right, you fucking can't.    
t1_dubfab6	1	*	They had a civil war that ended in 2006, after which the monarchy ended. Communist-led coalitions ended up being the ruling ones since then.
t1_dtep3r7	0	*	Where did you find the statistic that 57k emigrated last year? I call bullshit
t1_dtej8ka	1	*	> Reddit always told me  You aren't convincing anyone if what 'Reddit' said. Very few reasonable people on this website have called that country a 'workers paradise'.

t1_ds3lulr	1	*	Make Israel multicultural!
t1_ds3hlak	0	*	can you cite sources for that?
t1_ds8k7y7	0	*	Yep, they're made artificially scarce to keep the price high, yet the resell value is among the worst in the market.
t1_ds8ulkl	1	*	Its better to have your own currency since you can control it for better or worse. Greece cant deflate the euro to encourage investment and exports.
t1_ds8jpjh	1	*	Yes
t1_duass3o	0	*	OK Mr. Conspiracy.

t1_duc2hgf	1	*	Shallow and retarded, seriously?  Go learn what that  downstairs stretching involves and then rethink your comment.
t1_duc2up6	1	*	I know, tbh as I've got older I have noticed my Mum's tendency for exaggeration so I do wonder as to the veracity. It comes to something when you doubt your own creation myth.....
t1_ducyoix	1	*	It is absolutely not less risky.
t1_duc0udk	1	*	I don't know, my scar is barely visible and covered by my pubic hair. They seem to be good at making it discreet now. My mom had a c-section 18 years ago and she said hers was pretty big.
t1_ds1uv5e	0	*	Quote marks means you're quoting someone....

t1_dtlme6o	1	*	lol Canadians are just as bad. every single post so glad we don't have x problem up here in Canada
t1_duspyz6	1	*	But how do you explain Hillary's defeat? Check mate /s
t1_dustonv	0	*	Yeah but then replaced them with another autocracy.
t1_dusr2xw	0	*	This post is full of anti Russia Shills. Be prepared to be downvotes to hell. They are pushing a narrative. 
t1_dusrior	1	*	and what happens to Russian hackers when they travel in US allied states?  :]  
t1_duss2a7	0	*	Then shot them all and melted them in acid
t1_dusn2k2	1	*	Because you always experiment before you go big. They didn't go straight into the large hadron collider and fire it up crossing their fingers.
t1_dutm1th	1	*	fighting olympics by hacking them because they were banned for doping and now they are caught doping again? Russian logic.  what do you think the national image of Russia is right now?

t1_durq4qd	1	*	Getting evicted from your place of work and shredding documents from the place you just got fired from before leaving. Sounds pretty normal to me.
t1_dt0rk51	1	*	Anyone would do that. They're protecting him because they can't acknowledge that the Russia shit is more than the type of with hunts they make up.
t1_dt08iei	1	*	partisan
t1_dszljgf	1	*	Just a pro tip for future endeavors - don't use 6 hour old accounts to make pro-Trump posts. It's really, really obvious.

t1_dt170af	1	*	except the popular vote didn't determine this election.
t1_dszowo3	0	*	I love that this comment gets downvotes. I hate trump as much as the next guy and am confident he is guilty of all the things and want him thrown in jail BUT that doesnt mean down voting this post. 
t1_dt0a8du	1	*	Farce is probably among the best terms to describe the Trump presidency, yeah.
t1_dszta11	0	*	It's because investigations like this take time. It took two years for the Watergate Seven to be indicted. 
t1_dszq7qu	1	*	He still hasn't enacted the latest round of sanctions, even though it's passed. Also going outright to remove previous sanctions would of created chaos.
t1_dszsqun	1	*	Just a small loan... And then everything he inherited once the old fucker died.  Anyone who believes that he's built an empire of wealth is an idiot.
t1_dt00ky7	1	*	Brainwashed would typically be hyperbole but the Trump supporters Ive interacted with are definitely at cult level. 
t1_dt0i9cl	1	*	After more than a year I would tell you that the ship is sinking with regards to the dossier, but there never even was a ship.

t1_dt0aj6g	1	*	*Looks at government shut down*   ... You sure about that?
t1_dt0mdcp	1	*	He's been great for rich people for sure. That's about it though.
t1_dtivupc	0	*	Actually, Mythbusters tried that and discovered that it would be pretty unlikely to get electrocuted while urinating, since it's not exactly a steady stream.
t1_dtitc8m	1	*	Except I pay taxes that pay for the road so.....
t1_dtj2tc1	0	*	I'd bet from their point of view the more people you have stretched out and obviously stranded by delays the worse it looks on them. Gotta maintain that image, even at actual customers expense.
t1_dtiyqan	0	*	They arent people. Humans who contribute nothing to society (and even worse, detract from it), should be held on no higher a moral pedestal than pigs, chickens, or rats. 
t1_dtiuxz0	1	*	Not only that but cities and larger towns ship out their homeless to other places, local hostel has three new guys this week, one from Leeds and two from Manchester.
t1_dtj48pv	1	*	Singapore is a 'fine' city. 
t1_dtir8iy	1	*	in practice, the only thing that happens is the fuck the homeless policies though.

t1_dtjdvxl	1	*	How many do you have living with exactly?
t1_dtiyk9k	1	*	Those are the rules. It's a perfectly credible source when it's saying the correct thing.
t1_dtiz1bl	0	*	Absolutely, and it looks like you can overcome not being able to sleep on this bench with five minutes and a screwdriver.
t1_dtiyr5t	1	*	I thought CA was so loving and welcoming.
t1_dtimpbh	1	*	Dude... You know he's not actually gonna do it, right?
t1_dtivwxx	1	*	THIS IS VERY COMFORTING, FELLOW HUMAN!
t1_dtje3ak	1	*	Spooning with a bench....I always wanted to be the little spoon 
t1_dtj3app	0	*	It should be against the law the own a dog/cat/whatever if you're homeless. You can't take care of yourself, you have no business taking care of an animal.
t1_dtjn8vl	1	*	You can still be comfortable without stretching across 4 seats with your dirty feet on one of them and sleeping. 
t1_dtiz3ds	1	*	And just like that, homelessness subsides!
t1_dtjkttt	0	*	Its New York fuckin City, pal 
t1_dtjc6p9	0	*	Airports weren't really designed to be 6 hour hang outs.  
t1_dtiyro9	1	*	One thing I know about people who have been homeless or lived outdoors for a long time is that they are often claustrophobic. 
t1_dtiz0g3	0	*	> they dont like the rules imposed on them in the shelters. No drinking or drugs or smoking.  0 sympathy for people like this
t1_dtj9dx1	1	*	Would be pretty mad if you could buy a multi million pound pub chain without verifying your identity.
t1_dtipfjg	1	*	you must be new to reddit...  ;)
t1_dtj1zuf	0	*	Imagine having 3 hours until your flight but you can't sit down because there are people taking up 3 seats at a time by sleeping on them. 
t1_dtiuqw6	1	*	Ah, the old homeless easy mode problem. Yeah, I live in Vancouver. I know your pain.
t1_dtjaxua	0	*	>They are a public nuisance.  They are human beings in need of compassion and help, not your spite.
t1_dtj8mre	1	*	This is reality.
t1_dtj1xz4	0	*	Gosh yeah let's spare a minute for the inhumanity of your air travel in a thread about homelessness.
t1_dtjdy7l	1	*	Especially bizarre when you need to have a boarding pass to get into the secured area, so you know there's no way that some homeless guy is gonna be trying to sleep there.  It's all travelers.
t1_dtj36w4	1	*	If you were too comfortable you would have no incentive to fly business class and get access to the lounge 
t1_dtk6hhb	1	*	So you're starting a foundation and will be it's first donor? How noble.
t1_dtj0m2e	1	*	Well....that is certainly true.  I think it's implied that if we are going to fund UBI we would have already funded our mental health programs to help these troubled individuals.  
t1_dtiyfcb	0	*	Happy Cake Day Stranger!
t1_dtj8z6g	1	*	I know, right? They should install some fucking bunk beds at least.

t1_dtjvgmd	0	*	If people are mentally ill drug addicts that refuse to get help, and are rude and aggressive, there is way more going on there than laziness. But who would even hire such a person? 
t1_dtiz06l	1	*	Maybe we should make all of them work as labourers and manually expand the Channel. Deals with the homless and Brexit!
t1_dtj7h8f	0	*	The homeless are a significantly larger threat than skateboarders. In pretty much every way imaginable.

t1_dsrwsou	1	*	There's plenty useful ones, although they are going to be used in supply chains and other business use cases. Not so much as currency for value transfer.
t1_dssnsxj	0	*	For real it's tempting to buy more but I'm not fool enough to put in money I'm not willing to lose
t1_dsrzr2v	1	*	Yeah, I have bought into ethereum. It seems like the more evolved version of bitcoin.

t1_ds1dhm5	1	*	I think a lot of Israelis are for this. They have to buy us weapons with their money. The US didn't want another arms dealer in the region.
t1_ds1wo52	1	*	Yeah and saying it in diplomatic language clearly doesn't help when it comes to any country like Pakistan.    Granted Trump's language might not be the best either, but still
t1_ds1c98j	1	*	The US protects their people who lied about the Iraqi WMD, which led nearly half a million people dying.  Also set up ISIS.

t1_dt9y6y6	0	*	They have laws against shit like trivialising Nazism, for good reason, which calling someone a Nazi because you get frustrated does.   
t1_dt9wtvu	1	*	lol americans, I don't even know what to say anymore
t1_dt9ykhp	1	*	Same here. I was raised in Augsburg until I moved to the US in 4th grade. You tell anyone on the basketball team that theyll call you Nazi 24/7.
t1_dta1uy6	1	*	She claims she was calling an American behind her a nazi because he was wearing an undercut, which obviously makes him a nazi.
t1_dt9pcdp	0	*	I also consider the american government to be nazis
t1_dt9xlgl	1	*	Meanwhile my German American friends (American friends who have German ancestors way up the line, for anyone confused) love to make nazi jokes about themselves. Especially with my Jewish friends. 
t1_dta79bt	1	*	Yea because that happens. Solid argument
t1_dt9z0p3	1	*	>instead of the Nazi-looking man behind her with the Hitler youth haircut.  She should call karma police instead
t1_dtaflpo	1	*	The word isn't illegal, but is highly insulting given the history of it. I think too many people are caught up on it being a cop suing, but that's about the worst thing you could call a German
t1_dt9zaou	0	*	Let's keep it real here: this thread is gonna be about American police just as well. 
t1_dt9y21t	0	*	She previously worked for RAND Corporation. Explains...everything. 
t1_dt9ymfl	1	*	Thank you for your research.  
t1_dta2gl5	0	*	No tragedy ever happened with liquids on flights.  
t1_dta3lzx	0	*	changed
t1_dt9zd3k	1	*	This woman is educating your children America... AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
t1_dt9wlqc	1	*	As someone who might enjoy meetings for any of those groups in a genuime fashion, I am tickled pink this is her character. Hoowee.
t1_dt9zqt2	0	*	Happened right on her watch one could say
t1_dtad402	1	*	This I can confirm
t1_dta9ux9	0	*	Yup some ultra-liberal professor. How did she get a job at any Ivy League school with that mentality?
t1_dta0hu0	1	*	 I'm not even from Germany, but the second my schoolmates found out my grandfather was....oh boy...
t1_dtb3ide	0	*	The pro Islamist jackboots ?
t1_dta2m6l	1	*	And Trump is her leader. Why act surprised... 
t1_dtahyfc	1	*	Im sorry here is a downvote /s 
t1_dtahl3s	1	*	HuffPost. Say no more 
t1_dta0bzm	1	*	Or more broadly:  Idiot American thinks her protected speech extends beyond U.S. borders
t1_dt9wumn	1	*	It's for the oppression points, bro. Gotta rack 'em up so you can impress all the other oppressed people.
t1_dtaodib	1	*	> Provosts Distinguished Associate Professor, Georgetown University  How does a person like that get a position like this? Serious question.
t1_dt9xhn1	1	*	Same, coming from Poland. The poland invaded jokes seemed endless in middle school.   Was also called a communist, (lol) jew (im catholic) and other slurs
t1_dt9wpq5	0	*	Well, at least you learned a valuable lesson.
t1_dta4ioa	0	*	BEST REPLY EVER! you are a stupid american or a stupid russian..  lol  tell me how you want to suck putins dick
t1_dta7gt5	1	*	Maybe it was, like, cold...and therefore kinda waxy solid. Duh.
t1_dt9yln4	0	*	> you are called a Nazi, White Supremacist, Sexist, Bigot, Racist, Nazi, Homophobic or Transphobic.  If you're being called those a lot, you may be the one with the problem.
t1_dt9wne3	0	*	Wow, you fucks will flip on any issue. Now y'all are defending Nazis and how they'd treat people. For fucks sake. 
t1_dtanckk	0	*	Is this the point where we point out that she's Jewish?
t1_dta7dnm	1	*	You can call a Neo nazi nazi.. but you wont find a police officer who is officially a Neo nazi.. so its slander and will be punished. 
t1_dta3po4	0	*	Is it actually truthful to say every cop kills everyone they have a problem with in America? Because I'm pretty sure that's a pure fantasy.
t1_dtam42p	1	*	No it's not. Sometimes the littlest things are what break the camels back. For all you know her day was already shitty and this one thing added on top of it just set her off.
t1_dtahpgr	1	*	No. That's not what Nazi means.
t1_dtawyk6	1	*	These rules haven't proven to be reliable tho.
t1_dta1zwj	0	*	It is an insult, but it is also an opinion. They are words.
t1_dt9zeep	1	*	It gets better indeed 
t1_dt9x4oa	1	*	Well I mean... Look where she comes from. Wait. She's from a shithole country right??
t1_dt9wgwm	1	*	Skipping history class during the world wars sections because people were too stupid to tell the difference. Yep, ik that game.
t1_dta241g	1	*	On top of that we've diluted the term by calling everyone who disagrees with us a Nazi.
t1_dt9vgnd	0	*	I don't know where you're from, but in most civilized country, insulting someone is prohibited.
t1_dt9xz0r	0	*	Germany has laws against trivialising Nazism, which she did.
t1_dtal834	1	*	Solid propellant in sealed container could be explosive.
t1_dt9zgch	1	*	Jeez, reading that (and I couldn't finish it) just reminded me of every other entitled, self-important professor I know. I really hope she loses. 
t1_dtaeunf	1	*	Germany is a third world country??
t1_dta1mkk	1	*	All-out SJW until it is inconvenient.
t1_dtaxsuj	1	*	There isn't a law here specifically about Nazi stuff.
t1_dt9xltu	1	*	tried reading her twitter. Just, urgh. How do some people get to positions of influence? 
t1_dta549b	1	*	Sounds like a typical female
t1_dt9who7	1	*	Sounds still worse than being sued.
t1_dt9whoq	1	*	>If this woman called them an insult that was not Nazi related Im sure nothing would have happened to her.  Insulting police is treated quite seriously here. 
t1_dtalz7f	1	*	Luckily we just have one here. We stole it from a lady we just harassed...
t1_dt9z7q3	1	*	the c stands for cunt 
t1_dta09x6	0	*	*nazi laws
t1_dtbsn30	0	*	Are you serious?  Slander, look it up. The clue is in the damn title of the post. 
t1_dta8c95	0	*	I'm pretty sure that connotation of Nazi has been used for decades in the U.S., we just have more ready access to people throwing it around thanks to social media.
t1_dt9xbud	1	*	>but apparently doesn't understand why there is a limit to what you can bring on a plane in your hand luggage.  Look, she sounds like a real bitch, but a solid is not a liquid.
t1_dt9zbtv	1	*	Aziz Ansari. Plus much of the accusations go to press and television stations and never to the police.
t1_dta0itl	0	*	Which is beyond frustrating for any german, let me tell you.
t1_dta30lw	0	*	Sure. I called my friend who is a cop a dirty cunt yesterday. And he is a bastard by definition so thats his nickname I call him ya dirty bastard. Good fun, never been arrested for it.
t1_dt9wr3g	1	*	Along with breaking thier laws.
t1_dtazw1a	1	*	I'm just scrolling down for the old I did na zi that coming joke.  Still looking.
t1_dta031y	0	*	Many German people are nazis. 
t1_dta3zjm	1	*	Wow what an asshat
t1_dt9xvx0	1	*	Thats what happens when you trivialise Nazism in a country that has laws (for good reason) against trivialising Nazism.
t1_dt9zzbh	1	*	never mind I misread what you wrote, sorry.
t1_dta55zy	1	*	But they do though lol
t1_dtaaupd	1	*	That is insane and makes zero sense.
t1_dtaybez	0	*	All this is telling me is that your principles concerning justice can be eschewed if you hate the other person enough.
t1_dtagndg	1	*	what's even more ironic is that she's in the Peace and Security Studies Program there...
t1_dt9yvsd	1	*	Even when I moved to the UK I got the same jokes... Kids are cruel man 
t1_dta2fw6	0	*	So true. I judge a lot of people based on how they react to small inconveniences
t1_dta2bfw	0	*	Haha thank you for proving my point once again. Anyone who is a republican is now a white supremacist. Once again, check yourself.   
t1_dt9ynzn	1	*	Actual nazis?
t1_dta1me7	0	*	You can only call each other hateful names in America. 
t1_dtafkxo	1	*	In the rest of Europe, police don't shoot people, and we have some degree of respect for freedom of speech and opinion.
t1_dt9yzdi	1	*	I would describe it more as the advantage and disadvantaged rather than strong/ not strong. Having money does not make you strong, and not having money does not make you weak. 
t1_dta684u	1	*	What a fucking cunt she is! I have no other words. 
t1_dtagmlj	0	*	You see, there is nothing as peaceful as the moment after the complete eradication of your enemy.
t1_dtaqk3e	1	*	If a man did the exact same thing in America he'd be the biggest hero in Reddit history and the whole thread would be about how much airport security is literal Nazis.  
t1_dt9xakx	1	*	Speak for yourself mate. 
t1_dta1g3d	0	*	Not sure you understand the phrasing if you, in one sentence, say they have freedom of speech until they don't...
t1_dtah5uv	1	*	Sure all police in the us gets fucked daily.. thats why they walk like cowboys.. sore assholes.
t1_dtateca	0	*	Where are you saying? In Germany or the USA?
t1_dtau3py	0	*	Canadian here. You can call us Canadians, Canucks, whatever. Just don't make fun of us, we won't make fun of you.
t1_dtaf3pg	1	*	You still have a right to say 'hate speech' in USA
t1_dta1a03	1	*	the TSA is probably more nazi than all of germany combined.
t1_dtaj5xk	0	*	There is not.
t1_dtaj9xx	1	*	Is it wrong if I was hoping the woman would be a feminist sjw student?  I meant the reality is just as good but I just think it would have been better 
t1_dtabkhs	1	*	I'd rather stink than use 4711!
t1_dta3sdw	1	*	Haha wow.. She probably won't be for much longer. 
t1_dt9wmpt	0	*	Where does that definition of liberal come from? 
t1_dtaluxf	0	*	It's alright but ya mum does it better
t1_dta65ui	1	*	>Fair is known to have spent time working as a low-cost option in a variety of red light districts.  Probably an inaccurate edit, but lol. 
t1_dtc424m	1	*	This isn't slander though 
t1_dta3hmq	1	*	Most planes land safely... never makes the news because it doesn't stimulate the vulgar interest of a public voracious for novelty and outrage.
t1_dt9x5n5	0	*	Her own, obviously extremely one sided and defensive article paints her in such a bad light that you just know the objective truth is way way worse.
t1_dta8z0r	1	*	Sure the woman was an asshole.. but isn't it ridiculous that insulting people is a crime?  The article mentioned even calling someone a moron would do that.. thats not even bad..
t1_dta4c6q	0	*	What the fuck
t1_dta5q36	1	*	ahhhh sweet irony!
t1_dtads2c	0	*	As I said to the other poster: learn about history, and stop throwing around terms you clearly have no understanding of. 
t1_dt9y18h	1	*	Well said.
t1_dt9vwqm	0	*	yup.. might get you in trouble if the guy presses charges in front of civil court.  if you do it to a police officer in uniform you will end up in front of a criminal court
t1_dtaco0a	1	*	I think a high percentage of Americans think Spain is in south America and Hungary is not a country. No offense intended.  I mean... I perfectly understand they think the roll-on is solid.
t1_dta9bek	1	*	She forgot she wasn't on twitter
t1_dtbcxvt	1	*	Germany proper, I had no issues...their Airport customer service sucks balls, worse than States
t1_dtageqj	1	*	If this is true then she was in the right until.she called them.nazis I think. 
t1_dtabmrh	1	*	Well, you're not wrong.
t1_dt9xkro	0	*	Haha I'm laughing a lot thinking about that
t1_dt9qunz	0	*	That video game stuff isn't a law but a legal precedent nobody challenges, as that would A) be taking a lot of money and more importantly B) hold off the release of your game for possibly years.
t1_dt9y0bw	1	*	Seems consistent with my idea of political science people.  T. a philosophy student
t1_dt9tmrd	1	*	Just sprinkle some crack on him, let's get out of here
t1_dta0tgr	1	*	She mostly spends her time defending drone strikes. What a piece of shit.
t1_dtaq8nj	1	*	Can confirm, used to work at the airport for very large airline
t1_dta2f9t	1	*	Why do they shoot you after they got you to submit? Seems like overkill. 
t1_dtauu0k	1	*	In Germany, the inviolability of human dignity trumps absolute free speech. Not every country is the USA and not every culture is the same.
t1_dta0r8k	1	*	Fuck you, stink Nazi!
t1_dt9xhjz	1	*	Is it just me or is that the 'Hugh Mungus' lady?
t1_dt9yvqy	1	*	That's exactly how i Imagined her too look like
t1_dtab3dp	1	*	In her mind, she thinks [this happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAuooUf5G6I).
t1_dt9y3a7	1	*	Im guessing not, but trivialisng Nazism is. Want to guess what she did because she got stopped in an airport?
t1_dta3v1i	1	*	>  Augsburg Germany  Cool, your city is twinned with mine here in scotland!
t1_dt9rz1m	1	*	That's not what that means, and besides, this was in Germany.
t1_dt9zu2n	1	*	The fact that you can sue someone for saying something to you in Germany is downright disgusting 
t1_dta91db	1	*	so, you're a suburban white guy who drives a crossover, huh?
t1_dta11oc	1	*	I have no idea the police in Germany are so petty and litigious. 
t1_dta1qru	1	*	[Awkward...](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/couple-charged-with-assault-in-shooting-melee-during-uw-speech-by-milo-yiannopoulos/)
t1_dtblaev	1	*	If I could roll my eyes any harder, they would pop out of my head
t1_dtbkips	0	*	And you call them liberal retards for having... different political views? 
t1_dt9pb6t	1	*	Blue Lives Matter?
t1_dt9wtg4	1	*	Holy crap. Wow. That's amazing and insane. 
t1_dtaovsx	1	*	Hardly. She's a professor and probably got tenure.   But she should never have gotten the job in the first place.  I wonder how she got it.
t1_dt9xaw4	1	*	She got credentials, like a Bachelor in Social Sciences
t1_dt9v180	0	*	I'm so sorry for my moron fucking Americans... I love Germans German culture and history is wonderful and I'm glad you decided to come to America... God I hate Americans...
t1_dtan92e	1	*	Far enough.... my comment should say you don't call someone the N-word as opposed to you don't use the N-word
t1_dta7in4	1	*	/r/murderedbywords
t1_dta5lyx	1	*	I would have opened up the deodorant and dumped it in my hair.
t1_dt9yk8a	1	*	oh right...sue. still its pretty fucked up.  and i'm guessing you can go to jail if you disregard the lawsuit, as you should.
t1_dta0ugl	1	*	Ive read up a bit on this since it gets mentioned over and over in this thread but it seems its mostly about road rage in reality not directly the insults itself
t1_dt9xnjd	1	*	You might as well be a republican from the USA. We're all Nazis too. That's where the dumbass lady probably picked it up, from watching Don the drunk Lemon and Rachel how am I still employed Maddow.
t1_dta3oub	0	*	Sounds like something that could get the exchange student sent home??
t1_dtaasgr	1	*	Wow.  What a loser.  And fuck HuffPo for printing that garbage.  Anyone who considers it as a news source is delusional, biased, ignorant and stupid.
t1_dtaa1mx	1	*	Indeed!
t1_dta3lsw	1	*	Ok, not sure if missing a /s
t1_dt9ykyw	1	*	you'd be elected president?
t1_dta011g	1	*	senior political scientist with the RAND Corporation ooooook, think we're about done here
t1_dt9wixh	1	*	She looks like she would do something like that and then claim she was the victim.
t1_dta81ap	1	*	Worse - She has served as a Senior Fellow at West Points Combating Terrorism Center
t1_dt9zaeq	1	*	That would explain why Germany has the highest number of incarcerated per capit...oh wait.
t1_dta3l20	1	*	**GEORGETOWN?!!!**   Oh, how the mighty had fallen... 
t1_dtcsij1	0	*	Really. What you one be charged with? You can tell a cop to go fuck themselves... protected speech.
t1_dt9xd0s	1	*	Worse than killing 6 million Jews and millions of other people because you don't like them? Sorry if I don't feel that bad for you
t1_dt9ymw3	1	*	I'm in America, got made fun of for being both German and looking Jewish (... I had a large nose), so they intelligently called me a Jewish Nazi.   The kicker is I live in a very German area.
t1_dta1jo3	1	*	That IS pretty fascist, though.
t1_dta7wua	1	*	TIL Germany is a nice place in terms of digital privacy.
t1_dt9w1ws	1	*	Not the Lithuanians.
t1_dta3dor	1	*	She's so incredibly entitled. She doesn't even care about making her flight, she only cares about proving these brutes who dared question her Highness wrong. 
t1_dta98py	0	*	>headphones in both ears  You'd get a citation in US if the city was short in budget. 
t1_dta82rh	1	*	> Center for Peace and Security Studies  As a security professional I try to understand where I'm going before I show up.  There are no special American laws that protect me around the world.
t1_dta6bv0	1	*	>Georgetown    Well it didn't take long to figure out why 
t1_dtb8w7r	1	*	I think it was a stick deodorant.
t1_dt9xhdr	1	*	The best part is later when I asked him about it, he was like yeah Idk why I did that. They were being really nice and helping some drunk tourist drink some water.
t1_dta827d	0	*	True but that doesnt mean the law is good. If Trump tried to pass the same exact law in the U.S., all of reddit would explode with accusations of authoritarianism and whatnot.
t1_dtaa2ab	1	*	Jesus, she teaches at Georgetown.
t1_dt9xubf	0	*	No, I don't.  I just don't make some bad apples excuses for people who get paid taxpayer money to be professionals and then go out of their way to protect the violent criminals among them.
t1_dtavcpm	0	*	Uhh, pretty sure its legal in all countries to be racist. Opinions aren't illegal just because other people don't like them. (Personally I hate racism)
t1_dt9yf0f	1	*	Meh, the war on drugs is about the same has the nazis if you think about it for more than a minute or two. 
t1_dtamz5g	1	*	She probably also assumes all men are rapists until proven otherwise.
t1_dta5qr2	1	*	Well said. Some people just think their time is more valuable than everybody else around them.
t1_dta3q5d	0	*	Yes. She spoke her mind and it deemed to rise to slander will pay the price.   What's the problem?
t1_dt9zfcj	1	*	Yes, and don't be upset with me, I wasn't calling *you* a nazi, I was calling *him* a nazi, because that's okay for some reason!
t1_dt9w5ir	0	*	In the US, conversationally I see it used most for folks that are overly draconian.   The Soup Nazi for example. 
t1_dtak5sr	1	*	So that means the holocaust was ok because it was german law or culture, makes sense
t1_dtaucll	0	*	Words, like actions have consequences. If we can punish certain actions then we should punish certain words also. You're still free to have opinions and to say what you want in private. 
t1_dtaoe32	1	*	that wouldnt be that big a deal tho really unless you are uber rich...
t1_dta1q5d	0	*	I guess that's an insult if you like to hide your country's history and then get upset any time is is brought up. 
t1_dt9t9px	0	*	In Brazil you can go to jail for attacking a public officer verbally, also for using any Nazi symbol.
t1_dt9xgs6	1	*	Weird how no one has written about this airport deal yet on her bio. 
t1_dt9zhde	1	*	If 99/100 police interactions occur in the US without someone dying *that's still really fucking terrible*
t1_dtamj6z	1	*	I feel like using CollegeHumor as a source is phenomenally worse than using Wikipedia... [but](https://youtu.be/-LDzOi1dyAA)  
t1_dta2zt7	1	*	Because suing over speech is futile?
t1_dta1xpw	1	*	They're still stupid rules.
t1_dt9w4no	1	*	> thoughts  yeah no, im sure she used her mouth instead of her brain
t1_dtaluy1	1	*	Yeah, and everyone on Reddit hates those rules and calls it security theater.  But God forbid a woman doesn't know her place...
t1_dtafm3s	1	*	Yes, but those consequences should not include government persecution.  
t1_dt9wtcl	1	*	Looks like the kind of bitch that would act outwardly hostile to all her straight male students 
t1_dtbiael	1	*	Interesting. Thanks for clarifying.
t1_dt9tha9	1	*	??
t1_dtawsvb	0	*	I got internet 
t1_dt9u716	0	*	Germany has (many) laws regarding the use of Nazi slogans, imagery and the like. Calling someone a Nazi is a legitimate criminal offence there, just an fyi
t1_dta4qmb	1	*	Dude, you forgot her pro-drone stance :-)  >Fair's work and viewpoints have been the subject of prominent criticism. Her **pro-drone stance** has been denounced, and called surprisingly weak
t1_dta07fi	1	*	it's like we're in a computer simulation and the programmers are just messing with us.
t1_dtaftai	1	*	All this amounts to is nothing. LOL This is a fancy way of saying i waste rich peoples money.
t1_dtaucom	1	*	Yes and they are quite good for distributing liquid evenly, so they are definitely a good way to hide something. Even if she didn't. 
t1_dtalasa	0	*	And you are happy with that situation?
t1_dta09wv	1	*	When I'm in an airport in a foreign country I assume they're familiar with their countries laws so I shut the fuck up and do as they say. I'm not in a position to be arguing with anyone.
t1_dt9xv3r	1	*	Shoulda' kept her mouth shut with her unimaginative insults. Oh well.
t1_dta5cjt	1	*	No it's not... on her huffpost article she gave a picture of her (solid) lady speed stick
t1_dta9dbr	0	*	Some types are, some types aren't. Roll-on deodorant is a liquid (it's basically a giant ballpoint pen).
t1_dt9zgrp	1	*	He was kidding 
t1_dta08ca	0	*	This is the second time that I read my home city on Reddit, the first was when they found a bomb in 2016.
t1_dtau7uh	1	*	Roll-on deodorant is liquid. The bottle contains a liquid deodorant which is spread by the ball-bearing tip thing 
t1_dtaujkr	1	*	That was Germany of 80 years ago, not the Germany of today. Should you be responsible for your granparents actions? 
t1_dta3mto	0	*	Thanks. As an American, I wasnt aware of the differences. As a German, does it not bother you that the state has the authority to decide what is offensive and what isnt? 
t1_dt9zob1	1	*	You'd think she would know the difference between a Nazi and a policeman doing their job with a background like that. The stupidity of this is amazing, yet not at all surprising. 
t1_dt9sr3t	1	*	> it's so long ago  70 years is nothing in European history time.
t1_dt9wv3f	1	*	you heard it boys dont mess with this guy
t1_dt9zp24	1	*	I get the impression this woman would be annoying at parties.
t1_dta5xwo	0	*	No it's not too far. We like it, it works and i wouldn't want to have US Free Speech laws, they are plainly stupid. 
t1_dta8czp	1	*	I said a shitty week, and yes, it happened to me in the past. I always felt bad about it afterwards.
t1_dt9x87y	1	*	My nine years in the US sucked.The amount of racist comments and jokes I heard because I am Mexican were draining. 
t1_dta9c2w	0	*	Corrupt laws aren't excusable just because they're from Germany.
t1_dta9raj	1	*	I often see people commenting how american universities are a bad influence to young people. Got to say the evidence seems to be mounting quickly lately.
t1_dta0k6s	1	*	You realize most germans today weren't alive for that, right?
t1_dtb9t9f	1	*	The crack German police have seized my deodorantbut they dont seem to care about that Nazi-looking dude over there!  Unbelievably stupid woman. Typical entitled American idiot.
t1_dta7dv5	1	*	I can actually hear her getting off on her own self righteousness and it's disgusting.
t1_dtamr5e	1	*	It's just the behaviour I have observed in the past year. It's getting seriously out of hand.
t1_dta2ufb	0	*	We are all different of course its a huge country but I feel like we have such a bad reputation that some of us are trying to compensate.
t1_dtack3s	1	*	Heilport 
t1_dt9yc3z	1	*	Germany has laws against trivialising Nazism, which she did.
t1_dtav552	0	*	Damn, that bit about her menopause and describing her menstrual cycle in great detail really ties it all together, what a compelling read. 
t1_dtao6bs	1	*	It was a lady speed stick, its like a solid stick that you roll out.
t1_dta0g7z	1	*	Wow, I hope Im never a big enough fuck to get my own Wikipedia page for it.
t1_dtah8ta	1	*	Tbf usually they won't give you a ticket for calling them nazis, it's kinda common and secondly: atleast you can be sure that even if you really piss off a German cop, you won't get shot for it.
t1_dtap1jg	1	*	I had my California Medical MJ card.
t1_dt9th0c	0	*	Calling someone a Nazi is a crime in germany, as is insulting a policeman. She broke the law, of course she's getting sued

t1_duabpvy	1	*	Not the submitter's fault. They changed it. Good that they did, but it would have been even better if they noted in the article that they had corrected it.
t1_dua8qwe	1	*	hah, no... wikileaks *sometimes* has information that isn't otherwise known by the public.
t1_duabs10	1	*	Lol it made no difference whatsoever. None. The election was won because Bernie was a  loser, Hillary was crooked, and Trump didn't pull any punches.
t1_dua9vqk	1	*	Fox News would have benefited from her as well. Shitting on Hillary for 4 years would have boosted their already amazing ratings even higher.

t1_duqmchd	1	*	Money didn't win the election though, a better campaign strategy and message did.   Hillary spent more money. So how does it matter.   Also I highly doubt Russia gave any money to the nra.

t1_dur4yzv	0	*	Oil from Venezuela is usually used as heavy blending stock for US shale oil (which is too light). Lack of Venezuelan oil could become a problem for US terminals.
t1_dur7gor	0	*	Well, that's the only way it can function. So sad that people actually believe it could ever actually work.
t1_dur5xdt	1	*	I mean, you could look at all the times in history that it's worked.

t1_dsfhyu6	1	*	Same in the west, people prefer to believe alternative facts instead of the actual facts.
t1_dsf9uhp	1	*	Considering that serfdom still existed in Russia less than 200 years ago - I think that despite many  other flaws the early communists did an amazing job bringing education to the country.

t1_ds3cw1p	1	*	But the gap isnt because they are men or women...so
t1_dspx2bb	1	*	You're downvoted because the U.S. has a celebrity worship fetish.  Gates is a celebrity now, his PR has paid off.
t1_dsow8op	0	*	I think you give our 'elite' too much credit
t1_dsouxqs	1	*	I personally dont remember Gates being hated, I was born 8n the early 90s and havent done research.  I wonder if Bezos and zuckerberg will go through the same cycle as Gates
t1_dssemxb	1	*	Im bringing attention to an issue I think is important.  Go through my post history and revisit your claims of bitching...which is akin to nagging or constant beefing which I dont do.  
t1_dsolqvq	1	*	Dont get why you are getting so much hate, if people read into it more Im sure youd have fewer downvotes

t1_dspr3qq	1	*	Hell, in most of universities in my country they offer pretty much all of their software required for students (barring MS Office). They've spared me a few hundred/thousand dollars on software.

t1_dsoosqs	1	*	I really, really hate this line of thinking. I doubt when given the chance most people would give as generously as the Gates foundation has. What crab mentality.
t1_dsopxu1	0	*	I doubt it, there are not many wealthy people who actually help. Every rich person has a charity though, but it is just to just avoid taxes.
t1_dsp773v	1	*	All I know is that Apple was shit before & after Steve jobs
t1_dsoxs8y	1	*	Look at the Hughes Institute. [It was basically viewed as a tax haven initially.](https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Howard%20Hughes%20Medical%20Institute) Does great work.
t1_dsoxnv3	1	*	Interesting....
t1_dsolfcx	0	*	So everyone waits to get their billion or hopes someone else does something?  Seems like an easy excuse.

t1_dsp0bb8	1	*	Thats an excuse its all relative 
t1_dsc2bnj	0	*	Yes, but he's a symptom of a corrupt and venial system that is devolving into a blend of theocracy & autocracy, where democracy was sold to the rich and powerful a few decades ago
t1_due26h4	1	*	Now if we can just convince the government that this should also apply to government spy agencies, we're in business.
t1_dudngtt	0	*	Yeah, there's no point in banning Facebook if AmigoLink or something replaces it and does the same stuff.

t1_dslph71	1	*	I know right, its almost as if our last president didn't spend all 8 years of his term blaming Bush for everything that was bad.  Obama was a joke.

t1_dsknuui	1	*	Given who Sadiq Khan's direct predecessor was, I'm not sure that touting the better political judgement of Londoners is a particularly sound argument.
t1_dskog6h	1	*	I'd say it's actually about 5/6 now.
t1_dslr5a7	0	*	Khan got in at a time when it the atmosphere favored diversity for diversity sake.

t1_dsklbm5	1	*	I'm from just outside London. I don't think he could even get one word in six of me talking.  I'd have to put on me phone voice.

t1_dskzihm	0	*	YEah... that was the story after he did and people wondered why.  And research both written and spoken word from him - he has  deep dislike for the UK especially for their colonialism in Africa.

t1_ds84opo	0	*	The far-right was never in favor of any American wars of the last 30 years or more.  You can criticize them without resorting to absurd strawmen.

t1_dt82p2c	0	*	Or himself?
t1_dsuicr0	1	*	Right. How on earth did I miss that. Damn, 
t1_dtqaeif	1	*	The American way is socialism for the rich and market for the poor. Rich people fail upwards regardless of how many fuckups they accrue during their careers.
t1_dtqbofb	0	*	And giving everyone free money will do.. what?  Isnt this how inflation gets out of hand? Why arent these people protesting for the creation of new jobs? Why dont companies wanna be in Finland?

t1_du9ak39	0	*	How is .00003% of the Gaza population being denied entry into Israel based on security concerns unusual?
t1_du8d57z	1	*	>It gives the government ample leverage to legalize outposts, build new settlements, and expand existing settlements   None of this exists in Gaza since 2005, and were talking about Gaza here.
t1_du8gv1x	0	*	Israel has no legal obligation to guarantee their freedom of movement. They have the freedom to move within Gaza. Not inside Israel.
t1_du8lcf7	0	*	They also aren't the ones with an air and sea blockade of Gaza, which prevents Gaza from being able to import any medical supplies.
t1_du87psh	1	*	From an ideological standpoint, I agree with the sentiment you spoke here.
t1_du8gnmn	0	*	You think so...? 
t1_du8a8cx	0	*	Yeah because terrorists carry cards and have tattoos on their foreheads, this makes it easy to distinguish between civilians and terrorists.

t1_dub0z43	1	*	Having a dog in the fight means a personal stake in the outcome. Not having one does not mean you cannot form an opinion on the topic.

t1_dujdq3v	1	*	if only that money went for research - most of the yearly reports say that they cut R&D expenses while funneling money towards marketing..
t1_duipohu	1	*	Which wouldn't work, because the drug companies would just use shell entities and Hollywood Accounting to ensure that no profit ever shows up for a very very long time
t1_duhw9qf	0	*	Plus this kind of wastefulness is threatening the viability of Medicaid programs throughout the country. 
t1_duhyfws	1	*	My plan is, they either produce it for a reasonable profit, or noone will buy it. The product could be licensed to other sellers, who must pay them a percentage of anything sold.
t1_duhudi7	1	*	Hey, I've been getting generic Latisse from them for years! I'm honestly surprised they haven't been cut off from shipping here. How is it legal? 
t1_duhyalr	0	*	Theodore Roosevelt.  Can you explain it for me because I don't get it? :-)

t1_dtpvy6j	0	*	Burning coal is insanely bad for the environment. This isn't about left vs right.
t1_dtpteiu	0	*	Its not like they show up to work one day and the doors are locked & chained shut. Every employee knows its a dying method of power generation.
t1_dtpsnmh	1	*	High quality coal will still be mined for uses like the ones you suggest, but it would be far far less than the amount of coal simply burned for energy.
t1_dtprrku	1	*	Maintaining a load of power stations running at a loss (which also harm the environment) isn't necessarily the best way to maintain employment.
t1_dtqh4y4	1	*	Why not make it 3 out of 3 and close Merthyr too while you're at it? ^/s

t1_dv4w1f0	1	*	Sean Hannity probably had someone killed to help Trump.
t1_dv4s5c9	1	*	everything Trump says in a hostile tone is pure projection. It reveals how he really feels about himself.
t1_dv4tuvq	1	*	I dunno, his younger brother Joshua seems to have turned out ok.
t1_dv4rgir	1	*	Charles II of Spain, to be exact.
t1_dv4tfs2	1	*	Have my updoot for all the effort alone!
t1_dv4sab8	0	*	There's still people who think Hillary would've done a worse job as president than this administration so this line of thinking won't get through them.

t1_dv4w00u	1	*	Team players are a red flag to me
t1_dv51mbc	1	*	The longest-serving GOP Speaker of the House during the W years - Hastert - is a convicted paedo. You don't have to look very deep to find the projections.

t1_dv59fc9	1	*	Peanuts...
t1_dv4vvoa	1	*	Few.
t1_dv574fw	1	*	Saudi Arabia doesnt mold their foreign policy around Kushner's family's business. If this looks fishy to thinking people, then theyre not really thinking people.
t1_dv5z1fc	1	*	That was really interesting to read. It was clear and explained a lot to me. I can see how people can be stuck believing all of this and how you feel in the middle of that.
t1_dv4rdcs	1	*	Lol wtf whered you get that from
t1_dv4trri	1	*	A tomato. 
t1_dv55346	0	*	So in the interest of selective outrage, you would back throwing Clinton in jail as well as kushner, yes?

t1_dv4rsqm	1	*	Mmmn, when affluent privilege meets lawful good. 
t1_dv4tqaf	1	*	Are we dividing everything into good and bad like we're simpleton retards now, instead of trying to understand political nuance? 
t1_dv4rorx	1	*	No no no.   They do it first, then justify it by saying everyone else does too.

t1_dv4t1h8	1	*	Holy shit have an upvote
t1_dv4xgld	1	*	I hope he crosses some Russian or Saudi oligarch and gets popped for it. It's not like our government is going to do anything about him.
t1_dv5b0zy	1	*	This, this, this!!
t1_dv5bhzp	1	*	When you think of him in terms of having ushered in the literal devil, I kind of get behind the Obama is the antichrist thing.
t1_dv4qx38	0	*	A look though your history makes me believe you're British, in which case you don't really have much room to stand on.
t1_dv4t5uq	0	*	Well written.
t1_dv4t5d8	1	*	Let's first dispense with the notion that Kushner doesn't know what he's doing. He knows *exactly* what he's doing...

t1_dv55ydv	1	*	Used to do such a thing.  And still should. But we have a course correction to the far ignorant and likely malicious.    Lets vote a bit more and fix this. 
t1_dv5vadm	1	*	Good! Hopefully it's been dumped down the bottom of the thread because it's people changing the subject.
t1_dv5ynd9	1	*	Yeah but how did they keep it and make it bigger?
t1_dv5bbzy	1	*	Actually they do care about being re-elected so they can continue stealing and being corrupt pieces of shit for another four years.
t1_dv56o5x	1	*	Which is even more rich if you know anything about Watergate.
t1_dv87ncv	0	*	False dichotomy, I'd like to see them both succeed. If some nation must suffer for them to grow and improve (unlikely) let it be some Latin American or middle eastern one.
t1_dv4ytao	1	*	> watergate  that's how you get a really large bill...and that florida man
t1_dv4taml	1	*	This is exactly what happened to his daddy-in-law and why Don Putin owns his ass to this very day.

t1_duurlaa	1	*	Except he still wouldn't win
t1_duvn95h	1	*	you're assuming that Navalny actually has some legitimate amount of support from the Russian citizens.  he's not as popular in Russia as  people on Reddit like to imagine he is.

t1_dtzkzws	0	*	Well he has one point that Japan would never do what the UK did with the EU, with China and other neighbouring countries.
t1_du05tlw	1	*	True. I just do not think the British public had a fair shake at what the terms were. Its covering one eye while trying to complete a puzzle before you.

t1_dujcros	1	*	Whew lad
t1_dujxo0u	1	*	Depending on whom you ask! France helped US and Poland. They fought against evil GB and Russia.
t1_dujfo5a	0	*	It's not a question of expenditure, it's a question of operational capacity. The fucking Paraguayan Army can deploy its resources faster than der Germans.
t1_dujlm7h	1	*	Germany's tanks *are* considered among the most capable in the world. All 250 of them.  Germany is a huge manufacturer of high-end weaponry, it's just all for export.
t1_dtqjpgf	1	*	Microbreweries = local breweries.
t1_dtq7rqf	0	*	America's biggest beer brands are in foreign hands as well. Beer is an extremely globalized industry.

t1_dtuecok	1	*	You are absolutely correct my man!
t1_ds8dn7e	0	*	approx. 45% of the Iranians going to uni are women. Iran produces more female engineers than you can imagine.

t1_ds8igcu	1	*	Maybe they should be?
t1_ds9be78	1	*	I wouldn't say Iran and Russia are super close but that's in part because Russia is economically weak so can't oppose USA-led block too much. 
t1_ds8zdf3	0	*	 the terrorists in the ME are sunni funded in big part by the saudis. In fact Iran fought against ISIS.
t1_dsaaw2x	1	*	Yea, Rex Tillerson dissolved the state department office of sanctions enforcement. So nobody is doing anything about the NK, Iran, Russia, and Turkey sanctions.

t1_dsom9tn	0	*	Yah but we could use it as an excuse to build a giant russian tank slaying mecha-tiger. Although personally I don't think we should really need an excuse for that.

t1_dsomja0	0	*	So, the bad news is that redditors don't have a place to chat anymore.  Mr. Putin, fire away.
t1_dsp18mt	1	*	Yeah, the principle of MAD is that you show the other side your capabilities. Secret orbital nukes doesn't buy much, except maybe a Goldeneye-style EMP-only weapon.
t1_dsp4wps	1	*	Yah exactly people should watch salmonellas video on it 
t1_dsp2lpw	1	*	The 1980s called, they want their foreign policy back. He was just jealous because the 1970s called to tell him their foreign policy didn't work.
t1_dsp48hj	0	*	Makes salting the earth at Carthage look innocent in comparison.

t1_dsp4fvx	1	*	If you wanted to attack Russia with a torpedo, you can hit St Petersburg, Kalingrad, and that's about it.
t1_dspeubv	0	*	Isn't that literally the plot of one of the recent Mission Impossible movies? 
t1_dspeiya	1	*	Also can do funny things in geologically unstable areas like San-Francisco. Soviets were reported to utilize that split in their nuclear strike plans.
t1_dspkd7x	1	*	It can't be!
t1_dsol07o	1	*	U0001f609
t1_dsp0lih	0	*	Yeah youd need a Saturn 5 just to launch a single warhead that big.
t1_dsoki35	0	*	The American version wasn't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/DRC-8_Emergency_Rocket_Communications_System
t1_dspenm3	0	*	The Atlantic ocean is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY bigger than you apparently realize.
t1_dsp6u3w	0	*	> evil  How irradiating US with cobalt is somehow more evil than glassing Russia with ICBMs? MAD is not about being kind, but about showing your opponent that you can strike back.
t1_dsp15ip	1	*	Terrorists wouldnt have a hard time sneaking a nuclear bomb into the borders of the U.S or in a major city  they could just put it in one of the trucks full of drugs already crossing the border. 
t1_dspb3go	1	*	Man that castle bravo video was crucial. Im 30 years old and Ive never seen that one. Absolutely terrible what we did to those people and the planet for that matter. Thanks for sharing that video!

t1_dspy9ap	1	*	Actually the way megatons work, when you double the megatons it is around 10x more powerful IIRC. It is more like 10 TSAR Bombs.
t1_dspfszd	0	*	Man. People who cant enunciate shouldnt try making educational videos. I could barely understand what that dude in the castle bravo vid was saying. Slurring all over the place 
t1_dsox6dc	1	*	Yes reddit is full of self assured idiots. I wish there was some weapon to eliminate them. Maybe camps? 
t1_dsp9b9w	0	*	Well that depends entirely on how you interpret /u/skaconut's statement. By general population does he mean general population of the entire world? If so then it wasn't the case for most of history 
t1_dsoxs86	1	*	Ah, but the one that was designed, not the one that was tested. There's the 100mt Tsar Bomba, the largest ever designed.
t1_dsopxim	1	*	Son of a cyka*
t1_dspaim0	1	*	The guy later became famous under his alias Sean Connery. He was so bad at impersonating an American that the witnesses protection program gave him a Scottish backstory. 
t1_dsp3mnz	1	*	But if you don't get the President of the United States on that phone, you know what's gonna happen to you?  You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola company..
t1_dsop71g	1	*	And upholding the principals of MAD is why they invaded Ukraine to stop them joining EU and NATO. 
t1_dsp79em	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWSMoE3A5DI  I think this video gives a better sense of scale. The bomb is far smaller but it's still incomprehensibly huge 
t1_dtsps1u	0	*	Thee glamthrowers raised money for a project for the company. The roadster is needed as ballast.

t1_dsrlxrt	0	*	Unless you were saying the same thing between 2008 and 2016, this is empty drivel. And if you were, you were still being fallacious.
t1_dsrufsj	1	*	But you're holding up 4 fingers
t1_dsrv6ck	1	*	Kim Jong Un isn't a lunatic. He is incredibly rational. In point of fact he seems to be making great strides in eliminating North Korea's status as a Chinese vassal state.
t1_dss4lq9	1	*	It's about the fact that you're agreeing with a piece of shit dictator because you don't like Trump.   You're acting like Kim has any credibility. His opinion doesn't mean shit. 
t1_dsrt9cc	1	*	Reminds me of some sort of MST3K insult.
t1_dsrym9q	1	*	Nah Kim is just out doin shit, he only checks his insta/twitter every couple days. Trump is snapchat filter fieeeeend bro
t1_dsrn31h	1	*	He said the same exact thing first. How is he the voice of reason?
t1_dsro1sm	0	*	mmm yes, call me a Russian. Like that means shit.
t1_dsswms5	1	*	Are you saying the KKK are behind this?!?!?!?!!?

t1_dssqvnq	1	*	I'm pretty sure the country's elite live well. If so there is a poverty line it's just that nearly everyone is below it.
t1_dsrr5oy	1	*	Should have just waited for the next one
t1_dsrwjvx	0	*	They just waited for the American public to predictably forget about it.  But since it's still staying, they grew impatient 
t1_dsrwh10	1	*	Distinction without a difference. 
t1_dsrnuj4	1	*	What we should be saying is its kinda sad that some things they say about Trump arent wrong.
t1_dsrumde	0	*	It's getting ridiculous.
t1_dsrrqwl	1	*	Ambiguous hacks
t1_dsrmzx1	1	*	It takes one to know one. They mirror eachother. 
t1_dss0c1k	1	*	Not to mention that crybaby temper-tantrum libs are actually on his side now.  LOL
t1_dsrn76s	1	*	No, Koreans eat uc6b0ub3d9. Udon is the English spelling. /s  Forreal though, udon is also Japanese.
t1_dsrqek2	1	*	You seriously are making a distinction here because of the medium of communication over the substance of it? 
t1_dssx1ab	0	*	I don't think it's a vast majority, barely were a majority in the elections...
t1_dsrqsgi	1	*	Its a military strategy. One that has been successful before
t1_dsrnnud	1	*	kinda helps with the opinion of such a person though doesn't it. 
t1_dsrkonc	1	*	You gotta admit... the Cold War had a [certain elegance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident) to it. 
t1_dsrmp13	1	*	He's no voice of reason.  
t1_dsrvlpr	0	*	Where do you get your information from?
t1_dsroetd	1	*	I know they do that, but they have state sponsored meida. I was wondering more if they would even mention Twitter, or if they would just say he said the line.
t1_dsrmlob	0	*	Then fucking go live there if he's so great...  He's the one that started the button bullshit, remember?
t1_dsrycyk	1	*	I don't want to see his balls.
t1_dsrmj8s	1	*	Run by the world's most powerful cunt.
t1_dsrr5vm	1	*	Thank you.  I thought I was missing something.
t1_dsrpb60	0	*	The whole point is to attack trump on the button remark. But Kim did it himself. They literally called him a lunatic when Kim said it. Its hypocritical and others are attacking him for what?   
t1_dsrpu71	0	*	You should post lots of stuff saying how bad he is on social media then downvote all of Kim's postings.   Edit: Guess I needed this.../s
t1_dsrlqrg	1	*	He does this on purpose to make America distrust leaders more 
t1_dsrwkfj	0	*	The French have a cool/useful term for that, they call it [l'esprit d'escalier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier) or 'staircase wit'
t1_dsrr237	1	*	But have you listened to those *fat*, ***FUNKY*** beats on DJ Kim Jong ILLEST's final mixtape?
t1_dsrubjo	1	*	I'm going with jerk store! Jerk Store is the line! Jerk Store!  Edit: Once again, reddit beats me to the punchline. Sorry.
t1_dsrwnts	1	*	Shut Up Becky!
t1_dss1db1	0	*	It is fun, isnt it?
t1_dsrtty7	0	*	Think you might be wrong on that one.  Plenty of places still have recent stories of this.   It was a defector that stated that.
t1_dss4ds9	1	*	Also, they do seem to be experts in the spasms of lunatics so I'm gonna file this under the things to not criticise NK about. Cause even a broken clock can be right twice a day.
t1_dsrzn82	1	*	What a leotard
t1_dsrms7k	0	*	....are we talking about Kim or Trump?
t1_dsrh8fv	1	*	The point is we don't want a fucking man baby capable of ending the world in nuclear fire.
t1_dsrqh7k	1	*	If this were the response, no part of me would be surprised if Trump tweeted a pic of himself t-bagging a big red button in the oval office. 
t1_dsrom9s	0	*	Don't think anyone does that. Rather, we reflect on how bad it's become that NK leadership looks almost normal by comparison.
t1_dssjrle	1	*	I'm sorry, can you re-read my post and tell me where you got that from?

t1_dsl29wh	1	*	Some how I read bigly somewhere in there.
t1_dsljfvq	1	*	I can imagine that after a (hostile?) takeover of a company the party doing the taking would want to clean house. Not unheard of in business and not necessarily a precursor to failure either.

t1_dskzhv3	0	*	NPR reported that 31 Republican members of Congress will not seek re-election, so...that's something. Maybe.
t1_dsl61wy	1	*	No you cant. Canadas immigration system is fairly strict.

t1_dsl1sd0	1	*	Well see, there ya go. The best president ever (ol ronny) held the record. Trump outdoing him is really only following a pattern of success. Trust me, it's all part of daddy trump's plan. 
t1_dsl1h9m	1	*	LMFAO Leader of the world because we were looked up to. It never had anything to do with our economy or our military.   I cant with this one. I CANNOT. 
t1_dslnsiw	1	*	I just tried yesterday to explain to a co-worker that we're now a joke to the world. People still believe the rest of the world worship us.

t1_dsl3r3n	1	*	We don't need a revolution against the government (well maybe, but impossible) so much as we need an armed invasion of malicious media like Fox or banks like Goldman-Sachs.

t1_ds9tvyv	1	*	Is Tim Hortons like Subway where they're franchise only so they don't have to hold individual stores accountable? That's the reason I haven't been in a Subway in years.

t1_du6x1m1	0	*	Trudeau just inferred that his entire country is racist, and blamed them for it.  Apparently, hiring unqualified black MP's will solve this racism that nobody knew they had until today.

t1_dsd3ohn	1	*	I'm pretty sure America gave the world Trump
t1_dsd8rw9	1	*	The story was already out there.  People who were going to read were going to buy the book, for the most part.  This helps to knock FnF off of the bestseller list, aiding in burying the story.

t1_dss9qh6	0	*	As if. Their ranks are thinning as it is, imagine what would happen if they purged the rapists. Fuck the church, it's a parasite of society.

t1_dt485w6	0	*	Don't install them if you don't like that.
t1_dt4amqc	1	*	Really. If there is an app I want, and I understand the privacy implications of installing it, then what business do you have telling me I can't install it?
t1_dv10ygf	1	*	Thanks Ken
t1_dup1ce5	1	*	neat fact spartacus, but he was commenting on the spelling
t1_dup3ifz	0	*	In your language it is still *spelled* Colombia.
t1_dtejo01	1	*	I dont blame you. Its not everyday that people talk about hookworms and allergies.
t1_dsx4o78	0	*	It's still sexist, no way around it. Should we ban all women from preschools since they are the overwhelming majority of the sexual abuse perpetrators there? 
t1_dt25eoj	1	*	Wetten Dass will be renewed.
t1_dv3dupi	1	*	This. It's what old school nerds wish Akihabara still was. Instead of the anime tourist trap it is now...
t1_dslk6r1	1	*	Yeah, but they *are* comparing the number of emigrants from each country as if each is equally significant
t1_dslk9ci	0	*	Or they're duel citizens.
t1_dslmwtu	1	*	That is quite impressive. But none became The President afaik.
t1_dulaslk	1	*	Including death camps and overall casualties, the poles probably suffered the worst out of all the groups, the nazis wanted them gone almost as much as they wanted the Jews exterminated, lebaunsraum.

t1_dukwqlx	1	*	I see that lol
t1_dulawgz	0	*	Not sure if you're joking, but this is wrong. First of all, it is Lebensraum. And that translates to space to live or living space. Living room would be Wohnzimmer.
t1_dul78bd	0	*	Serious question, why is it more appropriate to call a victim of Jewish descent shoah and not simply Jewish
t1_dukp2t8	0	*	Roma invaded Europe from India and the biggest victims of Hitlers race and space policy were Slavs.

t1_dt6dgld	0	*	So he could afford to fix it himself (and he did!) and youre suprised they decided he didnt need help?
t1_dt6mfle	1	*	Sadly government bureaucrats dont often have to be right in order to be right. It just depends on how they chose to interpret the regs that day.

t1_dtvaqxe	0	*	Well some Hindus love drinking cow piss.      If a religion mandated eating logs of shit I could see it happening. 
t1_ds5naje	1	*	That's worthy of debate

t1_dua6vjp	0	*	Just a bunch of bullets flying at high speed in close proximity to children. Nothing wrong with that. Fake news and propaganda.
t1_dua5k50	1	*	But they could have been. Let's face it, if you fire a gun you intend to hit something.
t1_dua4dzs	0	*	And there's plenty of evidence that throughout human history, the citizenry needed weapons to defend themselves against the government.  where did you think democracy came from?
t1_dua3f53	0	*	There was no massacre in Russia. There was 15 injured people. Not 17 dead like in Florida. Huge difference in outcomes.
t1_duauztr	1	*	Shoot pests, shoot an old farm dog ect.

t1_dua7ub5	1	*	Doesn't seem to be stopping them
t1_dua62iw	1	*	Yeah children don't have the best impulse control.  That's sort of what makes them children lol

t1_dua4xvc	1	*	Lol. I wrote basically this before I saw your comment. 
t1_dua4xno	1	*	Right, a professional soldier shot at police on the street. Good thing the students are not professional soldiers and don't shoot up police stations. 
t1_dua5854	1	*	if people dont accept it they will want action done to prevent it. ejaculating your hopes and prayers over twitter does shit. 
t1_dua2ptn	1	*	Haha that I did. 
t1_dua5idf	1	*	The feeling/illusion of power as well...?
t1_dsb5ud2	1	*	but it has environmental consequences , like those discussed in TFA  perhaps localised generation can reduce the need for new hydro, reducing the impact
t1_ds7qsr2	1	*	News or speculation?

t1_dtasqtt	1	*	Haha I'm cringing right now. I'm always doubtful of magical rags in restaurants that are used to wipe down the table between customers. Some things I would rather just not see
t1_dtagi60	1	*	They harvest oil from sewer pipes, recycling soup is nothing.
t1_dtbcrvx	1	*	Here comes /r/Asianmasculinity  to do damage control.  I don't know why you would defend China this hard. There are plenty of better countries in Asia that don't fit this stuff. 
t1_dtai18q	1	*	I get this reference!
t1_dtapsb5	1	*	Exactly, China is extremely diverse and full of many different perspectives. Many places in China don't even speak the same language!
t1_dtaofjo	0	*	It's not just China.  Under Trump's America more and more corporations are doing things like this because Trump lets them get away with it.
t1_dtajag2	1	*	Out of sight; out of mind. They probably know it happens, but outrage doesn't set in until someone shows proof of it. 
t1_dtac0cg	1	*	Dehumanization of China? Dude people are saying the hate the manners and behaviors of the tourist Chinese, not that they are dogs or anything.  
t1_dtahfvj	1	*	But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
t1_dtask76	1	*	If you can't stop gutter oil issues in China I doubt they can stop these unsanitary practices at least not any time soon. I hope that changes.
t1_dtdx05k	0	*	I have heard that from friends who've been there. I would go if business took me that way, but I don't see myself using a vacation to go there. There are still many other places I'd rather travel.

t1_dse10g6	1	*	Doesn't matter your race, creed, or color.  Older & younger brothers are natural enemies.

t1_dscmxhe	0	*	Racism towards a religion? Explain
t1_dsd272y	1	*	So then it's ok to tear into a new born baby? Feelings about over population don't translate into the abuse of one baby. 
t1_dscfc4v	0	*	Is that a commonly used pitchfork? 
t1_dscswnx	1	*	Brown babies only allowed to be born in the middle east, where we can bomb them before they grow up.
t1_dscq9eh	1	*	Why I should hide something I believe in? Maybe in your country it is normal to conceal your political opinions if they don't suit the mainstream/governments line, I do not have to do it.

t1_dscz31n	1	*	Gateway. You are a poet.
t1_dscfztf	1	*	I treat an entire group of people like shit for what they believe. I call them Nazis.  There is nothing wrong with hating someone for what they believe.
t1_dsc7thu	1	*	White demographic replacement isn't much of a conspiracy
t1_dsdlt0w	0	*	Iran does not. It also has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel.
t1_dscalsv	1	*	Sadly a lot of people don't think that way.
t1_dscuuus	1	*	But in espanol
t1_dsccdf3	1	*	We have different words for different concepts for a reason. It's important that we make these distinctions- don't be that person dude
t1_dsd303o	1	*	As a consequence creating causes for refugees, like meddling in foreign afairs and selling weapons should also be avoided.
t1_dsedfbd	1	*	Huh. Interesting. 
t1_dscuxuh	1	*	but now.....  now they're the president.
t1_dsclha2	1	*	Pols are more aware of the fact that they are peniless and therefore powerless...
t1_dsckyp1	1	*	It actually is the first baby born in Vienna in 2018. The government doesnt choose a random baby.  source: am austrian
t1_dsdlxp0	1	*	I follow various sources. I think you probably follow rebel media or some other low status outlet.
t1_dsc9gxa	1	*	It's almost as if, we're not /those/ types of wankers, we're a totally different type is a suitable line of reasoning 
t1_dscc7dg	0	*	You mean the belief in fairy tales. You're totally smart. Not!
t1_dscn80y	1	*	*looks at my sister*
t1_dsc2rxq	0	*	Maybe privatley, he hasn't made the mistake of admitting it. He is however uncomfortably silent to the white nationalist bullshit coming from his coalition partner.
t1_dscb4f5	1	*	The damage depends in the diet, though.
t1_dsce2nb	1	*	I'm saying these things aren't happening in a vacuum. The history is thick and people have opinions based on it. My levity aside I wasn't condoning harm on an innocent child.
t1_dsc4g9k	1	*	Currently?  I'm not sure we do.  And way to focus on a phone typo, that's not petty at all.
t1_dscoc7f	1	*	Simple. Spend it in Canada. Problem solved.
t1_dscldw3	1	*	Well at least that's a rational position.  
t1_dscbhth	1	*	Merkel isn't communist. She's liberal scum.
t1_dsdelp3	1	*	Islamophobia isn't even a real thing... Phobias are irrational fears. Theres nothing irrational about a fear of Islam...
t1_dscaqiy	1	*	The problem here in Austria is that everybody is talking about immigrants and nazis, while the two parties in power cut social benefits of the lowest classes, while lowering taxes for the rich.
t1_dsbufyv	1	*	Gee, thanks tips. 
t1_dscm6sq	1	*	Yeah I'm not in support of Sharia Law either.  I just want us to stop hating each other. It's unproductive, stupid, and reversing the development of humanity.
t1_dscanog	1	*	No it's Stalin's
t1_dscfii4	0	*	Oh please.  These Austrian trolls are committing very, very low level hate crimes.  Now the sex assaults on New Years Eve and nonstop terror attacks are how you do hate crimes.  
t1_dschokt	0	*	Some politicians have picked up on it.  Unfortunately most of the ones that have are stoking the fires of prejudice in order to personally profit off of it.
t1_dsc7nw5	0	*	Exclude the shithole Middle East and then tell me what is the most opressed religion
t1_dscfzqv	1	*	This is a fact, I concur.
t1_dsce5dx	1	*	whos*
t1_dscbxt0	1	*	You do know Austria and Germany are different places?
t1_dscb4hw	0	*	Holocaust denial for example
t1_dscid7z	0	*	We do though. The President is the guy who basically chairs the Senate. It's not a super important position and I'd have to Google it you remember who it is, but it's a thing. 
t1_dsc5rm7	1	*	Wouldnt be surprised if crash plays a part it people turning twisted like this. 
t1_dsc913l	1	*	Islamophobia is not real because the fear is not irrational. 
t1_dsmv5es	0	*	Not true. We are all one race. 
t1_dscoy71	1	*	>Would dislike happy parents in nazi uniforms holding their newborn as well, especially when the media wants me to cheer them  You would love that, why are you lying?
t1_dsmv0z8	0	*	Oh right, because the place to have intelligent, nuanced conversations is not the internet.
t1_dsc129q	0	*	Not unexpected.  Austria is a small insular country. It's basically a rich Serbia. 
t1_dsd1tfz	1	*	indeed..
t1_dsciim9	1	*	I know a pair of twins, one was born December 31, 1999, and the other was born January 1, 2000. The older never lets the younger forget that theyre a millennia older than them
t1_dsclcav	0	*	Keep saying that please. Liberal idiots like you made our new and awesome government possible ;)
t1_dsc8uz4	1	*	Implying there is any  Bigotry of any kind is irrational 
t1_dsceb1o	1	*	Your're kidding yourself if you think I don't notice you didn't fully comprehend my post. No where do I tout the US better than Europe. Your ignorance aside, all of the West has this problem. 
t1_dscnnve	0	*	Yeah, that isn't really why.

t1_dsc8be7	1	*	Bush still thinks you're Australian
t1_dsccj2p	1	*	I was gonna say that. Is it terrible that I made the same mistake but then wasnt surprised at all...
t1_dsbvifq	0	*	I too feel nationalistic pride in telling a newborn baby to die a early death.
t1_dscbwik	1	*	Legally restricting her from wearing a veil is more oppressive than giving her a choice.  Which side are you on again?
t1_dsc8gme	1	*	>their new 18 year investment.  Ain't nothing new about red states.
t1_dscbezk	1	*	I never joke on the internet. Everything I say here is one hundred percent true and non sarcastic. 
t1_dsccfsg	0	*	No, they don't make that distinction ever. That's the problem. The reason its a problem because any justifiable criticism of Islam gets grouped into the label of racism and Islamophobia as well. 
t1_dsbxhhm	1	*	Hating babies seems like a pretty Nazi thing to me...
t1_dscc1fr	1	*	Oh great, another dumbass media conspiracy.
t1_dscnlsz	0	*	Wow really? Lmao 
t1_dscclys	1	*	No!
t1_dscdagp	1	*	Almost every pupil visits Mauthausen labour camp including a small gas chamber, crematorium and death stairs to the quarry. 
t1_dsc67k0	1	*	The party they are referring to is literally a far right party made by Nazis.
t1_dsdxjdp	0	*	I mean, let's not pretend people don't also hate you out here (or at least used to). 'Jugo' was **the** slur of all slurs when I was in elementary school.
t1_dsck0me	1	*	You're a pathetic dirtbag.
t1_dsckl4h	0	*	Where are you from?
t1_dsbyd73	1	*	so this is preemptive hate on the baby?
t1_dsc9vfk	1	*	Whoever downvoted you is an idiot. You are correct. Words change. But trying to explain that to people is often the same as trying to show them how racism is still well and alive.
t1_dumga0v	1	*	Never said we would. Just a general statement 
t1_duezskh	0	*	And they literally pay you to use it. 
t1_dt8rzjf	0	*	Not sell the Turks damn Leopard tanks, for a start.
t1_dt98u3x	0	*	But as a Turk you have to admit that the word terrorist gets tossed around quite liberally there, right? Watching Turkish news reports reminds me of America during the post-9/11 Bush years.
t1_dt8lv88	1	*	I believe so.
t1_dufer2g	1	*	You can't always leave your seat on a plane.  You can't always get into the toilet on a plane.

t1_dukpczj	0	*	Nah just with his dictatorship
t1_dukggti	1	*	Like a shower...
t1_duketzv	1	*	Probably because there is zero irony in a charity trying to fix the fuck ups of politicians in the pockets of 'private industry'.
t1_duk5e5r	1	*	Check out Trees For Life, they are  working (slowly but surely)  to restore the Caledonian Forest in Scotland. 
t1_duk9fef	1	*	More like, See? Someone planted a tree. That's will cancel out the 15 trillion pounds of CO2 produced.
t1_duksvj0	0	*	That's like saying the world's population is at a better level because of Hitler...  Doesn't work
t1_dukipk3	1	*	This isn't a Trump initiative, it's a plan to offset Trump-caused environmental damage.
t1_dukfxy6	1	*	America First, whether you're with him or against him.
t1_dukficf	1	*	Yeah, I feel like the thought process was if we put his name on it, maybe he won't fucking napalm it just to piss off his 'enemies'.
t1_dukaskk	1	*	but practices cronynism.
t1_duk8pxc	1	*	Yeah if we want to name anything to spite Trump just name it after Obama!
t1_duk4d1q	1	*	Idiots are the ones naming it that way.
t1_duklmub	1	*	Trump: I **AM** the stupid!
t1_dukckw8	1	*	Hyuge trees!
t1_dukiy4s	1	*	Or they're setting him up to make a fool of himself. Um, Mr. President it's named that way because it plans to offset the damage your policies are doing. Daily meltdown ensues.
t1_dukcvrl	1	*	Bigotree
t1_dukb4tr	1	*	you assume they catch on at all
t1_dsloc4y	1	*	If the next Republican potus acts like a decent human being, more power to him/her.

t1_dtgsm8w	1	*	Hunting.
t1_dtgrfbu	0	*	Big game hunter is a synonym for chubby chaser in my mind. 
t1_dtgtmkv	1	*	These Lions are raised for hunting.  they are not out of the wild.  That makes hunting them a lame sport, but it does not further threaten the species.   
t1_dtgrx87	0	*	Jesus whiteknight read the comments asked and answered this was a place solely for breeding to hunt for profit. Not for sanctuaries not for government protection. Bred to be killed for profit 
t1_dtgra6r	1	*	and society is out of touch with reality in exactly the way you think, I bet.

t1_dtgrc9e	1	*	As a hunter who has been asked to attend some of these here in the US, I refuse... there's no sport in it... its akin to the t Rex/goat scene in Jurassic park
t1_dtgssvd	1	*	Especially with the fact that there are more groos than Australian people... They're like deers in the US. 
t1_dtgrpfq	0	*	But you can donate money to their conservation without actually going there to kill an animal. Its not as though the killing part is necessary.
t1_dtgtnjz	1	*	RIP BGH.
t1_dtgsjnn	1	*	It's so true. I'm so far removed from my food that I would become a vegetarian if I had to even see my meat being killed, let alone do it myself.   Unfortunately, I like it the way it is lol
t1_dtgsf6w	1	*	Fucking campers
t1_dsx390x	0	*	Ocean bugs are also bigger so you can actually pull out the flesh instead of having to eat the whole thing, shells and organs and bowel contents included.
t1_dt3yf0h	0	*	You had better charge you're phone, now. 
t1_dt3y600	1	*	also it makes your house more stable as the tsunami has to break the additional moment of inertia
t1_dt3yfhq	1	*	So if you're going to drown, you can at least do it in comfort. 
t1_dt3yepu	1	*	Stay safe, dude.
t1_dt3xuvy	1	*	Brb flying to Hawaii.
t1_dt3z1uk	1	*	It was supposed to hit Kodiak an hour and a half ago. Nothing yet, but reports of receding water in the harbor so everyone is still on edge. 
t1_dt3wxi5	1	*	If your drinking doesn't trigger tsunami alerts you need to drink more.
t1_dt3xlph	0	*	is it that feeling of being on a boat on the ocean rather than intense shifting?
t1_dt3x21e	1	*	Do you think this is funny? 
t1_dt3x1gs	1	*	La Palma, yeah, that's out there like Yellowstone, just waiting.
t1_dt3xu1k	1	*	No alerts yet. 
t1_dt3xupc	1	*	If everyone fills their bathtubs with water there is less water for the tsunami
t1_dt3z5k2	1	*	Thats exactly what NOAA websites said when Alaskans tried to find out if they were safe. Because, ya know, Republicans shut the government down ... again. 
t1_dt3yujk	1	*	Note you're a loser who should do the world a favor and DIAF
t1_dt3yn1z	0	*	Are they just as common as they are in California?

t1_dt3xs3e	1	*	Same reason you do for hurricanes. Fresh water supply after you lose services due to damage or contamination.
t1_dt3z8u8	1	*	Literally the same system that had been used to send a false alarm in Hawaii. Such an archaic system. But very useful
t1_dt3w9qy	1	*	General Tsunami...
t1_dt3yzhg	1	*	Yes he is. Fear mongering is now what is needed now.  The Pacific rim is always on fire. It just usually doesnt affect this many people 
t1_dt9vwpm	1	*	Well in a lot of Christian nations, if somebody touches or looks at what is under a woman's shirt, people get arrested. If someone touches a mans chest, nobody gets arrested. Fancy that eh
t1_du66ci6	1	*	He's more of the same from Fine Gael, but I have never thought of his orientation or his heritage. I don't care about stupid shit like that.

t1_dtbcidv	1	*	Yeah, you come and do that mate
t1_duwww5n	0	*	>ban all cars from major cities  That's... a bit too extreme. A ban on all non-electric vehicles is the absolute most that the general public would accept.

t1_dupgqsu	0	*	Which depts? 
t1_dupys8j	1	*	Is it already 2024?
t1_dupergn	1	*	Recommended, not mandated. We have a plan to increase to that amount over the next few years.
t1_dupftxk	1	*	I suspect they meant socialization. In their example, people have claimed socialized medicine would collapse a country that provided it.
t1_dupgiet	0	*	less reliable US? 
t1_duphp40	0	*	I have. Beautiful country, great infrastructure. Takes care of the sick and needy and does it with fiscal responsibility.  Why's your country so great?

t1_dupfaw1	0	*	Well it's not like Russia can *increase* their military spending at this point.
t1_dupide2	0	*	The closest to that is when we put all the Japanese in camps. I don't see camps, all i see is deportations
t1_dupkltq	0	*	i lived in Germany too, i think taking nearly half of someones income making only 50k euros a year is insane.  Germany WAS a wonderful place
t1_duq9mma	0	*	Probably stay the same.  No one wants to invade Europe. 
t1_duq789p	1	*	Venezuela is a failing shit hole because it has an uneducated elementary school teacher as its leader who doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
t1_duphwcd	1	*	Sorry... I could not help it. I received so many angry comments, had to rub it in again.
t1_dupo96h	1	*	Last president who ran the country in a fiscally responsible manner was Clinton.  By the end of his term we were seriously considering what would happen if the USG had no debt.
t1_dupqszd	1	*	You're saying that from the outside looking in, but a surplus means, that the money wasn't actually invested in any of those things you are listing
t1_dupitrt	0	*	I remember this exact comment situation the last time a Germany annual budget thread a few years back
t1_duq0ymj	1	*	Invasion to settle that score

t1_dupi87g	1	*	Well fixing our debt even a little requires spending less AND raising taxes. Neither side wants to do both.
t1_duq3asp	1	*	> Objectively      > From German perspective      Find the mismatch.   
t1_dupfi3a	1	*	That's only the ignorant side of the country which is sadly, the majority. Some of us, if given the opportunity, would gladly leave this place.  But it's not because I want to... :(
t1_dupjpw4	1	*	Paltry military spending...

t1_dupeh7p	0	*	No if you want moronish look into a mirror.
t1_dupm3j0	0	*	France, the UK, Finland all manage to have functional militaries. There's nothing to be proud of about our military not even being capable of defending our country.
t1_duqi19c	0	*	When was the last time Germany was bailed out by the US? Dresden maybe? Or when the US funded the Taliban and sent them on their merry way?

t1_duq5qu4	0	*	So how do I say that number?
t1_dupl5gq	1	*	Germans do that everyday AND yield a surplus on GDP!!!11!
t1_dupkd3e	0	*	If doing nothing results in a 50 billion surplus I guess everybody should do nothing, seems to be an easy way to wealth. I don't think you know what you're talking about. No offense.
t1_dupj23v	1	*	Aaaaaaaaaannnnnnd its gone.
t1_dupj237	1	*	Well when you put it that way! Doing the math I can buy a gun in about 3 years from the tax cut savings! No bullets though....
t1_dupq0aw	1	*	Sounds like it's time for a revolution
t1_dupjag0	0	*	Who is America protecting them from?
t1_dupojt0	1	*	#PAY DENBTS
t1_duppaie	1	*	Germany forced a number of other countries into austerity, so it clearly likes austerity quite well 
t1_dupc7d9	0	*	The US is a world leader is new tech and medical development. I would not say the US best minds are making better weapons.
t1_duql3bp	1	*	Nobody asked America to pick up the tab...
t1_dupkbom	1	*	The man in the high castle is pretty good, though!  Edit: changed he to The
t1_dupi09k	1	*	Hey I do that just in America! I love my country, but man would I love to be in a place that loves soccer. I am the only one of my friends that actively watches and plays. 
t1_dupphzl	1	*	So great! Infrastructure is an F, Healthcare system is a joke and you haven't had a pay vacation in how long?? You're missing out on life buddy. 
t1_dura4nj	1	*	Israel is not a representation of all Jews. If you have a problem with Israel you aren't an anti-semite.

t1_dupo48c	1	*	...Do you know?
t1_dupkk56	0	*	Or an army. Maybe they really do have a hidden nazi base on the Moon.
t1_dupipe9	1	*	Debt is ok so long as you can pay it back. We are not paying it back. It's no longer ok
t1_dupqryq	0	*	Yeah...that's a total myth. I've lived in Germany, waiting times aren't bad.  The German healthcare system is LEEEEEEAGUES above that in the US. 
t1_dupqwjq	1	*	Thanks for this answer, genuinely very insightful.
t1_dupn95x	1	*	How is that a good thing? Universities should be in charge of R&D. Without an interest in creating the next big thing in mass destruction...
t1_dupjm1j	1	*	To be fair, France sells nuclear energy to Germany, and Germany sells coal energy to France.
t1_dupjngb	1	*	That was not directed to everyone having a different opinion! That was meant for those people sending death threats and the like... you, too! :)
t1_durqbv3	1	*	Math works differently over there because of gravity in the Atlantic Ocean. 
t1_dupfsw2	1	*	I'm not and I don't think any of my friends are, atleast those that would care.

t1_dupiytk	0	*	Germany is just smaller, so I don't think you get it at all. And I am not so sure living in America has just as many benefits. You must be from Mississippi.
t1_duqaerw	1	*	it would cost to much. 
t1_duph8q8	0	*	Dont forget ignorance and hate.  Exports of those are going gang busters. :p
t1_dupgoa2	1	*	You've also done amazing.

t1_duq4wx6	0	*	Actually the American economy is still booming...
t1_dupt9g6	1	*	Why rely on US Conservatives to cut the deficit. Why can't the Democrats do it if it is such an important thing?
t1_duq3nnf	1	*	relax man, it's /r/berlin for once :)
t1_dupgnwm	1	*	Germans would rather not discuss trains for obvious reasons
t1_duql9wl	1	*	I like that! Maybe not the fucking assholes part but there is no judging here (unless you work for the military... I dont get why nobody saw this for the poor attempt at trolling it was).
t1_duph3mu	1	*	Well according to Nancy Pelosi theres nothing left to cut.

t1_duppmq3	1	*	yep, wages are quite low, also compared to the us, especially skilled professionals. 
t1_duprt8b	1	*	The Luftwaffe is in the same shape. More Eurofighter Typhoons stuck on the ground than flyable.
t1_duphcaf	1	*	Yep, and we are proud of that. We know what it means to be a refugee.
t1_dupgfe9	1	*	Reading your statement gives me a sense of you probably knowing what you are talking about. Cheers!  Edit: Cool, you found most of your errors! Good for you!
t1_dupluuh	0	*	Your point is a lot more impactful without acting like an idiot right at the end. It was fine on its own.

t1_dupxhsg	0	*	Cite sources for that?
t1_dupgxax	1	*	That is insane.
t1_dupyoc3	0	*	For how long tho? The US had its own genecide and that doesnt seem to eliminate them? 
t1_dupilre	1	*	So they have even bigger surplus next year? Sounds smart.
t1_dupiej5	0	*	> that you will pay 2% of your gross domestic product  Yes, pay 2% in 2024 how it was signed. It is still 2018. Takes a while until the 2% have to be met.
t1_dupn72u	0	*	No, not at all. I said Republicans *could be* like her party, if they excised their radical extremists, like the Randians or advocates for ethnostates. 
t1_dupgazn	0	*	> Our schools look horrible in contrast to American ones  lower body count though..
t1_duq0oss	1	*	I don't know how people can stand taking their work home like this (if they don't own the business). I wouldn't be able to relax if I was expected to constantly be reachable while not at work.

t1_dt6n75c	1	*	To be fair, the Pope's article was probably not written in English, and the translator seems to have put this particular spin on it.
t1_dt6eemj	1	*	Username DEFINITELY checks out. 
t1_dt6gmsi	1	*	Yeah, I mean, National Enquirer has existed forever, but when I was a kid at least it cost 50 cents.    Sharing a Brietbart article on Facebook is free. It's a different game.

t1_dt6n1tn	1	*	> Pope Francis represented a big change in Roman Catholicism  Just a few days ago he blamed abuse victims. The guy is an asshole and member of the Catholic church don't deserve any respect.

t1_dt6t6nw	0	*	> Fake news is used to convince you there is no right side of history   The rejection of meta-narratives is a part of post-modernism. It has little to do with fake news lol
t1_duivi47	0	*	And yet, she left. 
t1_dul4szr	1	*	Im so sorry
t1_dsvf1se	0	*	This is what gets me. Regardless of economics, shouldnt we treat our neighbors with respect?
t1_due4tew	1	*	So, not racism?
t1_dugtcua	0	*	Absolutely not treason. Treason in the USA involves aiding a country thst they are at war with. They are not at war with his Twitter account
t1_dugwpdi	1	*	How is it that you have just two main parties, and one of them sucks so much ass? 
t1_dugprgr	1	*	Believe me, I'm aware.
t1_duj5wtq	1	*	Me ? lol no Im not.. are you high ?
t1_duh8t2t	1	*	Big if true.
t1_dugye87	0	*	oh lets attack grammar and post history instead of providing an actual argument. Nice work reddit detective, heres ya [medal](https://imgur.com/gallery/sy9lVl4)
t1_duh3jwr	1	*	To be honest I don't see anything wrong with that, it makes sense that the President gets to decide if he's giving an official statement or not.
t1_dugpzq5	0	*	He has tons of people blocked though
t1_dugsj9r	1	*	We have a president that is terrified to actually be held to his work because he would for sure commit perjury. 
t1_duh0vqv	1	*	Can confirm. Trump's bigoted statements have been used against his administration by federal judges in immigration policy cases.
t1_dugqcis	0	*	Most people I know voted for Trump because they believed Hillary to be Satan incarnate. This was their finger to the Democrats.
t1_dugqz7t	1	*	It has bipartisan support. It is more of a response to how he undermines the official White House stances with his tweets. 
t1_duh035h	1	*	The explanation I've heard from most Trump voters I know seems to be both:      Fuck you, this is who I want
t1_dugtdp4	1	*	Hey a lot of us (actually the majority if you're going by votes) never asked for this shit
t1_dugtfiv	1	*	American here. Same
t1_dugw438	1	*	Corrupt politicians, bankers, and multinational corporations?

t1_dugujcp	1	*	scary
t1_dugqb3e	0	*	500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR would be more appropriate. 
t1_dugr2tl	1	*	If the internet has taught me anything it's that changing the US flag would cause your country to implode.
t1_dugsdjl	1	*	3 million that we know of. Don't forget about all the people whose votes weren't counted due to Russian interference.
t1_dugvhql	1	*	If you smell dog shit everywhere you go, check your shoe
t1_dugq941	1	*	Yeah the fact that it was *only* 3 million isn't something to fucking brag about 
t1_dugua7j	0	*	No they didn't, go ahead and look for that actual quote in the story. WaPo made it up cause that's what they do
t1_dugsyzj	1	*	It was a wouldn't it be funny if... 
t1_duhhur5	1	*	That's really not as strong a defence as you think it is.   He should have lost horribly. A close race is just as telling as a won one. 
t1_dugpom4	1	*	Depends on who you ask. It was probably a lot of both.
t1_dugs70u	1	*	Pence isn't a threat to our National Security like Trump is. I get that people don't like his views on various domestic policies, but he wouldn't be the same kind of threat that Trump legitimately is.
t1_dugp9ro	0	*	Not the elite but the Electoral College.
t1_dugz955	1	*	It's really both. 
t1_dugsbrw	1	*	You clearly have never driven around in North Carolina...
t1_dugvc6g	1	*	It's my understanding that a Conservative will eat a pile of shit if there's a chance their breath will offend a Liberal.
t1_dugsbq8	1	*	I like how the Swiss do it with a council of 7 people. Make them directly elected and I'm down.
t1_dugv3d6	1	*	Because delusional supporters retweet and like everything?
t1_dugw3z8	1	*	Yeah that ain't happening for a lot of them
t1_dugrrzz	1	*	No, it is a fact that all his tweets are official statements. There is absolutely no ambiguity. 
t1_dugrtio	1	*	sounds pretty close to the truth
t1_duguxsm	0	*	[Citation Needed]
t1_dugv98d	1	*	Good point
t1_dugslez	1	*	Werent they saying you were supposed to take them seriously and literally unless of course they weren't serious or literal. 
t1_dugys14	1	*	 just like the president of Iran!
t1_dugx989	0	*	There's some of both. I know someone who boycotted the Superbowl because of disrespect to the flag. There's just some people who 100% buy into the spin.
t1_duhmhqw	1	*	From what I understand, that was the mindset of a non-insignificant portion of his voter base.
t1_duh6f0p	1	*	I thought it was more of a Hold my beer, watch this. 
t1_dugs656	1	*	Exactly what people wanted and think or thought they have.
t1_duh17d0	1	*	It depends on what the definition of the word is....is.
t1_duhk3i4	1	*	>I didn't vote for the guy. None of my pals voted for the guy.  hmm I think at least a few of these people might be too embarrassed or ashamed to admit it. 
t1_dugtdsm	1	*	2 cents per post? just a few more days champ and you might move out of the basement
t1_dugs22c	1	*	Im pretty sure, given enough time, they all make him look bad.  
t1_duh91gv	1	*	That was the consensus at the time of the election.
t1_dugqgyl	0	*	Funny, yet he's still the president of the USA, your system really works. LOL
t1_dugy20y	1	*	Hardest worker in the White House. His employees unanimously agree
t1_dugwc3f	0	*	I never found the qoute or any general reference to his tweeting in that article. Did you?
t1_dugrvk3	0	*	Why would that have to be clarified? That's obvious.
t1_duhtpaa	1	*	Have patience. I'm sure he'll outgrow his youthful immaturity and start acting presidential any day now.
t1_dugswbq	1	*	Russia stated they consider Trump's tweets official statements of the US Government.
t1_dugxb0r	1	*	*How many assholes we got on this ship anyway!?*
t1_dugxnje	1	*	No, they live in the mountains of the Antarctic.
t1_dugq92t	1	*	You have a system in place where that doesn't matter.
t1_ds882ou	1	*	Uh oh someone is projecting. 
t1_ds8e2ml	0	*	I'm referring to the Trump tweets where he casually goads Kim Jong Un into nuclear war, we could do without that.
t1_dtj7gz2	0	*	I mean the one who took the pictures. It's a violation of privacy according to the Spanish Criminal Code

t1_dscendb	0	*	I just inject strange substances, any drug works through a needle 
t1_dty0w2s	0	*	What crime? Illegally wiretapped by obama? The democrats trying to interfere with the election by trying to get something on Trump from the wiretap?  
t1_dty4nwp	1	*	Yeah l saw that also, almost like they are just pulling shit from their asses to see which bits stick. 
t1_du2d9ls	0	*	What You need to know about the uk is: it's clapped

t1_dsaaiit	1	*	With the exception that these people are stealing. 
t1_dslaqdy	1	*	How 'bout changing that '4' to a '2'?  Isn't it so nice they all keep giving 25 year boggies to 5 year realities?  Hell, Hawkings is telling them to move to Venus but they just can't get past Mars.

t1_dsinj1r	0	*	Theres no need for racism sir
t1_dtmewlf	0	*	maybe people are ignoring it because it's party rhetoric that glosses over the fact that the growth curve has already peaked and is not continuing.
t1_dtoa2ll	1	*	I am not a fan of cashless systems and will always want the cash option.
t1_dtld7c9	1	*	Just because the navy isn't installing them on ships doesn't mean R&D has halted, just  that large scale implantation isn't around the corner.  
t1_dtleugv	0	*	That isn't non-deadly!!  RIP Maude Flanders
t1_dtlekye	0	*	that makes more sense. I'd like to keep an eye on any news of testing then.
t1_dtl9fzc	1	*	They are  indeed much more accurate because they fire 'smart munitions'  which are essentially gps-guided artillery shells.
t1_dtllwhq	1	*	> While the US Navy has railguns that work, they haven't been installed on any vessels that we know of.  FTFY
t1_dtm02n1	0	*	NFC payments were around for awhile, it's called Android Pay. Electric cars? Plenty? High speed trains? Is that something new?

t1_dung0ws	0	*	I agree, humans will never get their shit together but as we have seen the internet become a tool of repression by autocratic states, so will this technology further said oppression.

t1_dtvahnc	1	*	How big of a rectum did they build into this drone?
t1_dubrko7	1	*	Thailand is pretty similar. Pizzahut split into Pizza Company. Est was made as soon as Pepsi's contract expired, etc. It's more complicated than that, but essentially the end result is the same.

t1_dudho7a	1	*	In America, it's not a problem that two of the four major telecom providers are foreign owned. In China, *all* the major telecom providers are not just not foreign-owned, they're owned by the *state*.
