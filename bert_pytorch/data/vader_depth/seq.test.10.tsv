t1_dv1wkfy	-0.837900	*	Canadian here. What has he done recently ? I've heard nothing but good things about him aside from some crap about India. 
t1_dueorth	0.857500	*	Tofu has even higher amounts of protein, why would they use soymilk instead of tofu if it's all about nutrition?
t1_due7rs3	-0.296000	*	If you are an American citizen then Trump is your president. Stop being a child just because an election didnt go your way
t1_durba8m	-0.599400	*	Drone strikes kill civilians regularly. From their point of view, we are the terrorists.
t1_dun1jtc	0.000000	*	What did they say before?
t1_duhwy34	0.128000	*	Which...sounds like it's got a certain charm about it. Maybe not a bad lifestyle...
t1_dus1sd5	0.000000	*	You think the FISA judge wouldnt be filing a complaint if they were lied too? I they would speak out about being lied to, especially to the Trump administration. 
t1_duu53x2	0.612400	*	China has never controlled Taiwan. Never has anyone in Taiwan gotten a Chinese passport just for being a Taiwanese citizen. Shit, you can't even get free shipping from taobao if you're in Taiwan.
t1_dv0oj9c	-0.402300	*	> Posting ISIS propaganda videos showing people run over by tanks and burnt alive is a free speech issue now?  Uh, yeah. How is this even a question? Of course it's a free speech issue.

t1_dud608b	0.516000	*	We have not had a cyber pearl harbor yet. Something like that would be the remote detonation of the majority of American nuclear bombs, or the total distruction of our power grid.
t1_dugs5wf	0.000000	*	So you've only seen moronic Americans frequently use reddit?
t1_dujvtw3	0.000000	*	A connection is one thing. Moving from A and B share a common donor to A is funded and run by B is something else.
t1_dv378xd	-0.585900	*	If that opinion is bullshit, yeah, sure.  Not all opinions are created equal.  Would it be unfair for a flat Earther to be downvoted in r/science?

t1_dv1x9jx	-0.077200	*	It is clearly a tongue in cheek joke in the video. The whole video, not the clipped version that made the Facebook rounds.
t1_duwcc7u	0.663300	*	are you ok?
t1_duplnf1	0.401900	*	It's mostly to lower the interest rates to try and bolster the economy, inflation is an after effect that is beneficial up to a certain point. Really depends on the central bank's goal. 
t1_dupqi7y	-0.202300	*	Like I said, it's inevitable. Those 100 million people are going to be 200 million now or later now matter what we do. Better to be prepared for the next downturn.
t1_dv2nu6d	-0.949300	*	Yeah, well, from outside of the USA, the urban metropolises dominating the vote seems like a damn fine idea, given the result of listening to the rural vote.
t1_dut3v7g	-0.592700	*	When people assume that they can't change anything, that is when we lose power and we let dictators take over 
t1_ducuygx	0.401900	*	You mean like during the campaign?  Wow holy shit sharp insight you've got there.
t1_dv37ze6	0.975700	*	Her campaign was horse shit. I voted for her because of how awful Donald was. But Hillary and the Democratic party helped Donald win.

t1_durencb	-0.784500	*	> It's deeply disturbing and cultish to look at from the outside  I'm sure it is. Especially when you have no idea what you're talking about.

t1_dukh3sa	0.840200	*	India and China stayed in the agreement. I agree: if anyone has the power to fight climate change, it's them. The US being in or out does not affect their capability to fix their internal pollution.

t1_dud45ih	0.000000	*	Who said I was offended?
t1_duza3z8	0.868300	*	That's not why the Crimea was annexed. Putin needed to keep the naval base that Ukraine might have decided against letting Russia use if they were to join NATO.
t1_dupkbv0	0.000000	*	But in a Monty Python universe it may be required to *cross* a street.
t1_dv0tm3a	-0.716300	*	You're more or less right. There's a little nuance to this (we don't have absolute freedom of speech), but your basic concept is the right answer to questioning how that subreddit exists.
t1_dugdtlf	0.421500	*	Yes, when those subjects are broached is speak up as well.  Th his is about Israel though, and their long history of bull shit and the contemporary evidence that behavior is still a thing.

t1_dv00v42	-0.170000	*	Actually it is. Every time a socialist/communist country fails far left wingers come out and claim that it wasn't socialism that failed because it wasn't real (or true) socialism. 
t1_dugeo4f	0.695600	*	How else are you supposed to make decisions? Foresight is important.

t1_dugjsjf	-0.177900	*	I agree, Israel is about 95% white if you do not count the occupied zones which are basically concentration camps. Israel lacks diversity, it shouldn't be such a racist country in this day and age. 
t1_dulqx5y	0.458800	*	Sign me up!
t1_duss7bf	0.401900	*	I need to play this again. I have the Special Edition and its a lot of fun to play with mods. Problem is its such a timesink; I can easily put another 400-500 hours into it without even trying.
t1_dv0f2ud	0.401900	*	How does that refute what I said? There is a difference but a country can be both a democracy and a republic at the same time.
t1_duibonn	0.449700	*	Yeah but she doesn't know that and he's hell-bent on coming across as a lowly exchange student, not a heir apparent.

t1_dv18uyj	-0.951400	*	So, when confronted with the accusation that you are just like ISIS, you can't highlight the differences between you and ISIS, because that would be supporting ISIS?  That's absurd.

t1_dum0jnc	0.000000	*	Oh shit, your political science analysis is on par with third graders. Sorry, should have assumed the worst.
t1_duh5oqj	0.567300	*	For what crimes, exactly, do you imagine this will be happening?  Also we don't have public executions in the US. So good luck with your bloodthirsty fantasy.

t1_dug5d88	0.421500	*	The person's not saying that older people *never* text and drive. Just that it's much, much more common in younger drives than older drivers.

t1_duv1o5p	-0.585900	*	> 1968  Think this is the case still? Or that the more likely answer is that Jeff  Sessions ties to the private prison lobby is a bigger motivator? 
t1_dv1kjty	0.000000	*	Jesus. A metacanadian that's also in love with Trump.  
t1_dusi662	0.585900	*	I think you'll find that a large swath of the United States indeed does very strongly think that a border wall between the US and Mexico will have a legitimate benefit to the American people.
t1_dv44i53	0.000000	*	He just said that we should be considering policies that help out minorities that are stuck growing up in unfortunate environments. Certainly you agree that these kinds of policies are needed?

t1_dujwwvo	0.859100	*	Why so abrasive? I saw nothing in your comments referencing the association between CO2 and temperature. Regardless, it would have been easy to respond with a yes or no.
t1_dugrnwh	0.000000	*	That's why there are states. The bottom line is that your vote matters more/less depending on where you live. That's not a democracy.

t1_duzzkln	-0.636000	*	Isnt Elon Musk South-African? Imagine losing someone like him to stupid shit like this.
t1_duv0mt5	-0.177900	*	Actually I just said you *didn't* lie about them - somehow you managed to omit any mention of them, instead claiming several years of study.  Are you capable of posting in good faith at all?
t1_dv0nbmx	0.381800	*	Oh, she posted child porn? Is that what you're saying?  Are you too obtuse or too unwilling to make an argument on the actual subject?
t1_dulr4mf	0.648600	*	Intentions matter. 
t1_dun1rcz	0.296000	*	...you didn't answer my question. 
t1_ductwqi	0.440400	*	Have you tried Coke Zero? Slightly different taste to Diet Coke. Much less plasticy IMO and tastes much better.
t1_duowamm	0.440400	*	She's still supposed to be Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc wasn't black.
t1_dv29986	0.950700	*	> enhancing business transparency which is why MNCs love the fuck out of Singapore.  Does MNC mean multinational companies? Wouldn't they be against such measures?  
t1_dubmyvo	-0.051100	*	Lmao. Never heard of /r/all huh? Where 90% of the good material is?
t1_duk1iev	-0.909200	*	Stop making excuses for Putin and Russia fucking with our country then. Fuck Donald trump and fuck Vladimir Putin. 
t1_duln607	0.797500	*	Oh look, a real circle jerk in the wild! 
t1_dv36jf0	-0.401900	*	Sanctions, they're pretty obvious that's why I didn't bother pointing them out to begin with.

t1_durzaca	-0.345300	*	I think you're spot on with that interpretation. Did you learn *classical* Arabic too?  I thought that's what most non-natives would have studied first or mainly.
t1_dut1qw1	0.709600	*	Let's be honest, Sun Yat-Sen is overrated in history. The only thing he done right is orchestrated the XinHai Revolution. Other than that, he's pretty much a no one.
t1_duic9sk	0.633200	*	Cool. Like I said, I could give less of a shit about efficiency. I like my computer, but I'll gladly have had them never be invented if it means bill gates didn't fuck over his workers to get it done.
t1_dum1dd7	0.273200	*	OMG, please put your tin foil hat back on. 
t1_dueivlf	-0.170800	*	This is beautiful. Just gave me the fuzzies a little bit. Thank you for refreshing my perspective today :D
t1_duu8it2	0.000000	*	> you think China's official stance is they can fish in any water they want?  That's what the comment you replied to was addressing.
t1_duxshad	0.000000	*	You do realize it was a typo, right? It's a pretty common one, the f and d keys are right next to each other.

t1_duj3qu8	0.000000	*	TAKE A SEAT
t1_due5e5q	-0.557400	*	Well, they say freedom isn't free. Then I open my hospital bill to see they charged me $3000 for morphine (that wasn't even used) and I'm thinking, Yep.
t1_duux756	0.000000	*	I remember reading it's a stealth long range strike bomber.
t1_dud7670	0.369100	*	How am I hypocritical? I have no issue saying there is corruption on both sides. Everyone else is busy arguing over nothing for their own political benefit. 
t1_duhuqos	0.401900	*	You're assuming that it's a market item in the first place... Something that everyone ever will absolutely require *or else they die* does not function according to market forces.
t1_dujppc7	-0.599400	*	I'm all for the USA spending almost a trillion of their own dollars in order to maintain western dominance.
t1_dua4hs1	0.000000	*	That's not what I said. You said anyone who didn't have the right to vote has an unimportant opinion, I'm saying that's a ridiculous thing to suggest.
t1_durxo5k	0.000000	*	You can dummy, Americans are immigrants 
t1_duzmnij	0.000000	*	China is Rimworld?

t1_duymfr4	0.420100	*	Someone born blind I would think.
t1_duu419k	0.226300	*	They're far from the only Muslim group fighting against people like Daesh, though. There are and have been lots of them.
t1_dv3aw7i	0.393500	*	Good way to stop brigading but how tedious is it to ban hundreds of thousands of subscribers? Seems unfeasible.
t1_dujopw6	0.475400	*	Funny. You lot didn't trust these same Intel agencies when it came to WMDs and Saddam.
t1_duza3z8	0.648600	*	That's not why the Crimea was annexed. Putin needed to keep the naval base that Ukraine might have decided against letting Russia use if they were to join NATO.
t1_dut16um	0.472800	*	Nope, it still has yet to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, so its partially in effect until then. It hasnt been ruled legal by a single judge yet.
t1_dudq4ij	0.354300	*	Clinton was a former POTUS. No shit people want to hear him speak. You are so stupid. Making silly innuendos to muddy the waters. 
t1_dugtyjy	0.224700	*	Post graduate degree, six figure income, managed not to vote for Trump... nothing special, really.  I was the lead in my high school musical?
t1_dubkvvc	0.668100	*	The influence to tell them to be honest, take care of themselves, be tolerant and practice meditation.   not a cult. Misusing labels dilute their meaning 
t1_dushz1x	-0.670500	*	I think I killed that guy. I kill a lot of people, but I'm with the guild so you know how it is.
t1_dudxi87	0.318200	*	How much would it suck to be the guy who has to drain and clean those tubs between sets of old people?
t1_duegf8x	0.431900	*	There's reason to believe that russia stated laying the groundwork for their operation years ago, so that's likely what you're seeing.
t1_dv02er0	0.000000	*	And.... he's saying that it's not direct, if it went through Mohammed and then onto paper.  And if man is fallible, so are the writings of man.
t1_duepzk0	-0.384300	*	But why? I am not curious, I know this to be an established fact.  If other people were so interested, use the better resources available to you rather than u/Wuzupmyhomiz, thanks. 
t1_dudvgqc	-0.401900	*	I mean...it works, but now I'm stuck with an Aztec.  You-... you wanna buy an Aztec?
t1_dumr4c5	0.000000	*	Relevant username
t1_dv29v25	-0.648600	*	I think this is it.  Faced with the russian scandal he needs a diversion. Needs to look 'presidented'.  Needs to look like he's actually doing something.   It's a PR stunt. 
t1_dv165yp	0.705000	*	Sources on confiscations?  Also yeah, calling people dumb fucks and hoping they don't breed is very, very smart, polite and democratic. 
t1_dufvg4z	0.731900	*	We don't give a fuck about your cheap chicken. We want good chicken. We don't want to join you at the 30th place in life expectancy.

t1_duernz6	-0.769600	*	Just to add this last bit, it's not about getting rid of social security. It's that he said he wasn't going to, and then he did. He lied and didnt even try to hide it
t1_duhppvf	0.743000	*	But why isn't it? Why wouldn't a nation as a whole want to keep their population healthy? Besides, it's not as if its going unpaid for, that's what taxes are for.   
t1_dufdqv9	0.000000	*	So the people on /r/politics are computer literate but the people on /r/the_donald are not?   Are you aware that your attitude is the problem?
t1_durzl1w	0.755000	*	Not so convincing. Posting the same Shit over and over, lumping everyone anti Assad as ISIS. Russian misinformation
t1_dusjrvy	-0.273200	*	Feel free to go through my comments.   I'm getting bored. 
t1_dv5xyhc	0.647600	*	And by now there are enough tulips there to qualify for annexation by the Dutch
t1_duq6qga	0.000000	*	And yet some states let you fucking pack in a bar.  It's like driving a car.  I'd prefer you be sober, but if I had to pick one, I'd rather y be stoned than drunk.
t1_dulsbis	0.968800	*	Not a fan of the whole higher power thing... 
t1_duihysf	0.938300	*	I never said there wasn't, I said there has been 3 moves to statehood. But the last one would have removed most settlements
t1_dupmpz0	-0.205700	*	Well, more like the military. Yes, there was the border police (Grenzpolizei), but they were more of a military organisation and later part of the NVA.
t1_dud4o4n	0.571900	*	Lololol you the_dotards are running around REEEEEEing like fucking rats, it's so fucking wonderful to see ;)
t1_duoz4zx	0.177900	*	I DID NOT FUCK UP PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN ALIVE ANYMORE FUCKED UP. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. WHAT DO YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND.

t1_dud7vib	-0.670500	*	Ivanka wrote a book?
t1_dv0io3q	-0.757400	*	They would still hate them if their health insurance was swapped for cheaper tax for universal healthcare.
t1_dv19r1n	0.470300	*	Well here in Czechia, gays can adopt a child and we have legal medical marijuana.  I am not that knowledgeable about right in other countries, but we are not living in some kind of totalities.  
t1_dv35moj	-0.102700	*	The difference is you see the odd comment with these sentiments in r/politics, on the Donald there are literally posts with thousands of up votes and comments doing it.
t1_durl835	0.025300	*	Well good.  I don't think he should have apologized.  It was a military decision to end the war.
t1_dv0m9i3	-0.837600	*	It basically did. The big majority of Austria was for the Anschluss.
t1_duj6db2	-0.778300	*	Which opposition leader was that? 
t1_duyk1be	0.809200	*	Europe has plenty of examples where the government got out of control and did some pretty horrendous things to an unarmed populous though.
t1_duvf573	0.318200	*	You're confusing how much GCP's current market share is with how much actual capacity Google has ready to put behind it at a moment's notice.

t1_duith3v	0.000000	*	Are you not aware the vast majority of the world lives without indoor plumbing and running water?
t1_dua66v3	-0.859300	*	If someone is ready to kill people.... obtaining a gun illegally is a trivial concern.  In short... you're punishing law-abiding citizens for the actions of criminal and not treating the real problem.
t1_duz92s0	0.729100	*	Yah, I died three times growing up. /s  This isn't to say it's acceptable or not a big problem.  But, for example, we have a much bigger bloodbath on our roads than any problem of deliberate violence.
t1_dugofeu	0.000000	*	This was a very civil resolution.
t1_duqm6u8	0.361200	*	Not even gonna read this bullshit buddy.  I don't need a lecture on consent.
t1_dv0aa3x	-0.739100	*	Don't forget the Mongols who conquered with genocide. Oh and the Chinese, Japanese, mug hals, ottomans.... you get the drift 
t1_dur9md2	0.128000	*	Cars have a purpose. Their purpose is to get someone from point A to point B. Guns don't have any other purpose outside of recreation and murdering(for the vast majority of the population).
t1_duyfsnr	-0.710500	*	The military would splinter like it always has in such scenarios. 
t1_dv47c4c	0.250000	*	That's a terribly thin bit of bait. You'd make a great reporter for some shitrag like HuffPo.
t1_duod9e4	0.000000	*	What other Constitutional right requires a license?  (Driving is not a right.)
t1_dv03808	0.000000	*	One generation is long enough.

t1_dui3yzm	0.128000	*	Right, but did the practice end? I have to say I genuinely don't know. I haven't heard of any legislation that would put an end to it, so  I'm just assuming it didn't.  
t1_dv0lr2p	0.000000	*	You work 6 hours a day with a break? Lmao. That's incredible. 
t1_dukd87v	-0.250000	*	some people say is code for retards.
t1_dv1rnbx	0.000000	*	It kind of is, though? Nostalgia is about being wistful and sentimental, which carries strong implications of not being totally accurate

t1_dufr1de	0.074500	*	Why don't you enlighten us with the truth then?
t1_duie1yd	0.174400	*	So if I was rich I'd just need to buy a farm before I died. Then my kids could decide that farming isn't for them and sell it off to a different old rich guy. 
t1_dug6lxn	0.000000	*	No shit thats why Im here, the point Im making is I dont value the opinion of some overpaid primadonna who doesnt even know what hes talking about in the first place. 
t1_dv0euwe	-0.296000	*	> that makes it possible to silence any mention of polish participation in these attrocities  Participation is not responsibility

t1_dugldzm	-0.169500	*	Martial Law will be implemented if Trump gets away with this. That's when the real pain is going to begin for society.
t1_dv01g7e	-0.180800	*	Economic mobility is still incredibly low in the US.  In fact, much lower than the post WWII boom.  Also, economic mobility for blacks is lower than whites, once again due to systemic racism.

t1_dugm0te	0.000000	*	Is publicly endorsing a group that wants to kill or impirson LGBT people divisive? Is explicetly saying in your Party platform that gay people are second class citizens and should remain so divisive? 
t1_durppv0	0.000000	*	>I don't particularly care what criminals think, they'll (try to) do what they want anyway.    That's kinda the whole progun argument.
t1_dv15urd	-0.025800	*	That is dumb as fuck. They get paid to not farm to help the local environment right? Fuck farmers for literally shitting on their local environments.
t1_dv2v2yn	-0.598800	*	What? That's not helpful... Do you care to explain why you're so disdainful of my comment?

t1_dv57gf2	-0.964400	*	Sadly, its probably necessary when you consider how well-armed our criminals are. The whole situation is wrong.
t1_dusjacj	-0.585900	*	Not even a little.   The wall is being built. If he wants, he can make Mexico pay for it. I don't really want him to take that route because it would be an anti trade move. 
t1_dunrup4	0.000000	*	How many POWs you know gave out secrets willingly? You support those kinds of people? You support traitors?
t1_dur92xx	0.401900	*	China seems to be doing all right.  EDIT: Yes I get it, they've been doing well because they've started integrating capitalist ideals into a state that was previously 100% Marxist.
t1_dud9bto	0.000000	*	Did you comment to the wrong thread because this has nothing to do with the topic. Man get over it Hillary didn't win. #she isnt my president

t1_duxi4ra	0.000000	*	Theyd sit in a garage with the car running if guns are banned. You think suicides will go down because gun ownership goes down? 
t1_duidxi6	0.510600	*	I suppose that is a possible exception for ring-wraiths.  There are no exceptions for the first two categories.

t1_dv0vy8h	0.778300	*	False pretenses. 
t1_dugct4b	0.000000	*	That's still over $50 billion that goes to other countries. I understand it's purpose, but when your country's own citizens need help, shouldn't you cut back some and help them?
t1_dutcg70	-0.421500	*	at least it is just a planned proposal.  I thought it has already passed from the title.  even as a proposal it is a scary thought.

t1_duyl7fb	-0.585900	*	I dont know. He would have a significant opposition in the GOP. I think he would still own an election but there would still be some strong opposition on the right.

t1_dv14y6e	0.000000	*	I can't imagine you picking a worse example. Sprint, run, jog, walk, meander.   You're complaining about a fundamental and necessary feature that's used in literally every language in the world. 
t1_dug9wmw	0.670500	*	You haven't put forth any kinda argument other than let's keep all the illegals cause we wanna pick and choose laws like everyone else 
t1_duh1z5i	0.000000	*	When it comes to basic logical consistency, not having any is implicit in your entire unraveling thesis.

t1_dv2645u	0.476700	*	Have you been reading the thread? It is more about China and EU than anything. 
t1_duxxzt5	-0.296000	*	Nobody's crusading bro, it's just what it is. The culture's changing and the world's becoming a very different place.
t1_duhxljx	-0.296000	*	Honestly the entirety of the Harry Potter series is more likely drug fuelled hallucinations to mask Harry being abused in a paedophile ring for profit for his uncle.

t1_ducpx35	-0.784500	*	Right except in most of those other countries the government sanctioned penalty for simply disagreeing or thinking differently than the government allows is death.

t1_dutlel5	-0.240600	*	If you're going to continue to hammer this point, correct spelling would lend greater legitimacy to your argument. It's (IN OBNOXIOUS ITALICS) superseded (END OBNOXIOUS ITALICS), NOT 'supersceded'

t1_duto09v	0.819600	*	I don't suggest anything, I just think there needs to be an awareness of the dangers so people can make informed decisions and not just parrot hype.  It's a real problem.

t1_dut5cct	-0.661000	*	I was on your side until you made this comment... maybe one of the most naive things Ive ever read.
t1_dujurln	-0.862500	*	You and your Ilk can downvote me, and call me names, all you like. That will do nothing to change my mind, or make socialism any less evil.
t1_dugjsjf	-0.718400	*	I agree, Israel is about 95% white if you do not count the occupied zones which are basically concentration camps. Israel lacks diversity, it shouldn't be such a racist country in this day and age.

t1_durqvbp	-0.624900	*	Downvoting? Idk what you're talking about. You should be less emotional about this stuff. Why are you against Venezuela progressing?

t1_duubjni	-0.778300	*	I'm not sure why that would offend you.  You would gladly feed them your countrymen.
t1_duptnrr	-0.361200	*	That was the same argument Mugabe made in Zimbabwe.  It turns out, he didn't give the land to farmers, he gave them to cronies and the land was basically ruined for agriculture.

t1_dup6vrd	0.000000	*	Well I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, I heard tons of people publicly say the only reason they preferred Hillary was because she would be the first female president. 
t1_dugp3us	-0.875600	*	What about the aliens and stuff? Or the russian/china-inside-job conspiracy?  Havent there been any new conspiracy popping up? SocialMediaConspiracy, FlatEarthConspiracy?
t1_duqbdpp	-0.872000	*	Yeah, I always find it hilarious to hear Americans complain about the price of gas and I wonder if they've ever been outside of their country.
t1_duuftx6	0.858500	*	Indeed. I should note that I never attacked vaccines in particular with that argument. My concerns have been with over prescribed medicines and the vitamin industry.
t1_dv1c70j	0.000000	*	In regards to integrating into the US or Europe?  What do you mean?
t1_dumg61t	-0.164400	*	Just pointing out the fact that R.O.C. did not form because of the civil war. It was the defacto Chinese government till then. 
t1_dui920y	0.421500	*	https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Location=New-York-NY/Salary/by_Degree  Actually it would be the case pretty soundly.

t1_dueg702	0.000000	*	It's the proportion that matters here, I think. Smaller airports in Europe would still likely operate a large number of international flights, vs the US where that isn't  the case.
t1_dua5sn1	0.027600	*	Fine, then change the law so that police have a legal obligation to protect you and can respond withing 60 seconds. Until then, fuck off

t1_duidw0p	0.854800	*	Right, but the whole point of Social Security was to be a minimum safety net for people too old to work. So in that sense, the poor have to get out more than what they pay in.

t1_dv0xp4d	0.000000	*	How do you decide who the expert is and how he's hired? Likely, it will be industry leaders anyway, and you're back to where you started.
t1_duobgkm	0.051600	*	With lobbying we have legalized bribery. America's a business first, democracy second. I love my country though, it's just sad and frustrating.

t1_duomc72	-0.611500	*	No, it doesnt surprise me. I go to the same gun shops that any gun owner would. Id say $700 is about the median cost for a pistol. Sure some are cheaper though. 
t1_dv3cqny	0.000000	*	Except for his love for white supremacist groups symbol.   I love the KKK, swastikas, holocaust denial, but I'm not a white supremacist. I just hate non-whites! What's wrong with that?
t1_ducsf57	0.526700	*	Why didn't it happen immediately? He blatantly ignored the sanctions and there were no reprocussions. That's why I'm negative that anything will happen to him.
t1_dub87kd	-0.659700	*	Damn that one greedy nurse looking to have her wage unfrozen! She's the problem...not the people hiding away their millions refusing to pay their fair share...

t1_durc8il	0.000000	*	It's also extremely common to assume that homeless people are lying about their situation so we can avoid empathy. 
t1_duky4lw	0.541300	*	I was like holy shit I never want to meet anyone like that.  Either drama queen or mentally unstable.
t1_duwndbk	-0.476700	*	Don't worry people are going to have children still whether or not they can actually afford them
t1_duuiofn	0.000000	*	You're talking about drip coffee though (i think?). The uk mainly has espresso based coffees so they're more expensive.
t1_dut1aeh	0.273200	*	Yes
t1_duz4xli	-0.296000	*	Are you trying to imply that I believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories?  The irony coming form a muh Russia leftie is huge.

t1_dust3jg	-0.946500	*	Yes because corporate lobbyists definitely control every aspect of every political decision in the USA and is totally comparable with the situation in China.
t1_dv4sfy5	0.361200	*	How do feed it to make it sustainable? 
t1_dupuy5h	0.000000	*	Also automated gun traps and mines. 
t1_duqcjn6	0.077200	*	>Mussolini's anti-Semitism was luke-warm  Wait wouldnt be non-existent if he didnt play race politics? Luke-warm suggests it existed, which is the opposite of what you said before.

t1_duo5obq	-0.891000	*	I would like to see 1 single credible source at all that says the US murdered or even directly killed even 1% of the number *6 million* you keep claiming.  Just 1.
t1_dueq6n1	-0.476700	*	Well I'm from the US, so for me it's a distraction from all the other political crap going on. I'm pretty much already burnt out on politics just from domestic politics. 
t1_dug2a4v	0.000000	*	Proof?
t1_duwq246	-0.348500	*	That's not ad hominem. If you're going to invoke something like a goddamn magic word, at least try to use it properly.  Hahaha he fucking deleted it.
t1_duhwcwm	0.000000	*	If it's heavily regulated at the cost for consumers, how come so many Americans get billed tens of thousands of dollars for barely 24 hours in a hospital?

t1_dv13d9v	-0.381800	*	I dont understand the content of your comment.  Whats this about bragging?  OP said that there werent protests in China.  Every single link (and item you quoted) refutes that.  
t1_duc5ffg	-0.310700	*	Dammit, I knew I should have specifically excluded Gardasil, which oddly bridges those two topics.  I mean things like Tdap.
t1_dusel9i	-0.659700	*	The shelter also has bombs and bullets flying around it like the sword of damocles though. And even if you survive, there's no guarantee you'll survive intact.
t1_dv0ujkn	0.000000	*	Yelling fire in a crowded theater is NOT overturned.  It has to do with damages resulting in your (poorly thought out) speech.

t1_duof3e1	-0.700300	*	Putin is loved by his supporters as the guy who pulled russia back from the brink from their recent past.   > worst time in living memory  Pretty sure people there still remember WWII/Stalin.

t1_dv026w9	0.000000	*	Did you just assume that words genderlessness?
t1_dv27q9t	0.000000	*	>KNOW YOUR ENEMY  I do; they're the teachers who taught me to fight me. 
t1_dutecw5	-0.102700	*	I was in absolute shock he won. But like I mentioned in a previous comment, some studies showed Trump supporters have lower iqs than average....so I guess America is just full of retards.
t1_duobgkm	0.000000	*	With lobbying we have legalized bribery. America's a business first, democracy second. I love my country though, it's just sad and frustrating.
t1_dup6xfc	0.525500	*	Yeah rigging the primary by the dnc really shows overwhelming support by the base...Not to mention the low voter turn out in the election aka the reason Trump won.
t1_duxnyd2	-0.027600	*	Nobody is using your unshaved dirty armpits to oppress you. Hijabs are used to oppress women. 
t1_dukcc57	0.636900	*	Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope.  Hell no.  Uh uh.  Fuck right off.

t1_duocw3r	-0.930800	*	Its likely that all these shooters would have got the license.  
t1_duj6efc	0.251600	*	Not sure. All we know is that Obama raided more than Bush after sending the ogden memo out saying they'd be left alone.
t1_dusj9iv	0.718400	*	Awesome. I'm sure glad that's what we're spending money on than Healthcare for our citizens.. 
t1_duz35jd	-0.645700	*	The fact that we're arguing about it (as opposed to easily agreeing that he has dementia) is evidence that he's hiding it pretty well (or that there isn't an issue at all). 
t1_dv51qs3	-0.361600	*	It used to mean that. The terms in use in academia now are global north and global south and have more to do with standard of living for an average person.
t1_dv3hmtb	0.000000	*	But the DNC did steal the primary election? DNC chair Tom Perez and former interim chair Donna Brazile both admitted it at different times. 
t1_dul92mk	0.361200	*	I could swear he was talking about Turkey.
t1_durd1vn	-0.945900	*	They question if the military personnel would use such weapons against their countrymen or if they'd refuse service. 
t1_dulmqc8	0.000000	*	Well, I mean I could use my phone calculator but it'd be annoying to copy paste numbers that large. 
t1_duc4suh	0.440400	*	Im fine, I like Apple 
t1_dv1o75z	-0.296000	*	Why? Did you just get that from a tweet or Facebook post? That isnt a checkmate like you think it is.

t1_dut3xht	-0.839900	*	Again, corporations only have power because we as a country decide to
t1_duh1sa4	0.911800	*	I seem to remember this coming up in a thread before, and that's there's precedent that accepting a pardon is not an admission of guilt, legally speaking. I have no idea if that's true or not.
t1_duk835n	-0.599400	*	I mean I guess. But its passive aggressive rather then genocidal. 
t1_dupsukv	-0.766100	*	A portion which is badly spent. When you say don't criticise military spending you are saying don't criticise corruption. 
t1_dv0lwnf	-0.102700	*	That's still pretty dumb. I don't want complete strangers hopping my fence and squatting in my back yard
t1_dv0rayu	0.731900	*	Why are GM foods labeled and regular foods not labeled? The same rules should apply to both.

t1_dul5gzs	-0.338200	*	I think that was the joke :)
t1_duj29bg	0.166500	*	and I don't think you understand how loved canada is, and how much of a dicking the rest of the world would give you for invading canada for water/resources.

t1_duj1m9y	0.636900	*	Not surprising. Aussies are involved in all of US's wars, illegal or not. 
t1_duct79u	0.000000	*	What? French-Canadians aren't reason enough for you?
t1_dv4125t	-0.440400	*	Godwin gave us until infinity to reach Hitler.  We did it in 10.

t1_dug9kuo	-0.695600	*	Yes you're correct. However the person you replied to made a simple mistake and you got all in their ass about it. 
t1_duz8pyg	0.000000	*	The government as a whole is the victim, not the corrupt individuals. You used the entire government as part of your phrase.

t1_dv1ojl9	0.258900	*	They literally said that freedom of speech wasn't a thing in France. Which is a blatant lie.
t1_ducznc0	0.000000	*	Going after 13 people specifically for subverting an entire countries election by essentially trolling seems like a pretty big witch hunt. 
t1_duugeor	0.680800	*	That's not how ponzi schemes work.  They don't keep growing and growing for decades and decades. 
t1_duzyual	0.476700	*	I feel you must be on Tumblr a lot, and are just projecting. Or can't think of anything to say so just use Tumblr as an insult?  Either way it's quiet strange. 
t1_dv381jm	-0.064400	*	No one knows. It hasn't been tested in court.
t1_duy88mp	0.025800	*	The guns arent to fight the government.

t1_dujpotd	0.571900	*	I really don't get how people can buy into this blatant bullshit. Man oh man.
t1_dug6jlq	-0.873300	*	That's the only point you've come to make? I must really be onto something...
t1_dugrlod	-0.202300	*	I was(n't) talking about the bias lieberal schools have against conservative students. Don't get so emotional.
t1_dv01qf5	0.000000	*	6% of a country =/= a country.
t1_dv1x9jx	0.025800	*	It is clearly a tongue in cheek joke in the video. The whole video, not the clipped version that made the Facebook rounds.

t1_dudvgqc	-0.153100	*	I mean...it works, but now I'm stuck with an Aztec.  You-... you wanna buy an Aztec?
t1_duqs9s8	0.735100	*	This only works if you inherit a good sum of money.
t1_duqms04	-0.296000	*	In her case the return she wants is an increase in conservatism.

t1_dv2ytmu	0.493900	*	I don't know, comments seem to indicate that people got it. Saying it like I was serious was part of the joke. It's alright, sometimes satire is easy to miss.
t1_dv4t7jz	-0.855500	*	But it's not a HE-F grenade, which is what is most commonly referred to as a grenade. Stun-grenades are are known colloquially as flashbangs. 
t1_duqu414	0.750600	*	Why is it bad whem urban areas 'dictate' things for rural people, but not the othet way around?
t1_dv33w5e	0.837900	*	Who is saying that Russia doesn't trying to influence the US?  When have they not?
t1_duza3z8	0.000000	*	That's not why the Crimea was annexed. Putin needed to keep the naval base that Ukraine might have decided against letting Russia use if they were to join NATO.
t1_dut3xm7	0.585900	*	They are yeah but i believe mine is closer to truth than yours. Funny thing is you will never realize this when you actually live in the US, too much of a bubble. 
t1_dv2ckaa	0.493900	*	> fucking bigots  Troll better.
t1_duq4r5c	0.000000	*	If you knew anything about Sanders' position, it was that the sanctions were not enough in his opinion.  Also, it doesn't matter because it was massively (like 98%) voted in favor anyway.

t1_duwl3zs	-0.836000	*	We would need about 4 earths then
t1_duw6yq5	0.351500	*	Of course.  My point is simply that throwing 30k at a dog isnt worth it when it deprives 10,000 others of vision.  The same might be true for climate change.

t1_durpf2y	0.746900	*	Or you know, a check against mob rule. Democrats are known to run big cities, possibly because they are not exposed to the individualistic ideology of the rural life.

t1_dv3mi2k	-0.296000	*	At this point we don't know what evidence the investigators have or will have in the future, there are no guarantees yet.

t1_duhzamw	0.000000	*	I didnt say it was 'as bad', just that its not the answer the islamification of Europe. Claiming HIV isnt as bad as cancer isnt an endorsement of HIV either.
t1_dv35moj	0.202300	*	The difference is you see the odd comment with these sentiments in r/politics, on the Donald there are literally posts with thousands of up votes and comments doing it.
t1_dulygqy	0.874800	*	Because France would certainly not be there if it had no other geopolitical interests.  It doesn't mean Mali isn't served by France's own interests, but this is an indirect side effect.

t1_duk82iq	0.000000	*	I'm not saying you're wrong. You could well be right. But nothing you just said refutes the source or their claim. You just attacked the source.

t1_dv30vae	0.526700	*	Arguing morality with a moral-relativist is like trying to punch a teleporter. Feeling right trumps acting right in this arena. Use an empathy attack for maximum damage.

t1_duxjfo6	-0.801600	*	So, evil. That's the flip side of insane, and also very a very misinformed picture. Your political opponents are neither crazy nor evil. They have different values than you.
t1_duzzz7e	-0.226300	*	*US media gives more of a shit about the POTUS than racist remarks by a South African politician that got 6% in the elections*  Must be the jews

t1_durxnys	0.273200	*	Exactly what it says, a right to do something is, by definition, a right. Whether or not it is good or should be afforded to people is another discussion.

t1_duqmh0y	0.000000	*	This isn't t_d some people actually have informed opinions around here.
t1_dudrxty	-0.865800	*	That's no excuse though. Apparently it shows Japan must endure another military defeat in the future to correct its path once for all.
t1_duhcuf9	0.756200	*	The president can preemptively pardon people. Ford did it to Nixon.
t1_dv4vah9	-0.408500	*	Subways can be very sustainable and adding additional layers to preexisting services is a step forward.

t1_duq4sqg	0.381800	*	Except for this new president who wants to do that? By large scale I meant any organized move to redistribute land, as opposed to singular cases.
t1_dud76hm	0.565700	*	nothing referring to the comparison with a traffic violation to the scenario you just mentioned 
t1_duehfnw	0.000000	*	Same as Australia. Its both a state and federal issue. Free public hospitals are run by the states, but they receive federal funds.

t1_dv29v25	-0.859100	*	I think this is it.  Faced with the russian scandal he needs a diversion. Needs to look 'presidented'.  Needs to look like he's actually doing something.   It's a PR stunt.

t1_ducsile	-0.798600	*	Trump obviously ignores sanctions he signed and nothing happened to him. That's part of the reason I feel he is untouchable.

t1_dv04upa	0.102700	*	Nope just my personal interactions trying to explain to some people that white people can also be victims of racism. I dont think theyve done tests on the subject.

t1_dv4sx7e	0.000000	*	You shouldn't. That's why you should teach Germany (and everyone else) a lesson by pulling out.  We got the same goals.

t1_duylzww	-0.174400	*	The evidence of the violation is the classified emails being sent.  It's pretty cute and dry when you look at the law that was violated.  Interestingly enough, it says nothing about intent, either.
t1_duhp3x2	0.546000	*	**Well as per the constitution it is your** *RIGHT* **to be armed enough to be able to resist the government. So the government should furnish you with Reaper Drones and F-35's.**

t1_dv6yczj	0.035600	*	Today the us is drone bombing heaps of countries and is occupying Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria currently. How is Russia or china worse in terms of warring?
t1_dufmsbv	0.000000	*	I guess we wont get anywhere, you obviously just have a problem race while i have a problem with the ideas.  Are you okay with islandic people converting as long as they are white or what?
t1_dueep2p	-0.726900	*	Replace Russians with black people or Asian people or anyone else and that sentence makes you a bigot.
t1_duzcx5b	0.361200	*	Assault weapon isn't a term. Educate yourself on guns. No point in even arguing with you

t1_duguh3n	0.177900	*	2020.  To be sure, people should vote this year as well, in primaries especially, but come 2020 Sanders will wipe the floor with any corporate stooge going for the nomination.
t1_ducucc0	0.000000	*	There are/were US military groups involved in things like this in certain areas of the world (e.g. Iraq, at least during the occupation). 
t1_duh1sa4	0.329100	*	I seem to remember this coming up in a thread before, and that's there's precedent that accepting a pardon is not an admission of guilt, legally speaking. I have no idea if that's true or not.
t1_dut3qv0	0.815000	*	Americans aren't magical creatures, every single oppressive government ever had its collaborators and a tyrannical American government is no exception.

t1_duhw7eg	0.810500	*	> I go back and forth between China and Europe. Im well versed with people on both sides.  Like I said, you're a European visiting China just like I am an American in Asia.
t1_durhj7r	0.757900	*	In the UK at least, Bill Gates basically said The UK needs to teach computer science in schools and bam, there it was. Schools I know have been teaching it for about 5 years now.
t1_dunx214	0.000000	*	Here in Arkansas, it's a plastic cup for large sodas, styrofoam for large teas, and everything else is a waxed paper cup. How common is it for someone to order a large drink there?

t1_duosgpt	0.000000	*	Awesome Brazil is backing their new Petro cryptocurrency with barrels of oil. Its nice to see Russia is backing a new crypto coin with cocaine. Whats it called? Coco?
t1_duyg0og	0.077200	*	Except there is no evidence anywhere that that is an issue. Except an orange idiot that has an active imagination. But what does logic and evidence have to do with anything right?

t1_duqay10	-0.296000	*	I'm simply pointing out that the above poster saying he is stealing it is fucking stupid.  And of course stealing isn't a death sentence just pointing out the above poster is being an ass
t1_durqntf	-0.932500	*	Denying the reality of others' free agency might be easier than admitting your politics are on the fringe, but it doesn't constitute proof of social-engineering conspiracy.
t1_dv1qsx4	0.296000	*	Edit: sorry I forgot I was on world news...  Fuck Trump! It's his fault for global warming and the hurricanes anyway!
t1_dv0c46b	0.000000	*	People like you are the problem.
t1_dv1h4ut	0.000000	*	No amount of R&D would make it cost effective. We need a fundamentally different way of traveling through space.
t1_dui8u8w	0.421500	*	My parents make a little over $50k a year *together*. North Carolina is shit, though.
t1_dui35ir	0.893100	*	Really? What kind of jobs did middle class western women do in the 16th - 19th centuries? I always thought they were just homemakers, aside from some farming wives and maids

t1_dudpp4w	-0.895700	*	British colonism had a direct impact on the state of these countries. The holocaust is a bit of an iffy link, a very bad analogy all in all.
t1_dull15e	-0.526700	*	Work in hospital as a tech, and my wife is an RN.  We've both seen a lot of shit at this point, both literally and figuratively. 
t1_dug4cuf	-0.996100	*	Careful.. that doesnt fit the guns kill people agenda.  
t1_dv39mf8	0.000000	*	I was banned from the Donald for one post, I replied to a comment about illegal immigration and said only citizens can vote.  This level of censorship is clearly unamerican.
t1_dulawuv	-0.703900	*	TLDR - I assume from your long post that you prefer that retard as president.
t1_durkwe8	0.000000	*	I think you just were a shitty student that didn't pay attention during that unit. We covered the Trail of Tears at least 5 different times during my Public School upbringing...
t1_duwng3y	0.485900	*	You're really too optimistic on this whole AI thing.  I'd lay off the scifi shows and movies. Best stay away from /r/futurology.
t1_duqrood	0.296000	*	Blame that one on US business.  They felt it was a competitive advantage to make things in non-metric sizes reducing the volume advantages Asia had.  
t1_dulr2by	0.467800	*	Why didnt large terrorist groups emerge from Latin America when they have had a ton of meddling for centuries/decades as well?
t1_dujl40s	0.000000	*	The greatest times in the history of time. Believe me!
t1_duv78su	-0.962000	*	Paywalled :) but just Portland alone had more kiddie rape per capita than Rotherham did https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-or/legacy/2013/10/29/the_csec_report.pdf  Lol
t1_duv0mt5	0.347000	*	Actually I just said you *didn't* lie about them - somehow you managed to omit any mention of them, instead claiming several years of study.  Are you capable of posting in good faith at all?

t1_dusx46a	0.000000	*	Hey! Tigers can call each other ti**er, but you shouldn't ever say it!
t1_dubgt8k	0.202300	*	I dont know. Seems like big government trying control private businesses to me. 
t1_dv1wct7	0.177900	*	And your telling me that is somehow supposed to convince me to have more respect for your state?  Fuck em twice, and move if you don't like it. Sounds like a lost fucking cause.
t1_duehvxs	-0.804300	*	I would imagine war would have to be declared on a particular country in order to have a charge of treason.   Im also smoking pot out of an apple right now so...
t1_dutbhzi	-0.694600	*	Still, these statistics doesn't show what people actually read. And it doesn't show that VG only has 5% of total readers. As far as I can tell, correct me if I'm wrong.
t1_dv5bv8b	0.000000	*	So post those sources. My proof is the fact that he was her boss and therefore in charge of the policy as per the Constitution.
t1_dv1tvsp	0.000000	*	We pushed to recall Walker. In the end there was a lot of tax payer money spent to market the movement and form proper protests etc... it failed, even though the state SEEMED super united.
t1_dui9lzs	0.874200	*	Pre-tax 24,000. 
t1_dustykk	0.440400	*	Yes mate. Get behind that fucking wall where we don't have to look at your ugly mugs ever again and take that senile cheesy puff with you.

t1_duk347r	-0.934400	*	Is Trump somehow preventing people from planting more trees? Am I missing something?

t1_dug8u5a	0.012900	*	And users would just create accounts on websites outside of this regulation.
t1_duys5kk	0.000000	*	You need to go to school.
t1_dur8vvg	0.421500	*	Yes, but if you ignore all that, they're still moral in their minds...  
t1_dusg5l3	0.000000	*	So now the famine was solely caused by Indian peasants owning massive amounts of debt? Who is trying to move goalposts?  
t1_dut356l	0.492700	*	Way to put words in my mouth. This is why any meaningful discussion on reddit is futile, you either join the circlejerk or eventually get called a fascist.

t1_dukehev	0.461500	*	Do it without your annual welfare checks from the US taxpayer then.  Our citizens need help more than your military.  Have some pride.
t1_duw25pa	0.000000	*	I am an environmental consultant. I help a variety of different clients including public agencies look into climate change issues and GHG emissions.
t1_dv1n8xe	0.000000	*	Did you even read the article? Steel and aluminum will be taxed heavily, so everything made out of steel or aluminum will become more expensive. 
t1_duqcwl6	-0.493900	*	The demecrats will fool me no more. They get you on hollow words of generic hope and change... but lay down and take it when some thing goes against the will of their donors 
t1_duqoaua	0.889900	*	And that's worth 500k to a Russian banker why? 
t1_dur7odq	0.612400	*	We removed guns from school to stop gang violence. It mostly worked, so we've got that going for us.
t1_duxy4z5	-0.718400	*	That's not remotely close to what r/madlads is about. I give up
t1_duako95	-0.269500	*	Ok that makes sense. So where did all the figures come from of us losing money? And the phantom xa3350mil a week thing?

t1_duacosb	-0.153100	*	It implies that there are no restrictions on immigration which isn't true.
t1_duyo0o7	-0.863600	*	Whataboutism.  You ashamed you voted for him when deep down you knew who he was the whole time?  Is that why you bring up Clinton to justify your terrible decision because you were fucking proud?

t1_dv0t1r7	-0.825400	*	We do have trot, jog, and skip. Also no one is making up a new word. The example we're referring to is 'reverse racism' which is using 'adjectives or adverbs' just as you suggest right? 
t1_dumy2wr	0.077200	*	Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me
t1_dudrxdw	0.250000	*	Australia loves a good monopoly or duopoly. Even moreso if we gift them the infrastructure our parents paid for
t1_dv3ezn0	0.659000	*	Due to your question being too open ended and as I pointed out, utterly irrelevant.  When was the last time Israel sent troops to places that weren't there's and the troops weren't wanted? Today.

t1_duq8vjg	0.258400	*	It's just stupid.  Especially when you have hard data to back it up.  As a county, if you ban guns, violent deaths drop dramatically.  This is proven. It's not a debate.

t1_duq6npc	0.066500	*	>buy-backs  What happens when someone decides he doesn't want to sell his weapon? Will he be compelled by force? That's confiscation. Will he be punished legally? That's making him a criminal. 
t1_dur86yn	0.000000	*	What did the Germans do with the refugees? 
t1_dui1f22	-0.557400	*	having two world wars certainly helped as well. America didn't get destroyed or anything so they could help the others rebuild while having an easy live themselves

t1_dv33sji	0.000000	*	Do you have a source for that?
t1_dur1puk	0.202300	*	You are correct. Finland and Denmark are both capitalist welfare states. I don't know why so many Americans think we're socialist.

t1_dururem	-0.381800	*	The media.
t1_duoy9k1	0.827100	*	You have no data to back that up.    There were plenty of reasons not to vote for Hillary, and why you presume that's something everybody would have done is erroneous.

t1_duqlcug	0.636900	*	Well, I still think Kennedy was the modern pinnacle of Democrat Presidents. It's been sliding downwards since.
t1_dv2il5e	0.000000	*	The most powerful and influential nation on the planet to which millions of people flock to get in?

t1_dur92xx	-0.739200	*	China seems to be doing all right.  EDIT: Yes I get it, they've been doing well because they've started integrating capitalist ideals into a state that was previously 100% Marxist.

t1_dulkge9	0.000000	*	So you can't point any that I hold. Cool. I feel the wind from the goalposts moving.  But what extreme views are highly up voted on Kia? Have any examples of that?
t1_dv0th8o	-0.440400	*	You should look into monopoly on violence and state power. If she refuses to obey she will be met with violence. It's inherent in every interaction with government. 
t1_duyq94r	-0.177900	*	Truly the right attitude. Cheers mate
t1_dv103hr	0.000000	*	I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that we were discussing four year olds in particular.  Because we weren't.  Censorship in general is stupid.

t1_dupmbd9	0.000000	*	> Eu doesnt recognize officially Congo genocide.  That's because they were atrocities, not a genocide. Probably best you do your research before you continue to make yourself look silly.

t1_due5ocl	-0.578100	*	Oh Americans definitely *believe* Russia as an enemy you're right about that, I thought you were implying that Russia is the enemy of other countries. My bad.

t1_dufphom	0.746900	*	I routinely see posts quoting and lending credence to obviously disingenuous arguments from articles and opinion pieces get downvoted.  Might you be confusing that for what you're describing?

t1_duj3a82	0.000000	*	Someone obviously knows nothing about the Islamic golden age. Regions and science have not been at odds religious people have always been the forefront of science. 
t1_dur71fa	-0.296000	*	Okay. 7000 / 350,000,000 = 0.002%  You were off by two orders of magnitude. And besides, one child dying in a school shooting is one too many. Im not even sure why your incorrect math matters here.

t1_dv0dmrm	-0.250000	*	Would've been the same even if he divulged only the domestic bit.
t1_dv58noq	0.273200	*	No I didn't.  They were 2 different examples I made and you got fixated on one of them and ignored the other.

t1_duaenvh	0.000000	*	Don't be obtuse, I'm not specifically talking about school shooting here, any time there's a bust with plainclothes police involved you don't hear about them getting shot accidentally do you?

t1_dubnug4	-0.241100	*	To be fair it's a pretty liberal site, and she did win the popular vote. You'd expect the majority of liberals on reddit to be pro Hilary, even if the Sanders guys were pretty loud. 
t1_dubcjg6	0.000000	*	I realize that there are shills in social media. If you are going to call out the Russians, then maybe you should call out all of them. They're on both sides.

t1_dup4i9y	-0.168000	*	So it's ok to discriminate me based on my opinion, even if it's unpopular and I'm in the minority? Why your opinion is OK and mine is shit? How about some tolerance which you praise?

t1_dudsx2l	0.777400	*	What? Creationism is one of the main points of Christianity.  Literally the first verse of the entire Bible is In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth.
t1_dug7vxs	0.757400	*	It's okay I'm used to it. People read a few articles and think they've expertly mastered Iraq. Wish local Iraqi news was more frequently available in English.

t1_dujcpo6	0.555900	*	I think people should be allowed to book double rooms without being discriminated because of their sexual orientation.  His preference is less valid because it is bigoted.

t1_dugnpo5	0.644200	*	I am critical of Russia because of Crimea. Yes. It is a big world. But Crimea is something much larger than any of those as far as I am concerned.
t1_dv01n6d	0.275500	*	That's because reverse racism isn't a real thing!! It's literally a poor excuse to justify more racism. Reverse racism = Racism
