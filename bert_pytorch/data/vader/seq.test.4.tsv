t1_duv9ihr	0.000000	*	Lived in Bali several years. The locals simply did not understand the damage they were doing. Burned garbage, and when told it was really really toxic - they just shrugged their shoulders.

t1_duf2vte	-0.718400	*	Also don't have to worry about pulling the foreskin back to piss. Knowing what I'm missing I'm definitely ok with if not glad of being cut.
t1_dunke8e	0.615400	*	It helps create that impression when all of the media hostile to Putin has been closed down, and difficult investigative journalists get thrown off buildings. 
t1_dua6kaw	0.000000	*	Id say Brexit will be more damaging to the UK than Trump to USA. 
t1_dv0t6bu	0.296000	*	Indoor farming uses pesticides. Ever been in a greenhouse? Pest outbreaks indoors can be ever worse than outdoors.

t1_duhu7eg	-0.735100	*	I believe we were still running a deficit though.
t1_duqpsos	0.326200	*	I doubt Trump had anything to do with it. If your position is being attacked, the tendency is to defend yourself. The Russian mercs didn't raise a flag and were fair game.

t1_duztxv3	-0.659700	*	Yes, this. The whites can't realistically fight back. There will be no war, just victims.
t1_dur5g5f	0.000000	*	Exactly. Nothing wrong with paying for the services of a sex worker but messing with children, as this article mentions, is straight outa Satan's playbook.

t1_duf5w9m	-0.797100	*	It's disingenuous to even call r/politics 'politics'. It's a giant fucking echo chamber that's no better than r/the_donald.  The fact that r/neutralpolitics exists is all you need to know.

t1_duqzy0o	-0.558400	*	Im just simply asking how they deserve any more money than those suffering in America. We are a prosperous country but we arent perfect and people are in need of help. How can we just ignore them?
t1_dv2gpox	0.250000	*	Cause we have no corruption now? Term limits stops a few from gaining power to kill any other bill or discussion while leading to the same old bullshit.

t1_dusx2d1	0.440400	*	We're rare as North Koreans around these parts
t1_dui4ecj	-0.401900	*	Maybe punishment was a poor word choice. Does it not feel unfair to tax rich  people substantially more? They have  more money yes but they earned it.

t1_duebeuv	-0.401900	*	Lets compare countries invaded by USA vs DPRK, and we'll see who's falling for propaganda. The USA wants absolute control of the globe, the DPRK just wants sovereignty.

t1_dupg95n	0.510600	*	Wait is that what the reference was in doctor who with Danny Pink? I thought it was just because he would have had to be fit in the army but if that's a thing in the UK it makes more sense. 
t1_durdg7y	0.446600	*	So 1. I thought this was a nationwide march not just in DC?  And 2. I'm not sure that's the greatest use of funds if you're flying people across the country for this

t1_duuywbu	0.000000	*	Correct. In Trump's mind, every single person in this nation loves him. If they don't, that's fake news, and is simultaneously Crooked Hillary's fault.

t1_dv00vv2	0.000000	*	This is what surprises me. I'd have expected the West to come to defend them. Or is it because there is no oil or other natural resource to exploit so they aren't interested?
t1_duf17md	-0.612400	*	Which is insane because as the old ad based model of journalism collapses we should be expanding the CBC and other publicly funded media not cutting its funding. 
t1_dusf7ao	-0.544600	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is never going to be built and even if it were there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it, no matter what he says.

t1_duzk0yo	-0.025800	*	Im white and do business in Compton. Dont pretend like you can draw any equivalent to places in the states. Cops go into shitty neighborhoods all the time here.

t1_duxcqgu	-0.296000	*	Will the execute every woman?    
t1_dv2gpox	-0.340000	*	Cause we have no corruption now? Term limits stops a few from gaining power to kill any other bill or discussion while leading to the same old bullshit. 
t1_dundy7s	0.458800	*	the fuck are you on about
t1_duhdtdh	0.000000	*	Not really. Whatever you come up with is going to have to have *some* kind of longish bit of narrow flexible tubing, and somebody's going to stick their mouth on that. 
t1_dujdmjl	0.000000	*	It causes articles like the one OP posted and makes them look bad?  They probably didn't do it for that reason, it's more of a side-effect...
t1_duzuysp	0.612400	*	The farmers don't do shit down there.  The workers do, and that's who will be left on the land.    Edit:  loving the downvotes from white Americans.  Ya'll ignant.

t1_dv4tg06	-0.942200	*	So nobody has died from poor labour conditions during construction of stadia? No passports were withheld from workers, preventing them from returning home? Alright bud..
t1_dui4z5r	0.000000	*	It's also an issue that we do not have more tax brackets. Yes, someone making $500k/year is well off, but they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year. 
t1_due8fjk	0.624900	*	Hmm, my last trip last year  was definately a different one compared to 2002 when i went there. I didnt like it this time

t1_duehfq1	0.000000	*	So you say while white and black americans fight each other over a movie.  There is lots of racisn in multicultural societys. Probably more so than in homogenic ones.
t1_dumcwrz	-0.476700	*	Because hes a hardliner on negotiating with terrorists. He refuses to. 
t1_dv4tnn2	-0.700300	*	The Rapture happened between 1914 and 1945.  We're all the ones that are left behind.
t1_dv2ivj3	0.250000	*	That or we should fully treat them like people. Charge them for social security, require them to register for the draft, put the company in prison for committing crimes instead of fining them....

t1_dv40tdp	0.000000	*	Well Im not lol Im vegetarian so... 
t1_dv0nsfk	0.000000	*	How enlightened.   Maybe we should teach children how the world actually is.
t1_dupvgnf	0.000000	*	Well, the Bible's god isn't exactly a very loving deity from all the stories I've read. He'd definitely let people do whatever.
t1_duk7tgg	0.000000	*	1032 trees per minute....  How? 
t1_dugtys9	0.913200	*	I dont like Trump much, but you do know hela is a highly intelligent and well educated person? Right?
t1_dullrie	0.000000	*	Of course not. They don't call them no-go zones, they call them especially vulnerable areas.
t1_dulk41u	0.000000	*	It says so in the EU charter they signed on joining the EU, get the benefits, deal with the tough stuff.

t1_duk6ymm	0.401900	*	I actually had a gay housemate, that man was immaculate. He would not be seen out of his room unless he was 110% fabulous, any stains were caught well before stepping out haha
t1_duoj294	-0.717800	*	The Yakuza might have something to say about that. They like removing fingers I hear.
t1_dv2nafy	0.000000	*	I've seen him on the italian news literally 1 hour ago, he's still very influential   https://youtu.be/PsJFXU2jHTw  I don't even know what to say at this point

t1_duq6en9	-0.700300	*	The max sentence on it is 5 years and $250,000. It is objectively lax, I think it should include revocation of citizenship.
t1_dv14olh	0.000000	*	It's called ethics.
t1_dv18tew	0.000000	*	Those links are about the UN troops in Haiti years ago. OP's article is about current UN aid workers in Syria. 
t1_duu9zr8	-0.747500	*	Hammerhead...whales? Do you mean sharks?
t1_dufsbsl	0.360300	*	It wasn't thirteen guys with a twitter. You are either lying or just did not bother to read the news.
t1_dv0pwml	-0.659700	*	I can't think of *anything* positive that America is #1 in. 
t1_dusxkai	0.482400	*	China was never a democracy. All this development means is the dictatorship has become more official. 
t1_dusx2d1	0.077200	*	We're rare as North Koreans around these parts
t1_duhjsaw	0.000000	*	These arent British people doing it theyre usually African or Caribbean immigrants.

t1_duxa2ox	-0.877900	*	And then they held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days....so fuck Iran
t1_durk2je	0.000000	*	Just sell it in the produce section next to the basil
t1_dui3tq4	0.810500	*	Sure, but public perception is extremely important nonetheless and Singapore's public transport is already well developed 
t1_dv011ps	0.421500	*	But these ones are white, so I'm guessing we will see yet another round of hypocrisy from this administration.
t1_duslqwv	0.877800	*	That had me absolutely howling.  'Worn out baseball glove tightly gripping a turd' is the finest insult since 'your mom'. 
t1_dxx1o2a	-0.557400	*	The court should have no say in whether the parents can continue his treatment elsewhere though.
t1_duqil18	0.025800	*	28xd7.80 (federal offense) = 22.4 years at least if that is what he was sentenced
t1_dummoed	0.000000	*	Wow blowing my mind. What if modern French were ancient brits and modern brits are actually ancient french.   My stereotypes are ruined!
t1_dugp1e6	0.000000	*	They mean there's no precedent of Trump acknowledging that Russia did anything. Now he says they did, but he wasn't involved. Before he said there was nothing there at all.
t1_dun16ij	0.000000	*	Theres a difference between doesnt like and is meddling in our elections
t1_duzumx4	0.000000	*	Yes, because only white people can farm /s. Seriously though it's a decolonization program.   
t1_dulo9zi	0.953100	*	How come in America everyone goes ape shit every four years about whos in the White House but they dont care about people being in Congress for 30-40 years? 
t1_duolo5n	0.000000	*	>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  I see your supplier is doing just fine!

t1_dujdmjl	-0.690800	*	It causes articles like the one OP posted and makes them look bad?  They probably didn't do it for that reason, it's more of a side-effect...
t1_dv3z507	0.439100	*	Essentially.
t1_dutyw81	0.000000	*	Wait have you even looked at the differences between S and N Korea?  One has kpop and Samsung.  The other has slavery and starvation.  What exactly are you defending? 
t1_dusd95t	0.000000	*	Not sure, but I think I saw something the last couple of days about Mexico being in talks with Brazil to buy corn from them instead of from the U.S..
t1_dudt50r	0.000000	*	It's 21 out of 1. Not 21 out of 100.
t1_dur4qb9	-0.728700	*	They took to the streets, millions strong.   They don't have guns though, so after some very one way violent clashes with police, that ended because people don't like getting shot. 
t1_dummt5g	-0.726900	*	GP was saying that's bad for other countries, not for America. Pretty debatable, however, and also pretty shitty from an individual person's perspective.
t1_dum0gy5	0.585900	*	That's a major reason far-right parties in Israel have such power, a categorical refusal by centrist parties to include the Arab parties in any government turns the far right into King-makers.
t1_dud0wvy	0.000000	*	Big nothing shitshow to keep idiots amused. Hope you enjoyed the program. The bill is in the mail.
t1_duylm36	0.000000	*	Sure thing, buddy. Mueller would be hunting school shooters if not for the fake witch hunt.  The talking points you people get these days are really pathetic. 
t1_dv4aem2	0.902200	*	Did you see scaramucci in the last two days on CNN, he said the swamp might be a gold-plated hot tub that is impossible to drain... i don't know what the fuck he meant by that exactly
t1_dufgvg1	0.000000	*	Yeah, because all those elections where one side wins by a whopping 98% are statistically plausible. People fall for propaganda so easily 
t1_dv2jpmq	0.414500	*	Would it though? I mean I'm not sure I want Pence as the president...
t1_duv5clf	0.883200	*	Found a Russian troll!
t1_duhwe1i	0.424500	*	>here in europe we don't find NK a threat at all.  Well Europe hasn't got two allies and it's territory under threat from North Korean nuclear weapons.    
t1_duozdf9	0.458800	*	Fascism is just a different political ideology now. Just like ISIS.
t1_ducfv9r	-0.296000	*	Rogers is the worst. Every night for the last three years, at exactly 3:00AM, my Internet slows down significantly, same thing with a few of my neighbors who're with Rogers.
t1_dum8fcc	-0.773200	*	Sounds like a great plan. Wish we could adopt that in the US.
t1_dua5g9n	0.202300	*	Yeah file those under casual school firearm use. It unfairly makes us look bad.
t1_dumbalk	0.822100	*	You dismissed his first argument without actually addressing it.
t1_duq5wu8	-0.846400	*	> much of the western world into chaos..  That may be a bit much. 'The West' is quite a bit larger than the US and the UK..
t1_dufnzxg	0.868900	*	I'm pretty sure the big red siren blaring FOX NEWS ALERT is always going off. 
t1_duijz68	-0.510600	*	Are you confusing what I wrote with what I think, or with what you think?   In genetic tests, one should only say the name of the gene, not use old 20th century names. 
t1_dut31ew	0.571900	*	What's a good source of info about CCP politics? Seems more interesting than what we have in the west.

t1_duztaof	-0.557400	*	> This sort of tribal and revenge filled motivation that belongs in the middle ages.   Sort of like an invasion of Iraq because some completely different Arabs did a terror attack?
t1_dur4etn	-0.340000	*	Destroying the Constitution is common decency?
t1_duzvcyv	0.000000	*	Yeah that's not true at all. Didn't Reagan invade Grenada just to flex? What's keeping developing (should be called over-exploited) and undeveloped nations down is globalization from the Global North
t1_duoqi6l	-0.421500	*	lol antifa are just as bad as the fascists they claim to fight. They're two sides of the same extreme coin.
t1_duednvc	0.838500	*	The sustainability is arguable, depending on your timeline. The necessity is absolute, at least from an economic standpoint.  Growth is a net positive for society. 
t1_duzzx18	-0.242000	*	oh good, lets compound the problem.
t1_dusf7ao	-0.528700	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is never going to be built and even if it were there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it, no matter what he says. 
t1_duqfwbw	-0.420100	*	Puts the b in subtle.
t1_dv2pwy8	0.153000	*	Stop crying on your keyboards and get people out to vote then.

t1_duz3o6s	0.612400	*	In US almost everything runs on petrol, trucks included, so it's definitely possible.
t1_dummk1i	0.000000	*	That teacher is far more likely to kill an innocent bystander than the gunman. Think about that.
t1_duzf2c6	-0.807900	*	Yeah Obama was native Kenyan too!
t1_dua39zu	0.284900	*	Right, you can't take away handguns or rifles so the best 'dumb logic' solution is to give guns to people to protect themselves. 
t1_duhxjp7	0.000000	*	Citation needed. 
t1_duopo51	0.000000	*	*Bang*  It's just been revoked.
t1_duizh9r	0.624000	*	I always viewed religion as a legacy operating system for humans. Basically we still have people trying to run Windows 3.11 on new hardware. 
t1_duukq8v	0.000000	*	That's... not fascist? Not every authoritarian is a fascist.
t1_dv48gl7	-0.824000	*	Pretty good analogy honestly. Like paying for the toll road and it's still slow as shit. lol
t1_duzayss	-0.077200	*	>in  You have bee baed from /r/Chia.

t1_dubl8ie	-0.502300	*	Even if that is true, do you really think that isn't the case? You are truly naive if you think only the 'evil puppet master Russians' are using bots
t1_dud66il	0.310200	*	Example?
t1_dujut1m	0.077200	*	That's just how they want you to dance and you think it's an independent thought. That's the state of political warfare
t1_duxk91e	-0.735100	*	Not many people would recognize Academi as still Erik Prince 
t1_dun0rw5	0.000000	*	$1.2 billion in dressing a turd and its still a turd.   Id argue the MSM pretending she wasnt corrupt had more of an effect in redpilling BernieBros like me into switching sides.

t1_duyaoxn	0.524000	*	What kind of hunting?

t1_dv03swq	0.025800	*	But that 8% is vastly more wealthy and armed. How do you think Apartheid worked in the first place?

t1_dv3025v	0.000000	*	A Kossack is someone who subscribes to the daily Kos. Left wing news website, lots of petitions, organization for political action.
t1_duq4q8y	-0.916800	*	Because it oversimplifies an extremely complex issue to the point where it feels disingenuous. 
t1_dud45qg	0.289600	*	This is where I am lost - by what actual means can we say their story is bullshit and ours isnt?  How can we be certain our side isnt making up claims just as theirs is? Legit question.

t1_dul9gub	0.656500	*	I don't see why not!
t1_dv3kkoa	-0.421500	*	These are all heavily upvoted
t1_dui4z5r	-0.564200	*	It's also an issue that we do not have more tax brackets. Yes, someone making $500k/year is well off, but they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year. 
t1_dui3w65	0.902000	*	That's what Piketty recommended in his Nobel winning economics book.

t1_dv3n2lu	0.000000	*	Democrats can't take 2/3rds of the Senate, if McConnell wants him gone, he will be gone. However Trump is more popular with the base than Republicans in the senate are so they won't do it.

t1_dufodth	-0.296000	*	I was curious so looked it up: Each day, there are 3400 deaths in traffic worldwide. 3400!! One person killed every 25 seconds.  93 deaths a day in the US alone.

t1_dunl37z	0.000000	*	Not anymore, bud. It's morphed into being about each and every little aspect of men's behaviour. Who could've predicted *that*? /s

t1_duvlp6i	0.000000	*	Apparently even acknowledging the problem is a big step for some. But besides that, polluting less would be good.
t1_dunywq8	0.000000	*	What does that have to do with this? Does that previous situation change the current one we're seeing in Syria? Pretty sure, and I hate to say it, this is the definition of whataboutism. 
t1_durcmoe	-0.988300	*	More horrific than anything in WW2  The Eastern front and Chinese front were worse in terms of civilian loss. Allied civilian losses outnumber Axis losses by millions.

t1_duzk9pd	0.000000	*	No, They are right. The Gulf stream of warm water flowing along North american East coast across the Atlantic to Western Europe has great influence on creating a more mild climate in the area.

t1_duatnvk	0.000000	*	How about the same reason as everyone else does it, to make money? Do you honestly think that the ONLY way to get snow cleared in Moscow is to write Navalny's name on it?
t1_due6ilb	-0.421500	*	The goal is to have all that money stored up so when the economy blows and everything is super cheap you could just buy everything up and be in control and have all the stuff!
t1_dujo641	-0.897400	*	Lol youre delusional. The reason executives and CEOs make more money than you or the average pleb is because theyre better and smarter than you, plain and simple.

t1_dui1edm	0.000000	*	Exactly this, our best economic years occurred when we had much much  higher taxes. Claiming that raising taxes on the super rich is bad for the economy is just ignoring all the data.

t1_duf5mgh	0.000000	*	FWIW its not how America really is. Its just the internet. Most people just feel mildly about it all.

t1_duj7let	-0.939800	*	What is your point? That it's not a crime? That it shouldn't be punished? 
t1_dugsw2t	0.570900	*	The fact that his investigation is leak free is amazing. Meanwhile Trump's whitehouse has a water main break.
t1_duohhm6	0.421500	*	Not to mention that Trump would pretty much be admitting guilt himself if he did so
t1_dug0npv	0.025800	*	That's fair.  The point I'm trying (badly) to make is that he is going to forfeit his medal for using a performance enhancing drugs that doesn't actually enhance his performance.

t1_dulcdb8	-0.928100	*	He got downvoted because it is nowhere near the same level nor would it ever be possible to do so at the same level in the modern world.
t1_duu9ryh	-0.872700	*	The most surprising thing in this comment is that Mexico had at least one war with France, possibly more.

t1_duns7ww	0.051600	*	Yeah I think people forget that many countries have a travel ban list. Its an issue I never really understood all the outrage against it. 
t1_dv24amj	0.439100	*	France seems to have collectively lost their minds. Provided it wasn't fake news, they're looking at imprisoning a political leader for bad decorum?   I guess those tweets didn't go over as planned.

t1_dv3p9qt	0.000000	*	What does that mean? I mean what could we seriously do to Russia? lol
t1_duybogz	-0.585900	*	Removing people from the voter rolls is every bit as bad as casting fake votes or changing votes... 
t1_dugp5v1	0.000000	*	We actually won by three million votes. I think it's important to always point that out.  Edit: Holy crap. I either struck a nerve or the Russians are online in full force tonight.  SAD!

t1_dv4qv6r	-0.755000	*	That would usually be considered a counter offensive which is actually defensive in nature.
t1_duhvcjq	0.401900	*	I still wouldn't Tibet on it. 
t1_dubv6ht	-0.493900	*	That is also a cost thing  Probably cost less to hire 1,000 men than 10 excavators

t1_dusf7ao	-0.868900	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is never going to be built and even if it were there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it, no matter what he says.

t1_duuv837	0.000000	*	Different president with a different mystic shaman?  Or do they still use the same shamans as recommended by the Chaebols?      
t1_dv4eshv	-0.104500	*	>Northern Irish catholic  Forgive us for what? For retaliating after innocent women and children got blown up as an attempt to force a UI down our throats? Seems legit.

t1_duq6oz7	0.493900	*	As an older redditor, I wouldn't. The odds that you could ever recover from that loss of integrity are slim.  It's one of the reasons why T_D is the horrorshow of a cesspool that it is.

t1_dv4u81q	0.421500	*	Who are you and what do you do in  the real world?  I only ask because you leave wonderfully detailed replies like this. Do you have them saved and ready to go?  Amazing.

t1_duzwzbb	-0.340000	*	If only this was actually seen and considered by all the herp-derps in the thread, instead of just solidifying their victim mentality.  Sigh.

t1_duj831z	0.025800	*	On Reddit it doesnt. Hence the comment about Reddit.  I dont read comments before I try and come up with condescending reply because thats the only joy I get out of life.
t1_dunjtej	-0.296000	*	After School is gross. It literally encourages underage kids and teens to be sexy with each other, it makes me want to throw up. How is it not illegal?

t1_duq81g4	-0.071500	*	It'd require a constitutional amendment, unfortunately. The constitution and legal precedent make it pretty clear CU is inevitable based on a basic reading of our bill of rights.

t1_ducr12n	-0.051600	*	No. That would be the countless investigations into the Clintons where conservatives came up short over and over again, but succeed in painting her as just as bad as Trump.

t1_dupaz4y	0.447900	*	Link to these studies? I know the fear response (physiological stress response) is lower with repeated exposure. That comes from being desensitized, which is not necessarily a good thing...

t1_duq7jbj	-0.889800	*	I get the point, but I would hope so. Relatively, potential collusion among world superpowers is a few notches above one school shooter, even though what Cruz did was horrible.

t1_dui4ecj	-0.102700	*	Maybe punishment was a poor word choice. Does it not feel unfair to tax rich  people substantially more? They have  more money yes but they earned it.
t1_duu3u9n	0.077200	*	I don't think guns attract violence, I think the people who are scared of guns are the thieves, people who know they might be put in harm's way.

t1_duyqcmp	0.646800	*	You seem more concerned with the *idea* that Russia attempted to undermine the election than with things that actually harm our democracy.

t1_dudc5vl	0.000000	*	>  delegitimize Trump's presidency.  It says the bots also supported Sanders. By your logic, it would also delegitimise any success Sanders had, too.

t1_dur729p	-0.875800	*	You should come to Germany, I'm certainly proud of our culture around remembering German war crimes. The level of self awareness is an example other countries should take note of.
t1_dusf7ao	-0.887100	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is never going to be built and even if it were there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it, no matter what he says.

t1_dv0mjgr	-0.715300	*	Oh yeah, Russia is absolutely convinced that doing the same thing somehow will yield different result this time around. Delusional.

t1_duqzru2	0.296000	*	Rich foundations helping a country can often be a bad thing, the real problem is people jumping to conclusions.

t1_dues9lb	0.526700	*	Sure. But I tend to think the country with freedom of speech, genuine democratic elections and an independent judiciary has a better case for it than the dictatorship run by ex-KGB kleptocrats.

t1_dum8y20	-0.932600	*	It's not shoehorned at all. It's pointing out that it isn't a conservative twitter issue as implied by the headline, but a twitter issue. It applies to all users, not just some political subset.
t1_duvlp6i	-0.633300	*	Apparently even acknowledging the problem is a big step for some. But besides that, polluting less would be good.

t1_dujgw32	-0.978000	*	No the man is an asshole who lies to make himself feel better. It is an ego thing, and not something I pity him for.

t1_dv44acp	0.273200	*	Ukraine is in Europe, Transdniestria (however you spell that) is in Europe. The Baltic countries are in Europe.

t1_dv0huye	-0.541300	*	Honestly, I'm loving it. It's pretty fun to watch this all unfold. I don't know why people are always complaining about the Cold War as it was a scary kind of thing or something to be worried about.
t1_duruoat	0.000000	*	These peoples lives involve more than just billionaires and hyperbolic statements 
t1_dupao4i	0.273200	*	Sure, but they aren't using it to direct tiny robots on how to laser your eyes. That's the part that bothers me, personally. You shouldn't perform eye surgery by yourself.
t1_duj73v2	0.851900	*	I don't care if they are. Unless they actually have evidence that they believe will put them in jail I am sick of hearing about Mueller 'finding something' to keep the clicks going.
t1_duwi96i	-0.790600	*	So this would be a way to punish the spouse and children for something their partner did by tearing the family apart without trial or even a need to prove any wrongdoing?

t1_duhyito	0.880700	*	As you say it isn't perfect, so why not make some changes?  Pharma isn't the only industry that has patents, yet they still try to prevent monopolies in other industries.
t1_duogbb9	-0.296000	*	Yeah but discrimination during apartheid was pretty clear. It didn't spare black immigrants. Only white immigrants were spared and everyone else was made to live as second or third class citizens.

t1_duu9k79	0.000000	*	French bakers really know how to bring the pain.
t1_dupwjdi	-0.727300	*	You don't get it. 108 convictions should automatically be life in prison without the possibility of parole. Therapy is optional. If you're cured, great, but you still aren't getting out.

t1_dutpcx0	-0.526700	*	Explain to me how you think a system that takes in the opinions of its citizens is more flawed than a system which relies on the opinion of a single person? Don't you see the flaw in that logic?

t1_dupe5hz	-0.067600	*	I mean we respect soldiers the same as we respect other jobs and we respect them as people- it's nowhere near the type of explicit hero worship the US sees as respecting their soldiers for example
t1_duxwzrg	0.000000	*	To make their life hard. 
t1_dudre9k	0.648600	*	Code word leftist, ergo I am baiting someone with this comment and therefor any reply will then follow a flow chart.

t1_duwgoti	0.855000	*	Makes you wonder how accurately they checked the sources of EVERYTHING else on that report. Because it pretty much looks like the searched for war videos on youtube.
t1_duqmzou	-0.318700	*	Maybe detain the clearly dangerous lunatic after receiving multiple tips and calls?  Just anything other than disregard the problem.  
t1_duk8fk6	0.000000	*	Interfere and meddle is not the same thing. Interefere implies that they succeeded and as Rosenstein made clear, there is still nothing pointing to the fact that they did succeed.

t1_dukqf2u	0.347900	*	That's terrible advertising if you ever want to get more trolls. Gonna run out of trolls at that rate. (I mean, seems like a bad deal.)
t1_due8whn	-0.475400	*	That short list still leaves a massive amount of very nice resort towns. Enough for several lifetimes.

t1_dubhr7f	0.457600	*	Isn't that also all of humanity? Billions of self-important assholes convinced of our own providence  Edit: I hope this doesn't come off as snotty, I'm dealing with mono and am just feeling shitty.
t1_duitdad	0.493900	*	Yeah, it looks actually quite far. Guess it wouldnt be as feasible as I thought originally.
t1_dusf7ao	0.000000	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is never going to be built and even if it were there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it, no matter what he says. 
t1_dv1h650	0.648600	*	Wanna go out on a limb and take a gander as to who this guy votes for too?  It frightens me that a good portion of our populace is this way. Downright frightening. 
t1_duo5hrc	-0.850500	*	So they can also be bombed to death
t1_duz4ejo	0.526700	*	The 3 felonies a day theory has some merit in the US. That we all commit 3 felonies daily, because there are so many laws on the books its impossible not to. We just dont know we do.

t1_durs4ad	-0.051600	*	>You have no where to run to.  You can choose to not watch it..  I know, that's asking a lot in our current outrage culture. It's just so much easier to turn into a pissy bitch.

t1_dv36mmh	-0.599400	*	Can you post on it?  Yes you can.  If you have an internet connection you can post on it.  Nothing is stopping you.  If you get banned just make a new account.
t1_duau9o3	-0.264000	*	It is tiring how every world news article that may be slightly negative towards Russia is constantly countered with b-b-but the USA! 
t1_duuyinb	0.600300	*	Three. It requires parties to work together for things to get done.  Edit: changed the number to a word because Reddit doesn't know what numbers are.

t1_dv2kgk4	-0.296000	*	Yeah, because becoming more like the US is totally something Denmark should work towards. 
t1_duo160e	0.000000	*	Violent crime has been steadily decreasing in the US for years.. so that wouldnt quite match up with your idea that religion is some how the cure to violence.
t1_dv0dvj3	0.000000	*	The Ireland 2040 adverts? 
t1_duje4bz	0.261700	*	What? When the army doesn't have enough equipment then you can't decrease spending.  An EU army won't be a solution, if everyone reduces their spending. 
t1_duq7s1m	0.000000	*	Don't worry, next year they'll find a new country to blame.

t1_dugc6ly	-0.671200	*	>  Israel will turn around and tell everyone else they need to take in refugees.  That would be rather surprising. That doesn't happen, AFAIK
t1_dushisi	0.921800	*	You think Trump will quit? I dont know his history of failures very well, but I dont see him backing down even for his own good.
t1_duedk82	0.000000	*	Racism and isolationism aren't the same thing. Lots of countries have race problems and are uncomfortable with immigrants, but cent isolated themselves to the point that their economy has stagnated.

t1_dupaz4y	-0.579600	*	Link to these studies? I know the fear response (physiological stress response) is lower with repeated exposure. That comes from being desensitized, which is not necessarily a good thing...

t1_dv64s8w	0.296000	*	I think Obama massively recovered the US's reputation across the globe. Everyone I know in the UK thought he seemed like an ideal leader.

t1_dultzdo	-0.826800	*	Exactly. It's always fun to see the US propaganda on Reddit, it's so biased. People are so prone to judge other countries/leaders.

t1_duwiach	0.187700	*	Tbh shit like this makes me catch myself getting more and more racist and generally anti-Muslim/Anti-immigration. I've gradually drifted from just left of the centre, futher and further right.

t1_duigu11	0.762200	*	Well then, let's open immigration to African Christians. There's tons of them.  No, I maintain it's not about religion, just disguised racism.

t1_dv8nzvf	-0.636900	*	I can't agree with the means in that case but the end is justified. Even if it's accidental, hurting the state-sponsored terrorism industry is always a good thing.

t1_dv109k6	-0.296000	*	I think that is a misconception, maybe through bad translation: She said somebody had to call no-go zones no-go zones. Not that someone should say 'So you can't go here, here and here'.

t1_dufnsaa	-0.687200	*	If there were as many planes as there are cars, planes would be more dangerous.  This argument (aka the famous vending machines more dangerous than sharks) is shit.

t1_dupjgib	0.440400	*	You are correct - I already feel stupid for wording it like this. Guess I will have to take the backlash now.

t1_duras7t	0.421500	*	It sounds like you and u/flaminghippy are saying that Howard was a Conservative? 
t1_durc20v	-0.599400	*	I take it you're a Pearl Harbor denier.  As in you deny recognition of December 7th.  By this logic you deny recognition of MLKs death, because imperial institutionalized racism no longer exists.

t1_duod49u	0.297000	*	Glad I know the PM of Denmark thinks kids shouldnt be slaughtered in school.  Whats the PMs opinion on the Broward County sheriff and FBI not investigating this piece of shit who shot up the school?

t1_duxnnnl	-0.476700	*	No reason for anyone to take that the wrong way. Youre exactly right. Its the same reason whistleblowers are blacklisted. This person cant accept the status quo, dont hire them.

t1_dui4z5r	0.000000	*	It's also an issue that we do not have more tax brackets. Yes, someone making $500k/year is well off, but they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year. 
t1_duremyg	0.340000	*	Depends on what you mean by cheap.  It only has to cost as what you get from dealer - tax included.  You wont go for illegal stuff for the same price if you can buy it legally.

t1_dum220e	0.000000	*	This is why the US cant tamper in Russia, they don't allow their people to actually make decisions.   I'll take a shit show like the 2016 election instead of a total lack of freedom any day.

t1_dupkqg6	0.381800	*	The US flag was apparently ran up as they approached the base. I have to think they either thought that was a bluff or were hoping that the US wouldn't dare return fire against Russian forces.

t1_dups0sb	-0.755000	*	Remember how Benghazi was such a huge deal because of the loss of American life that we had to investigate Clinton for years?  Why isn't Russia hiring mercenaries to kill American troops a big deal?

t1_dumrztz	0.000000	*	Regardless, this is the direction that will be taken. How much do you want to bet there becomes a mysterious trend of unarmed black students being shot by white teachers? 
t1_dv0mafd	-0.754400	*	Hmm. Depends on the vote, first, and then sometimes it may be up to countries to make it real or not. Some of the EU regulations can be enforced, some others are guidance.

t1_duc8gnp	0.000000	*	Yes. The west has been fucking around in Afghanistan since the 1800's. Worse still, those have all been proxy wars. Afghanistan had it's unfair due.

t1_duh1s62	0.000000	*	Didn't you hear? Americans are dreamers too ;-)
t1_dujsnem	0.000000	*	Denial of coverage is one thing, this is the government flat out deciding that his life isn't worth the anything and effectively acting as an executioner to this poor child. 
t1_duqabb1	0.318200	*	And if it all helped the Dems then they would do the same. China fought like mad for Hillary but we dont talk about that. 
t1_duu9yao	0.000000	*	But why are the Myanmar Buddhists doing this? Is it because they fear a growing Islamic presence? Because they're aware of how minority Buddhists communities are treated in majority Muslim countries?

t1_dv1ins1	0.000000	*	The US actually sucks at trade wars too because its so easy to target individual states to threaten the governments chance to be re-elected. See Bush's tarrifs and the Eu threatened Florida. 
t1_duphshg	0.000000	*	When someone calls others culturally incompatible it's a clear sign they are inflexible and close-minded.  It's the kind of BS some Americans said about Irish immigrants in the late 1800's.

t1_dupfump	-0.636900	*	You think vote manipulation by the bots wouldn't push some of them to the top?
t1_dupiu4l	0.000000	*	Oh I'm not only partisan, I'm a veteran as well.
t1_duus1qm	0.000000	*	Then put the armed addicts in schools and the addicts can protect the kids from mass shootings (saves having to train the well paid teachers).
t1_dv38asg	-0.296000	*	Yeah, go look at the post histories of all these people saying /R/POLITICS IS THE SAME. It's all the same types of subs and they are all saying the same thing at the same time. 
t1_duch4ez	0.000000	*	I think you are going to be sorely disappointed... 
t1_dv00kg5	0.827100	*	As a white person, i can tell you my life has been anything but privileged. Everything I have I had to earn. 
t1_dupgipe	0.880500	*	There is actually nothing wrong with mixing a little bit socialism into a system that otherwise is free market/capitalism. The result is the best possible system. Full stop. 
t1_dv63pj9	-0.718400	*	I never said anything about price 
t1_duki7gt	0.000000	*	Years of heavy drinking.
t1_dubhhut	0.865600	*	Thank You for your measured, sobering comment. But I think most people are in the 'anyone but Putin' camp at this point, despite the danger this poses, as per your comment. 
t1_dukihsa	0.234900	*	No, I did read it. What do you think I missed?
t1_dubm3l8	-0.626900	*	Bro, it is not gun control issue, bro.
t1_dui5r4h	0.254200	*	Because it basically turns into a competition of which nation can open their legs more than the others.  They are making us fight against each other while they reap exorbitant gains for that. 
t1_dudodkv	0.000000	*	Wouldn't have mattered. Spanish priests burned native central American libraries as affronts to the Catholic Church. Only a handful of codices remain.
t1_dua7pej	-0.296000	*	So people who kill in the name of Islam are not terrorists?  What do we call them now? Crusaders?
t1_duyhwkk	0.000000	*	Protip: forgetting instances where to be verb would fit is the mark of Russians who are still not fully fluent at English.
t1_duayffn	0.458800	*	Congrats on entering the 18th century
t1_dua4l1w	-0.659700	*	Im a fan of several of their heavy handed methods beyond disease containment tbh, even if not all.  
t1_dv2mu3i	-0.347700	*	It blows me away how fast the US has lost it's role as a leader. They went from a respected super power to a joke on par with NK.
t1_dugdz3y	-0.318200	*	If Trump was caught spying on Merkel Europe would lose it's mind
t1_duyiek4	0.000000	*	She gets a pass for mishandling classified info and destroying the devices which were the evidence. Because it was her TURRRRNNNNN

t1_dud5ytb	-0.476700	*	Announced to americans.  He probably told the russians in 2012:  http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4810:y865yw.2.33
t1_dug87de	0.308900	*	Just because it's worse somewhere else does NOT mean there isn't a fucking problem HERE. God damn, the cognitive dissonance is un fucking real.
t1_dv2ekmr	0.000000	*	are you really living tho?

t1_duetcae	0.000000	*	That was just off the top of my head. If you think they've gotten better then you're a fool.

t1_duyxgxu	-0.401900	*	I was detained and searched at U.S. Customs for no fucking reason and I'm a canadian citizen. Many people have been having those issues too. Where's the outcry about it?
t1_duzxa2a	0.421500	*	Land appropriations in Zimbabwe caused the entire population to become trillionaires. Surely this can only ever be interpreted as a wildly successful program.  /s
t1_duq74f6	-0.778300	*	Ah that explains why most rape cases in the study was over 20 years ago
t1_dujimn1	-0.891900	*	Couldnt the exact same be said in regards to the left and their desire to gut the entire constitution?  From speech to guns go illegal immigrants....
t1_dui7hr1	0.718400	*	How on earth would that even work? What incentives would other nations have to go along with that?
t1_duz1lxf	0.000000	*	Unless it is different in other countries personal gifts are not allowed so only party donations is possible.
t1_dusi321	0.735100	*	India And China had war in recent memory.  Great time to be alive.  
t1_dv2dljg	0.000000	*	As a former Peace Corps volunteer, the less Trump knows about the agency, the better.   Im guessing he still doesnt know about the agency, because he actually nominated a competent person to run it. 
t1_dudtgo7	-0.476700	*	Lol. Your an idiot. 
t1_dv489mn	0.571900	*	I live in rural Australia, I pay $50 for 10GB a month.  When I download a game I have to incorporate the file size in the price. Just typing this comment was expensive.  EDIT: Clarity.
t1_dv2o4o1	0.000000	*	Actually if that many penguins started migrating to  somewhere unexpected I would say it is indeed due to global warming(or climate change).
t1_duqgzvr	0.000000	*	Well, when the boss only drinks diet coke and you're the coffee boy you've kind of already made some bad career decisions.  Treason is pretty much the only move you have left...
t1_duwm3q1	0.855500	*	That's upsetting.  Don't give me a raise  *Fine! We'll sue you for all you are worth!*
t1_dub5uy9	-0.829600	*	Pointing out what Russian bots are doing is not blaming them for what happened.
t1_dv2jpe3	0.735100	*	The finest vegan diet?  Why not the shittiest vegan diet?
t1_dv45y98	0.715200	*	Nobody wins in a trade war.
t1_duhmz3j	0.476700	*	moreover, sea ice melting is supposed to reduce, not increase, the total sea level since water is more dense than ice
t1_duckvux	-0.526700	*	It means I was sarcastic lol
t1_duq5hqk	-0.488500	*	From what it seems the reports suggest that actually Germany needs more immigrants to continue with its economic growth due to declining population.
t1_dumgstb	-0.476700	*	There's a really interesting Tedx talk that touches on why people seem to care less about boys dieing:   https://youtu.be/Qi1oN1icAYc 
t1_duokrnw	0.361200	*	But that doesn't change that mass shootings and murder in general is very high in USA compared to other western countries. 
t1_ducpvmn	0.000000	*	Why would he be impeached?
t1_duxkt6q	0.000000	*	Because fuck Russia.

t1_duuiwft	0.000000	*	Those Chinese boats are a part of the PLAN, ramming is just one of their tactics.
t1_dujxqz5	-0.585900	*	Sure. I think it should be based on the pulse rate. So it wouldn't matter exactly which machine you used. You could even jog. 
t1_dui8upe	-0.386200	*	It is illegal but this is happening on a grand scale, both individuals and coorperations. Its one of the reasons the uber wealthy are hiding over 30 trillion off shore. 
t1_duug5d2	0.362600	*	No Doomsday cult worship there, they don't go for inspiration or shit, btw what kind of inspiration you get from seeing a empty chamber lol.  >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Fire 
t1_duldpqr	0.636900	*	Terroristapologism
t1_duq5zk8	-0.128000	*	The NRA now just spreads fear in order to get people to buy more guns and make more money. Their platform takes advantage of the uninformed and uneducated to further their own interests. 
t1_dv35299	0.000000	*	So these two raven species aren't producing fecund offspring? 
t1_duynzp4	0.458800	*	I don't doubt you, but do you have a source we can reference?
t1_duf5hp6	-0.659700	*	The entirety if what is going on in the middle East caused by us / Soviet interests.  Good ole US, do as I say not as I do. Seriously, fuck our government.
t1_duc2sb7	-0.051600	*	Like I said:   > Sterile wipe, poke, bandaid, through away needle, repeat?  Honest question: am I missing something?
t1_durcur6	-0.860600	*	Read up on the rape of Nanking, oh giant adult. The nukes stopped Japan, parading their victims is unacceptable until Japan accepts responsibility for their war crimes. 
t1_dv3qe0f	0.000000	*	5 years wtf lmao
t1_dubzgx4	0.000000	*	Any country with a standing military can order them to plant trees tbf but well done China for having the initiative to go do it. 
t1_dufye3k	0.000000	*	It's a brief snip and it looks more appealing than the way it looks normally. Everyone in this thread are so angry.
t1_dusd9s6	0.836000	*	Typical US army worship. You realise the US isn't the only country with an army right? 
t1_dumlw4l	-0.151300	*	It wouldn't stop it, most of the kids who go in these are confirmed to be or have been suicidal, a lot of them taking their own lives.  It's time to stop going after the symptom and cure the disease.
t1_dug2ul9	-0.863300	*	> cross on foot  between Jordan and Israel man that's a wild imagination you got there.
t1_ducbxcn	0.669600	*	Oh the things i would do for some sweet gold
t1_durrbcu	0.082300	*	What the fuck, this is bull shit lmao.

t1_dv0ipb2	0.600300	*	How are all your nukes feeding you? GDP isn't doing so hot either but army is important. Looks like the next North Korea.
t1_duod97t	0.165500	*	It's funny though you rarely hear this in the western media, but almost constantly hear about the ecological damage of China and the Chinese.  
t1_dutmxbk	0.473800	*	In Rome, the obligatory ones are free, but that's only like five vaccines, and the rest have varying costs. In Sicily, they're nearly all free. So for my kids, summer vacation means free vaccines.
t1_dv3a6uf	-0.739700	*	Genuinely sounds like a new copypasta, Christ.
t1_duzrpup	0.000000	*	God damn, that's terrifying.
t1_dv00tm7	0.639000	*	> We rarely if ever saw another human the entire time.  Talk to me about the bugs.  With wings.  The bugs with wings. 
t1_duvyn0x	0.000000	*	You are too optimistic. We will live till the 2070s and 2080s. So many opportunities for humanity to fuck it up further. 
t1_duwbvih	0.000000	*	Next you're gunna tell me the world is round?
t1_duqpcim	-0.653400	*	What do you think the implications are?
t1_duguiue	0.340000	*	You can educate them but how do you get them to apply those knowledge? 
t1_dv3o8as	0.778300	*	You do know that unions *are* the left, at least economically.  Therefore, by being more interventionist, Trump is becoming a leftie.
t1_duzk38s	0.169500	*	As far as I can see, all they changed was the guys hair and apparently the number of things on the pizza, otherwise it's pretty much a straight trace job.
t1_duoqq2m	0.000000	*	The cocaine is just on vacation applying for visa. 
t1_duwm3q1	0.025800	*	That's upsetting.  Don't give me a raise  *Fine! We'll sue you for all you are worth!*
t1_duc95qv	-0.318200	*	Stop making it profitable for them to hunt orangutans.
t1_dv2ntmi	0.525600	*	The weird part is that 50% of US steel exports go to Canada.. So it's pretty clear that effective retaliation wouldn't be too difficult. 
t1_dubmzm9	0.000000	*	The one politics thread I was in today had everyone equating the NRA to ISIS. Seems to me, accounts seeking to stir division are everywhere.
t1_dv3e91u	0.000000	*	Mans gotta eat, like Egyptians looting their own artifacts to sell on the black market since the tourism economy tanked.
t1_dv1p8ce	-0.631000	*	Probably yes. Fundamental, EU-wide decisions like this, membership of nations, etc require every country.
t1_duaa285	0.476700	*	I don't know about your house, but our doorstep is generally at our door. Not 50 meters away from it. :P
t1_dua88mj	-0.964500	*	I think you're missing the point. Why am I having to fight off anyone?
t1_durhf4n	0.232300	*	We already have common sense gun control, people are the problem. We are raising a generation that lacks the skills to cope with the everyday stress of life.
t1_duflvhq	0.000000	*	That's pretty much exactly what your airplane yells at you before you hit a mountain.
t1_dublhdt	0.476700	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanonenjagdpanzer  and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridsvagn_103 (its called main battle tank there but many refer to its design as similar) 
t1_dv5hkax	-0.790600	*	How is this even REMOTELY correct? Google a map of Polonia , you'll see that Poland's borders are essentially the same since the Roman Empire. Fucking Kraut-loving westerner
t1_dushqk5	0.000000	*	I mean I don't think that my $100 increase per paycheck is fake? 
t1_dulurgx	-0.571900	*	Agreed democracy is no guarantor of rights.  Duerte is a tyrant though.  Extra judicial killings are a very slippery slope.  Today drug kingpins, tomorrow... ?
t1_dumm22r	-0.607200	*	When *reusing* is harming the environment more than helping it's common sense that it is no longer what an environmentalist wants.
t1_dum0bmx	0.202300	*	Key word being they are Canadian. What are you supposed to do? Ban them from their own country?
t1_duxyaq1	0.000000	*	In a better world, I most certainly would.    And for the record, Ive got Iranian friends, and Ive never met an Iranian that I didnt like.  
t1_due8bdr	0.421500	*	You clearly have never been to Cuba. 
t1_dumy94y	0.000000	*	Pants magic pants
t1_dulw8z7	0.726900	*	250ml 4% beer is 1 unit  76ml 13% wine is 1 unit  25ml 40% liquor is 1 unit
t1_dui9ox0	0.207400	*	Yeah he isn't. The way he talks, you would not expect him to be one of the richest man in the world. He's very down to earth.
t1_duzwk8j	0.000000	*	Northern Ontarian here... I basically live in Quetico in the summer and it's been the best part of my life so far. Trying to spread the love of canoeing. It's really a dying art. 
t1_dua4a05	0.773900	*	Most accidents dont happen at very high speeds. Accidents happen because people lose focus and you dont do that when going 150 mph, you do it at 60.
t1_duly1wn	0.362400	*	Regardless of the accuracy of the statement, are you really okay with the person representing your country speaking like that? If you are, I think that really says a lot about you
t1_duc7ep6	0.077200	*	Being hired by someone who commits crimes to do something legal isn't illegal.
t1_dv48gl7	0.501700	*	Pretty good analogy honestly. Like paying for the toll road and it's still slow as shit. lol
t1_dugnzba	0.000000	*	The plea deals that Flynn and Papadoupolous got were extremely lenient, it's obvious that Mueller is building a case to catch someone higher in the chain of command than Manafort.
t1_dv2d9ok	0.000000	*	There is no *more*. They hurt the optimal amount that any Lego brick *can* hurt you. I.e They hurt the *maximum* amount.
t1_dv0hrtv	-0.340000	*	Your company clearly doesn't employ enough staff
t1_duv5zd9	0.000000	*	Yes but not by polluting their country so that it is nearly inhabitable.
t1_duv0q67	0.000000	*	Which North Pole?
t1_dubxi8a	0.673800	*	Thats a really good question actually.  Ive only ever considered trees in regard to carbon dioxide scrubbing (if thats what its even called), but I dont know if they can filter other gases
t1_duanbeu	0.000000	*	Maybe because they were tying to make peace and were scared of another great war? 
t1_dv37hpk	0.401900	*	Is it preferable that if theyre put in the situation they refuse, thereby getting a bullet in their own head? 
t1_durl5ew	0.000000	*	The FBI cannot and should not dictate who can run for office, and who can be on a campaign. The FBI just needs to investigate criminal activity and charge people when appropriate. 
t1_dusw2j1	0.575400	*	Via all the 'voluntary' tax returns they get, of course!  (If you fail to specify another option that money goes automatically to the Catholic Church).
t1_dux84lj	0.000000	*	It's far more complicated than that. Nazi scientists were just as useful and equally escaped punishment. 
t1_duesqa5	0.000000	*	It normally reads like someone having a seizure at a keyboard.
t1_duna1py	0.458800	*	I cant speak for other countries, but many in America loudly support shitty human rights behavior 
t1_due0w47	0.636900	*	these things happen. Many space pioneers didn't make it home. That awful fire in the command module during apollo 1 training comes to mind.
t1_duynl2t	0.000000	*	House of Tards
t1_dudq6br	0.000000	*	The loan shark guy made me spit with rage, sitting there in his empty mansion talking about how he doesn't see he did anything wrong.
t1_dusj7nd	-0.659700	*	Be advised, get rid of this idiot or countries that still are friendly with the US will no longer be very friendly. Just saying.
t1_duxcvmm	-0.680800	*	If it's legal means it's safe. That's what most people think. Legalization would not be a good idea. Look at alcohol being legal. People don't understand how dangerous alcohol is until its too late.
t1_dv02j6j	-0.636000	*	Nothing what you said had any basis in reality. Black Americans are at a massive disadvantage because of choice. Either theirs or their parents choices.
t1_duoy142	-0.746500	*	Thats flat out wrong he was on a shooting team and tied to militia training 
t1_duyj2yf	0.318200	*	I doubt he paid them. I'd say they were supplied and it was even their idea. That's how you get shit on someone!
t1_dujj45d	0.421500	*	Well he already pulled that. He literally blamed Hillary Clinton for not preventing him from getting away with not paying taxes during a debate.
t1_dusf7ao	0.361200	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is never going to be built and even if it were there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it, no matter what he says. 
t1_dv0jnsq	0.000000	*	> Le Pen would happily sue and restrict the speech of people she disagrees with if she had the power.  Proof?
t1_dusfked	0.000000	*	All these non-Muricans comin in here trying to tell us how to fix a problem well never fix on our own. Pffft. Mind your own business. Meddling in other countries affairs is OUR thing!
t1_duyns1j	0.421500	*	Yeah, I thought W was bad, but he's a poet compared to Trump.
t1_dukf0md	0.143100	*	In true troll fashion, he may come out with a statement saying he was quoted out of context and mischaracterized leaving Trump supporters screaming about media bias and dems fretting.  
t1_dus1mux	0.000000	*	Neither is it in the US. People are just scared about the black masks and mad about broken windows more than they hate Nazi's.
t1_duq9011	-0.155600	*	Then what is?
t1_duwr1yg	0.000000	*	Thats not what I am saying. I was just looking for confirmation on the matter. It would be absolutely terrible if it happened. 
t1_duf17md	0.000000	*	Which is insane because as the old ad based model of journalism collapses we should be expanding the CBC and other publicly funded media not cutting its funding. 
t1_duyzx6k	0.000000	*	Close enough 
t1_duvv66s	0.000000	*	[you sir = face palm](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/drug-ads-5-2-billion-annually-and-rising/)

t1_duz54q4	0.000000	*	I support tax payer funded stadiums
t1_duurhwu	0.318200	*	Edited my comment. It's crazy that they only took that one small step and everything is so much better now. 
t1_duv0i87	0.647800	*	Russia has less gdp than Spain. I would not call it one of the four main powers
t1_dua3xto	0.401900	*	Why, in your opinion, is it not?
t1_duh71ge	0.708800	*	Maybe that's why it's useful, hmm?
t1_dv4b9tt	0.421500	*	Internet machine broke

t1_dujf6d4	0.309400	*	Kenyan most likely. Probably illegal immigration and a huge liberal coverup, possibly same people that faked Sandy Hook.
t1_duz6p4j	0.000000	*	And...you don't want your side to win?
t1_dupg2e9	0.757400	*	So, Deutschland xfcber alles?

t1_durcs21	0.000000	*	Take me out. 
t1_duszhge	-0.453000	*	I also want to know this. All the Chinese people in the thread are saying this is a bad thing, and all the other people are also saying it's a bad thing.
t1_dua40yp	-0.977200	*	I think what you are doing is basically calling them stupid. They believe that without sovereignty there might as well not be a UK.
t1_duhy7ys	0.440400	*	Corporations have figured out how to increase profits through processes not people. There is nothing wrong with this. Not even a little bit. 
t1_dv34zke	-0.340000	*	The biggest! Huge folks, that I can tell you. 
t1_duuipir	0.000000	*	That's one sad attempt at being funny but unfortunately it seems you're misinformed. No submarines have sunk themselves lately, maybe you should look into it before making claims. 
t1_duhpzv9	-0.177900	*	Sounds like youre a time traveller. 
t1_dusmk92	0.273200	*	They certainly wouldnt shoot the protesters or bomb apartment blocks before the war began. 
t1_duieyk1	0.452200	*	Singapore is a city-state with very good public transport so cars are only for the elite anyway.
t1_ducof0p	-0.526700	*	I was a little nervous they were rushing it at first, but I'm happy I was wrong.
t1_dv4c7fh	0.318200	*	> people need to learn the etymology of this stuff  No; no we don't. You need to learn that language is a fluid thing.

t1_dup7gdt	0.403300	*	The Senate can't be forced to do the right thing. We have to vote people in who are there to be of service. 
t1_duismud	0.000000	*	Will..... will he leave my avocados alone? 
t1_dv25thl	0.361200	*	Would you want us to say Iared?

t1_dv2o0x7	0.000000	*	No.
t1_duivj24	0.493900	*	Yeah.... Id watch that. But only if it had a catchy jingle.

t1_dv3xf3i	-0.857300	*	Oh I'm sure they monitor who downloads those magazines, but this guy was clearly more than just morbidly curious.

t1_dusi5ve	0.828800	*	This scares the ever living bejeezus outta me because youre right. His supporters believe that he cant do anything wrong and I believe he could get re-elected.
t1_dur7beh	-0.842500	*	You do realise that when these statements were made, Venezuela was actually doing well, right? That's why people kept voting for Chavez. Only after his death, things started going to shit.

t1_dv2qb2q	-0.296000	*	When Trump is threatening a US-Canada trade war, it seems an odd time to start trying to compare him to Reagan...

t1_dul2a7p	0.102700	*	Duterte is bad, but Maduro has basically destroyed the Venezuelan economy. It's about to become a bigger refugee crisis than Syria. 
t1_duztxv3	0.000000	*	Yes, this. The whites can't realistically fight back. There will be no war, just victims.
t1_duibzwo	-0.202300	*	That's not an argument.
t1_duz1sh2	0.371600	*	Not even corruption at this point, Brazil has lost all control and most business are rushing to get their hands on everything to get grandfathered in while a new government forms. 
t1_ducfdbd	0.000000	*	Youre responding to one of them.

t1_dujjpc3	-0.325200	*	There Trump just says that Putin denies the meddling. Obama also believed that there wasn't any meddling before the election and then when he saw the result he changed his tune.
t1_dv2i3ma	-0.567900	*	Though the civilians might claim that's what they want every once in a while, it's no something anyone would practically desire. (as in no sane person would desire a mass genocide)
t1_duk5oh3	-0.836300	*	Yeah, it kind of proves the republican point that stuff like this doesnt need government funding since volunteers and the private sector will take care of it if there is a big enough need.

t1_dupkpyn	0.051600	*	I'm intrigued this comment. Can you elaborate?
t1_duno2dz	-0.526700	*	Then why do we have ever increasing levels of immigration? It sounds like governments want these gated communities of political elite with everyone else falling in line and accepting mediocrity.

t1_dui9tqu	0.936200	*	One of the reasons that my farther never trusted the SDP (and the lib dems) is that they were formed primarily by ministers crossing the floor without triggering a by election.

t1_dui3nxz	0.000000	*	They dont care that their grand kids wont get social security or Medicare because the liberal tears are so sweet and Fox News tells them liberals want to destroy America so anything they want is bad.

t1_duylyl1	0.510600	*	No, he first needs to be absolutely 100% sure the house will unanimously take his recommendation for impeachment. The house is the very first and most important step.

t1_dujilxu	0.383200	*	I love it when its convenient, Puerto Rico suddenly becomes they and not us.
t1_dugbbpv	0.649000	*	If only all of us were so lucky. All of the Trump supporters I know have only double and triple-downed on all of this.
t1_duz8qo0	0.000000	*	Is it really easier to transport large amounts of goods from western europe to china via train instead of using a ship?

t1_dur91yq	0.000000	*	Italy was axis
t1_duw6aa9	-0.542300	*	It will be interesting to see. When the crops fail, who will they blame?

t1_dv27hls	-0.670500	*	Don't worry. Our fuckwit government just shut down local car production, so I'm sure that North Shore prick Turnbull will happily take whatever you produce at favourable rates. 
t1_dv31jhi	0.000000	*	It was different during the campaign. It was like 95% vitriolic anti-Hillary. Most magically disappeared after.
t1_dufa5y3	-0.819500	*	It is, you are seriously proud that the US contains 25% of the world's prison population despite having a small fraction of the world's population?
t1_dujlukj	-0.350600	*	Wait, so he's saying there was an interference? Doesn't that mean that he basically admitted that he worked with the Russians? Or that they at least were responsible for him being president?
t1_dul4p51	0.102700	*	Trump: grab 'em by the pussy!  World: oh, that's awful  Duterte: HMB  Duterte: shoot 'em in the pussy!
t1_duzys6u	0.000000	*	Yeah. No. That's absolute garbage. We have some poorly educated rednecks in more rural areas like anywhere else, but they are the minority and generally shunned.

t1_dunkiba	-0.401900	*	Then you also agree that Obama didn't show any human empathy because he read from a teleprompter, right? 
t1_dufga17	0.636900	*	OK, then.  People had the right to mutilate little baby boys in Iceland. Soon, they won't have that right any more. What's the problem?  
t1_dufsmrm	-0.296000	*	But that's how capitalism works right? You can't have corruption if paying politicians is legal.
t1_dul5c0n	-0.975000	*	Idk if this is a dumb question but why does Duterte hate Obama too?

t1_dv2dljg	0.440400	*	As a former Peace Corps volunteer, the less Trump knows about the agency, the better.   Im guessing he still doesnt know about the agency, because he actually nominated a competent person to run it. 
t1_dv1i08y	0.401900	*	Question. The last symbol in your message :o) Is the o a nose, and the bracket a mouth? Or is the o a mouth, and the bracket a chin?

t1_duhxi5j	0.000000	*	MPs and the unelected Whitehall bureaucrats who serve them.  But mostly MPs. You vote for them. You didn't vote them out for the Maastricht Treaty, so you accepted it.

t1_dv4ita4	0.224400	*	Did you still get the 47 megs down even after they changed the official max speed? 
t1_dv327y8	0.171500	*	We teach many kids that when you die, you go to heaven and see your loved ones. How many young suicides wouldn't happen without that fantasy?
t1_duuq4r0	0.000000	*	Feel free to correct my ignorance. But does this even matter? The Chinese people can't vote for their leader, so it hardly makes much difference if Jinping stays on.
t1_dufy2d8	0.657300	*	>Other words  Your words, not his.
t1_dutg0f7	0.000000	*	Yeah, it's endemic in rats and/or other small mammals. Even if no humans have it, it'll still hang out in the environment.
t1_dubsgcn	-0.690800	*	There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?
t1_duy5hzn	-0.913600	*	Nah. Communists would keep the land for the state, while populists would just redistribute it to the common folk.

t1_dus0ogd	0.000000	*	Hotpockets aren't a veggie.
t1_dv2np9i	-0.361200	*	How can it be a security threat? As a Russian state, it's just Putin making sure the elections go the way he wants to.
t1_duetsgo	0.000000	*	Never knew snowdonia used to be a volcano. Guess I can knock see a volcano off my to to just then as sound alike I have climbed up one without realising!

t1_dui1edm	-0.250000	*	Exactly this, our best economic years occurred when we had much much  higher taxes. Claiming that raising taxes on the super rich is bad for the economy is just ignoring all the data.
t1_dv00m7l	0.000000	*	True. But, I know some places in Canada off the beaten path that would rival anything you'll see in a National Park. 
t1_duqj4ib	0.000000	*	Did Russian funding make Hillary collapse and have to be carried off into a van?
t1_dustonv	0.592700	*	Yeah but then replaced them with another autocracy.

t1_dumykn4	0.000000	*	Putin never has a problem finding his way out of his shirt. 
t1_dv038oo	0.571900	*	This is effectively what will happen if we continue to allow ourselves to be demographically displaced. I'm just trying to prevent this conversation from happening again. 
t1_dulx7gv	0.000000	*	That's still nowhere near as bad as Duterte ordering death squads to murder thousands of people. And Duterte didn't just say that, he actually did it.
t1_duk0rst	0.440400	*	Trump will want it televised... just think of the ratings he could pull. Best rated show Mr. President - how can you refuse?

t1_duz7ka8	0.606400	*	But that's like a regular Tuesday in China.   From 2006 to 2016 China doubled its number of tunnels from 7k to 15k tunnels... or 2 new tunnels per day.

t1_dut5aio	0.224900	*	Your definition of either socialism or fascism is mistaken. Fundamentally, they're incompatible with each other as fascism is entirely against marxist-leninist ideals.

t1_dug4i3w	0.232100	*	How.  Russia went out of it's way to cheat, and did so on an industrialized scale.  They should be banned for decades.

t1_dujjagr	0.000000	*	There's no amount of Hoops you bootlickers won't jump through to try and make sense of his words

t1_duvth3r	0.000000	*	Yep, it was a metaphor. This process is understood by me as my post history indicates. I was merely leaving some insight, I didn't think it needed that level of specificity. 
t1_dugfi2i	0.476700	*	Wow, manly man, not being able to resist meat and owning a gun makes you sooooo masculine. I'm swooning, and I'm a guy. 
t1_duqt9gz	0.388500	*	Yeah only 1/3 of industry got taken over by the state and look what happened. Lets hope they dont keep going 
t1_duur6jw	-0.599400	*	Did you die, Rip.
t1_duq2fx8	0.000000	*	Awww, he doesn't know what a metaphor is.
t1_duq04ne	-0.527100	*	Chaos is probably too strong a word. More like they took a dump and we have to just deal with having their steaming turd be omnipresent for 4 years.
t1_dv1r2wb	0.200600	*	You and I both know that Trump has no idea what youre talking about and it will not be part of the conversation. 
t1_dup7fee	0.000000	*	Him being a dirt bag up to his eyes in oligarch business was known. But the media ignored most of it
t1_dup8zj7	0.361200	*	Good old whataboutism strikes again.  edit: ah, 23 day old account. Probably ban evasion. 
t1_duonjl5	0.000000	*	PAM!!!!!
t1_dugwtqi	-0.612400	*	Turks have lived under secularism and liberalism for 80 years now. Clearly they are tired of it, and are returning back to Islam. 
t1_duemwbc	0.008800	*	A judge needs to sentence him for his crimes, and his lawyer will likely ask for a reduced sentence as a result of this assault.
t1_dutlzhc	-0.886200	*	So what your saying is a vaccine basically prevents you from getting the mumps, but you can still get the mumps because somebody else gave you the mumps. Nice.
t1_dur79s9	-0.296000	*	There have been mass shootings since, also mass stabbings,burning's,bludgeoning's,drivings etc.
t1_dv06i59	-0.032000	*	Im all for gun rights as the next person but literally no one is planning a white genocide in the US. That is simply not a threat. 
t1_dv2zh70	-0.360400	*	Russian trolls will push any narrative that makes Americans mad at other Americans.  And yes, people do talk about that on reddit. 
t1_dujtt2t	-0.340000	*	Unfortunately not enough voters (in the right locations) care that he lies. No matter how many times you scream it. 
t1_duhr1zz	0.822500	*	And then Valeant would buy your company and raise the prices again....we're back to square one. 
t1_ductnkl	0.000000	*	For a second I was almost worried that corporations would be able to influence elections. But it's okay, they're American corporations so they definitely have my best interests in mind.
t1_dushuti	-0.476700	*	Fixed it. Thanks.
t1_dulgmtn	0.077200	*	Nope. I wouldn't shake hands with an Olympic delegation from current North Korea, either. I have no idea why people here think Pence should.
t1_dv3ejti	-0.248100	*	> NO of course it's not true!  Source required.  I'm looking at a direct quote from her admitting to them, so....

t1_ducruq4	0.000000	*	These comments directly undercut trump-collusion claims but you're free to believe/hope whatever you wish, this is good news. I have a feeling there's more news to come today.
t1_durcw6v	-0.873900	*	> The bombs were terrible, but in a way they saved many people.   Funny how brainwashed Americans are.
t1_duzh3hc	-0.736900	*	I feel that he gives away so many nicknames that its always funny if one resurfaces. I didnt realize there was a movement though, kinda like how Trump took the Deplorables moniker to heart?
t1_duhtrwr	0.000000	*	Atheists and agnostics don't have kids much whereas Muslims (and religious folk in general) worldwide are very productive in this aspect.  
t1_dui92jb	0.493900	*	Maybe federal income taxes but poor people still pay social security/Medicare/gas/ property/sales tax/tolls so yeah its not like the bottom is getting a free ride. 
t1_duqhoec	-0.959300	*	Russia's been fighting terrorism since the 90's. In other words, since the fall of the Soviet Union. 
t1_duf21r0	-0.051600	*	Scolded...pleb.

t1_dush33m	0.177900	*	We can trust they're incompetent and nearly useless, if Florida showed us anything. 
t1_duphufh	-0.064400	*	Funny how when you have a society that is positive about the role of government and strict laws on campaign funding that you end up with better results than in the US. 
t1_duxez9f	-0.493900	*	Seconding whoever called you a cunt. Making light of anyone not being allowed to be their own person is fucking sick. 
t1_dv0t2ip	-0.526700	*	Doesn't Europe have a total ban on GMOs? Which would not be the best thing to do if science and facts held sway...
t1_duet8rn	0.000000	*	Why deflect when you can just be laughing it up for a year. You go on though. Waste more time. We've been busy and making each day brighter.  I have not been this happy for years! Each and every day!
t1_dufnq2a	0.340000	*	66 passengers, six crew. It would have been likely that there were 2 pilots, 2 security, and two hostesses/servers on the plane.

t1_duy3tif	0.000000	*	I can't help but remember that fascism and communism were in vogue in the first few decades of the previous century. At least we made it past 1914/2014 so yay no major wars so far?

t1_dugw01h	-0.296000	*	yep it's the thought that counts I guess, but this is a poor job done syllable-wise, especially that last line
t1_dv4aflg	-0.726900	*	Yes, absolutely

t1_dui4z5r	0.862900	*	It's also an issue that we do not have more tax brackets. Yes, someone making $500k/year is well off, but they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year. 
t1_dv28apa	0.318200	*	Can we start normalizing squatting if this starts happening? 
t1_dv35q1h	0.361200	*	And yet they ignore all of the /r/politics time to kill all Conservatives/bring back the guillotines comments.

t1_dv47qfz	0.000000	*	There's other stuff that can be done too like smart caching of commonly transferred content. I don't know anything about how ISPs function though.. they might be doing this already.
t1_dv2ii9d	0.000000	*	Technically a plurality of us did not vote for him. I try and remind his supporters of this fact as much as possible.
t1_dupkxrc	0.000000	*	Come live in 'murica. That's the same message Trump pushed about Hillary. You'll like what he's doing for us!
t1_duwsgix	0.296000	*	Honestly, I'd be less worried if AGI comes out of China. They seem like they're sensible enough to put restrictions on AI development to make sure it's Friendly AI, which America certainly isn't. 
t1_duo8w3q	-0.458800	*	Is that the absolutely jacked Jesus, because that's the Jesus I believe in.
t1_duhnkij	0.000000	*	Granite specifically.

t1_duvlp6i	-0.273200	*	Apparently even acknowledging the problem is a big step for some. But besides that, polluting less would be good.
t1_dv2se6j	-0.648600	*	Both Trump and Sanders have used the word disaster to describe NAFTA, saying it has led to the loss of hundreds of thousands American jobs.  Also from the article I quoted

t1_duxiiq6	-0.569300	*	How are women oppressed in fucking America?
t1_dv0ffrf	-0.853300	*	Comparitivly your argument has no ground to stand on. Yes the US is fucked, but Mexico is in another dimension of fucked. Not very often you see bodies hung from over passes in the states.
t1_dv2smqr	-0.476700	*	CBC and BBC are very very anti-Trump.   On anything else, they are balanced, but on Trump issues, especially ones that negatively impact Canada and the UK, don't expect balanced coverage.
t1_dv50eqf	0.000000	*	That explains their garbage engines

t1_duvk7s7	0.000000	*	Maybe it was hubris and they were checking to see how distracted their weapon in the Whitehouse is making the rest of the military. Not enough obviously.

t1_duuhmws	-0.817600	*	I don't really care. It's hilarious we would call out Iran while the US selling arms to Saudi probably causes more death. It's just a double standard.

t1_duf9ty7	-0.727400	*	CBC is incredibly biased. It should be defunded. They only show a left side view point.
t1_dulnu4s	-0.988900	*	So, should we argue for or agains banning assault trucks in germany or france? Oh wait...  And nobody in america argues against taking guns from criminals.

t1_dui4z5r	0.709600	*	It's also an issue that we do not have more tax brackets. Yes, someone making $500k/year is well off, but they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year.

t1_duq04ne	-0.648600	*	Chaos is probably too strong a word. More like they took a dump and we have to just deal with having their steaming turd be omnipresent for 4 years.

t1_duapg6q	0.128000	*	Choice/free will/individual autonomy explains everything, and nothing.  Your observation is not insightful.

t1_dv2sz56	-0.624900	*	I'm not saying they have no blame or have made the best choices, I'm just saying that there is obvious bias in US media towards ignoring the whole picture. Thanks for being condescending though.

t1_durf7w1	-0.915500	*	What bothers me is that they're all for spreading awareness on how they were wronged but thats about all they know about world war two since they want to keep all their wrongs hidden.
t1_ducr9cb	0.000000	*	You won't believe what they said in tweet #157,233! 
t1_dundeqd	0.000000	*	It takes a good deal of energy and cost to recycle plastic.  There is plenty of waste still generated, both in emissions and byproducts. 
t1_durgygp	-0.746600	*	Maybe Germany should start sending around storytellers for the Allies and Soviet invasion of their country at the end of WWII.

t1_duiz7ar	0.844200	*	Yes but there were far more poles who did so willingly because they hated Jews/liked Nazis. That's why a lot of people are angry, I can't think of many Jews that weren't forced
t1_duqlpn7	0.000000	*	When will then be now?
t1_dujmoov	-0.557400	*	Or not; they have now, at least, realised that being free is better than being part of Germany's empire, and from the Continent I applaud them for that.
t1_dui4z5r	0.000000	*	It's also an issue that we do not have more tax brackets. Yes, someone making $500k/year is well off, but they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year.

t1_dv00vv2	0.000000	*	This is what surprises me. I'd have expected the West to come to defend them. Or is it because there is no oil or other natural resource to exploit so they aren't interested?

t1_dui4gi4	0.750100	*	I agree, capital gains should be considered income and taxed the exact same as income tax. Makes no sense that rich people pay less percentage wise then their secretaries
t1_ducxwhr	0.201400	*	So we are losing rainforest because people dont want to eat butter ?  
t1_dul8obu	0.967700	*	Well, there was the time he said he was a dictator, which was a bit ironic considering he told his army to shoot him if he was one.

t1_dujhfki	0.000000	*	the next celebrity president. Sounds like baba Vanga was right. Obama will be the last real president 
t1_dv19qav	0.000000	*	Not sure why the downvotes. There is a notable difference between systematic and systemic. You're not being pedantic 
t1_ducvqq5	0.226300	*	The Kurdish factions are all pretty left wing, full of Marxists and such, so they can rely on international support from other communist groups.

t1_dusm4ik	0.308900	*	Foreigners don't hunt with nets, they either use falcons or shotguns, and the numbers they hunt aren't significant.

t1_duq404c	-0.757900	*	how is this a conspiracy theory 
t1_duuq4r0	0.858100	*	Feel free to correct my ignorance. But does this even matter? The Chinese people can't vote for their leader, so it hardly makes much difference if Jinping stays on.
t1_dv2jnmy	0.473800	*	There doesn't need to be. There are enough stupid Americans out there that think exactly like Trump that one of them was bound to reach the presidency. This is the outcome. 
t1_dup8o32	0.286900	*	Give children less guns, rape less women, tear down walls. Opposite trump is a dream.
t1_dv3hfps	-0.624900	*	Can I come into your house and write a thesis on UBI in my own shit on your wall? You wouldn't want to censor me right? I have a first amendment right to write with my own shit on your wall.
t1_dv3ysx0	0.000000	*	The worst part is that elephants are likely sapient. Which makes our killing of them genocide. 
t1_dujhtwn	0.000000	*	Some how gets away with it.
