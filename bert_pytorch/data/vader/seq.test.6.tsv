t1_dua54fs	0.000000	*	I won't leave you this time.

t1_ducx75a	0.557400	*	I stayed home rather than vote for Clinton, but that didn't particularly make a difference in Massachusetts. 
t1_dun0rit	-0.419900	*	Why do you think this isn't my real account? How do you even make fake accounts?  Way to derail the discussion with unimportant theories.. Even if my account was fake, the claim talks for itself.
t1_duut9wx	0.000000	*	How in the actual fuck...  Isn't he like 10 times worse than Trump?
t1_dujsg90	0.000000	*	So it's ok for the government to decide when it's ok for me to die? That should be up to the parents of this child, not some court. 
t1_duyigne	0.000000	*	republicans have to
t1_duq5i8k	0.000000	*	Or have it run by the current citizens (Jews and Muslims) like the other city states that have come before it. 
t1_dunegn9	-0.332600	*	I really dont understand what those up and down votes mean. How do they affect me?  I still can post, answer and vote.  
t1_duq547k	-0.906500	*	Only decades if you dont elect better govt in the next two cycles. Right now youre only about 1.5 years behind, not decades. And the US still has the economic clout to catch up if you care to.
t1_duj4hbs	-0.771200	*	Australia already has running desalination plants. We're not going to die of thirst as a species, we just have to get thirsty enough to actually do something about it.
t1_dufu737	0.414400	*	It was relevant to the conversation, chill out.  I hadn't heard of it. 
t1_dv4u35v	0.273200	*	>I betrayed America from the start and worked with Putin  I like him because he tells it like it is
t1_duyoxhd	0.000000	*	I feel like I'm missing a reference.
t1_dv4ujbb	0.542300	*	It's like he found out comic villain plans don't work in real life.
t1_duor91y	-0.905900	*	That's why i'm saying it's ironic, that they who claim to fight it use the exact same tactics as them.
t1_duy2lzp	0.485400	*	We do, and probably a huge number of them shoot competitive. But they use special guns- not suitable for hunting
t1_dunmv42	-0.440400	*	Oh right, so here, they are using it kind of like a slang, right? Like Oppa to someone older. Calling her little sibling to kind of emphasize the inequality?
t1_dun5yv3	0.680800	*	Although that doesn't include the homeless, because they don't pay taxes. Or are you suggesting that the homeless shouldn't get help?
t1_dusixue	0.567300	*	So is all of America :(
t1_duzo8sz	0.000000	*	Ive lived in philly and Germany  cannot find anywhere in Germany where street crime comes close to American slums

t1_duda4z8	0.151100	*	Ah so confirmation bias is exceptionally American. I see.
t1_dv3bg64	0.340000	*	> 4chan would be a fucking mess to investigate with low rewards for the extra effort anyways  Why do people think the feds don't pay attention to 4chins in microscopic detail
t1_dubjxh7	0.128000	*	Are you suggesting that I'm suggesting personal agreement with the point of view of these 2nd amendment nuts? Explaining their view does not equal that I subscribe to their idea.  So short answer: no
t1_duq5x0n	0.624900	*	Dude wasn't even open carrying one, he picked up an unboxed one and was walking through the store, presumably going to purchase it.
t1_dudqysx	-0.690800	*	It certainly should be a thing. Medicine shouldn't really be for corporate profits.
t1_durp6fc	-0.950900	*	When a country has 1/10 the population of another... there are bound to be less massacres or shootings.
t1_dudrbq7	0.000000	*	No but I would get mad if Toyota raised the price of the Camry by 2200% even if the Honda Civic and VW Jetta were still available
t1_dv4mjxb	0.000000	*	Yes, it is beneficial short distant wise. Healthy and more enjoyable than car ride for me. How do make it more long distance? 
t1_dulaw6s	-0.457000	*	> making the world a worse place  That's a matter of opinion.  
t1_duzwfvg	0.531000	*	Yeah, but American.
t1_duc9con	-0.767000	*	Maybe because driving a car is a privilege, not a right? Kind of like having a child vs adopting one?   Just a thought. 
t1_dud51s1	0.911000	*	I can use that same logic with the Steele Dossier that Hillary paid for if you want to argue that.
t1_dulk6io	-0.883900	*	To be fair, unless the guy actually took any kind of action against them. It doesn't mean much what he said or thought. 
t1_dv0o6e2	0.401900	*	Partly because we dont have school shootings over here lol 
t1_dv4ywua	-0.128000	*	That...is not an answer.
t1_duz4o7x	0.202300	*	So are we all....
t1_duf48k9	0.493900	*	Eh, conservatives get downvoted in r/politics, but not banned. It's just the demographics of the site lean left.  t_d outright bans anyone not on the narrative.
t1_dub7t6x	0.000000	*	The error you're making is thinking in absolutes. Without regulations, banks would fuck over more people. This goes into my comment that the lack of regulations facilitated this issue. 
t1_duv45eh	0.000000	*	Since you seem like a stand up dude... I'm going to go say you purchased a plush toy for your niece. 
t1_dupdpqq	0.886000	*	They do, this thread is about armenian genocide.  If everyone waits to right their wrongdoings until everyone else does then justice will conveniently never get served.  This is your goal
t1_dubq38p	-0.296000	*	Populations have their limits. We will reach ours invariably 
t1_duzz5sq	-0.862500	*	Or any other socialist country.
t1_dugkc5n	-0.659700	*	I'm not expecting some result. I'm just getting fucking annoyed that people keep fucking the rest of us over for no reason. 
t1_dudr44j	-0.102200	*	Modern Greece and modern Germany have very little to do with the ancient Greeks or Germanic tribes. Both areas have changed people's, changed cultures, been invaded and ruled by non-natives, etc.
t1_duzqypw	0.493900	*	Oh, Pence, Trump, Di Stefano (Italian PM candidate), anyone in British First or the Alternative for Germany parties.  These are one's I know the name without doing a google search. 
t1_dv0tjts	-0.176100	*	I vaguely remember hearing about it.  No source though.  I have a reply with a bad link above, so unless I can source it it's just heresay at best. 
t1_duss6rb	0.497300	*	> Maoist   You know what's the kicker? A bunch of (self-claimed) Maoist students were detained for holding a reading club one or two weeks ago in China.
t1_duq6i6u	0.340000	*	What evidence is there that they supported Bernie? What would they gain from that anyway?
t1_dui3i5b	-0.659300	*	so.. they're right... ?
t1_dueswog	0.421500	*	Red kangaroos tend not to have worms. Western greys can be pretty pointless to shoot though
t1_duriolk	0.000000	*	I feel like every country can have a rant but Americans dominate reddit so their shit is always front and center because it's most relevant to them. 
t1_dushwfv	0.440400	*	only if we radically redefine what a wall is.
t1_duu8mhi	-0.440400	*	Who called in the fleet?
t1_dv0daob	0.241100	*	Many people loved Hitler too. Prove a single thing I said wrong.
t1_duoqo8x	0.000000	*	Yeah pretty much. I certainly wouldn't have demanded a witch-hunt against a random DOD virologist for the Anthrax Letter terrorist attacks when there was no evidence to support it.
t1_dujdo1d	-0.796400	*	Well yes, hence me liking her for those reasons. Weird if it wasn't the case, eh?
t1_dugug1w	-0.340000	*	Hes part pig, part Cheeto. Not sure about the life expectancy of this creature.
t1_dulg3rx	-0.868100	*	Hell, SCIENCE and religion went hand in hand. When the most readily available source of literate people in the world with lots of free time were men of religion, no shit.
t1_dv0vdll	-0.470700	*	We have to protect the children!!!! - the pearl clutchers
t1_duwtpd3	0.235400	*	We have a saying here in America- your nurse is the only heart your doctor has.   (Its a blanket statement- we have wonderful, caring docs as well, but a lot of them can be full of themselves.) 
t1_durfk9q	0.000000	*	Commodore Perry is Japanese apologetics' go-to excuse. 
t1_dur7pfx	-0.526700	*	This guilt you speak of does not exist, people who have never been to Germany like to use that idea though.
t1_duyksnq	0.000000	*	Til lying about doing something legal equals collusion to steal an election. 
t1_dupp1ds	0.000000	*	Well, it's not impossible.  I would think that educating your children, the future of your country, would be a bi-partisan priority.
t1_duz9ut4	0.526700	*	Not even this, Belarus is already de facto part of Russian and even without one vacation of unaligned mechanized infantry, artillery, and air support they would still vote to join Russia
t1_dukqwci	0.000000	*	Filipino here -- as long as you have mobile credits, you can access Facebook and Facebook Messenger (and Viber) for free. Just those apps. Everything else you already pay extra. It's called Free Data.
t1_duq5daj	0.475400	*	I just meant in general overall health and appearance. Like are there a lot of tall blue-eyed blondes for example.
t1_dugwhnz	-0.836000	*	Obama never used Twitter to announce policy decisions.
t1_duthviz	0.000000	*	Literally in the article > Per the New York Times, many of the infections in Romania were among the Roma, who often fail to vaccinate children [...]
t1_dv5b7z3	0.850400	*	> Sources briefed on the Mueller investigation.  Why am I not surprised?  Give me another example.
t1_dub7qzc	0.000000	*	Its actually not true and there are countries and diplomats that make suboptimal foreign policy agreements and decisions all the time in the name of morals or doing the right thing.  
t1_dunsh25	-0.596500	*	Trump literally just pardoned [Joe Arpaio , who ran self described concentration camps](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/joe-arpaio-tent-city-a-concentration-camp-6500984).
t1_duae2bv	0.000000	*	eat a dick
t1_dut4tku	0.000000	*	Taiwan doesn't exist to them. That's just a group of rebels who have taken over Chinese territory. 
t1_duagymq	-0.542300	*	Try Finland! They're a close second. 
t1_duu8mhi	0.000000	*	Who called in the fleet?
t1_duql0li	-0.585900	*	Yes he cut a deal :) which means he has value in the investigation. 
t1_duzygm1	0.000000	*	Wrong America guy
t1_dv0p6gg	-0.296000	*	Ah interesting, makes far more sense
t1_duedech	0.000000	*	Kim Jong Un isnt in power. His cabinet is. 
t1_dv2oeph	0.421500	*	Stupid question: if Canada has steel, and the US has steel, why export to each other? Why not just keep your own steel? 
t1_dv48g4p	0.624900	*	/u/tippr 100 bits
t1_duw0cdb	-0.909500	*	What?  Nope, the Climate has always remained the same on Earth, until humans started driving cars that is.  Humans driving cars changed the Climate of the entire Planet.
t1_dujvwaq	0.000000	*	I skimmed it and couldn't find such clause. Can you quote it directly from the paris agreement?
t1_dumvas0	-0.890800	*	Id rather my kid spend 180+ days a year in a room without a gun than with a superior who is holds domain over them and also has a firearm. Easy answer.
t1_duer94a	-0.775000	*	A beating is a criminal matter, not a personal (IE civil) matter, but otherwise I agree with you.
t1_duuyxm0	0.576400	*	I wonder how he is still alive.   In our country anybody can get a gun and practice up freely. I dont know how someone from one of the many groups he's wronged hasn't just blown him away.
t1_dugsi2r	0.000000	*	I wonder if the Russians did the same thing in Britain for Brexit as they did in the USA for the election
t1_duza1sf	-0.917700	*	Yeahhhhhh...... gonna need a source bro. 
t1_duzc62h	-0.867800	*	Well that's concerning. Can you think at all? How do you find the door knob when you leave your home?
t1_duh6eis	0.273200	*	Because you are spouting a stupid meme, or you seriously think they are a Russian being paid to post on reddit. Im not sure which is worse.
t1_durjclh	-0.401900	*	A budget surplus doesn't necessarily earmark good economic management. Not that we're making the most of our expenditure, however. 
t1_dulmli7	-0.401900	*	Uh, Israel  sells itself as fighters of racism and apartheid while they're actually purveyors of racism and apartheid?
t1_dur13v7	0.401900	*	You're right. At this point I don't see how the country can improve until the GOP and their supporters are somehow reduced to irrellevance, and I don't see that happening anytime soon.
t1_duphmt9	0.076200	*	It would be hard to replace them.
t1_dv3vc75	0.190100	*	I think saving the species is the right choice, but I dont see how its not natural selection.  If a monkey throws a rock or an Orca kills for fun is it no longer natural selection?
t1_dujk1vs	-0.361200	*	So at worst he's too trusting. But that doesn't make him guilty of any crime. And again Obama believed Putin too when he was president.
t1_dui1oxu	0.000000	*	Its not clear why that dislike for the US would lead someone to favor nuclear proliferation...
t1_dugpkfw	0.831600	*	Lol

t1_dv2h2wy	-0.557400	*	God damn, dude. That sucks. But you're a hero.
t1_dubfj84	0.510600	*	Honestly, if youre using pussy whipped to describe political phenomena, you deserve to starve to death. 
t1_dutdcqb	-0.153100	*	Why are you so angry at Americans in Korea?   Do you want to talk about it? Living life full of hate is not good

t1_dus3hc4	-0.935600	*	So Covfefe was a hard hitting tweet about US policy from Trump that was really news worthy? I remember seeing that top the news cycle for weeks.   It's lazy journalism without substance. 
t1_dv3fzus	0.670500	*	I think 'cognitive dissonance' is already pretty apt.
t1_duen5yx	0.400500	*	Ding ding ding. You engineer things so human error doesn't cause deaths. It's pretty much the entire point of the field now. Make 5hings that work and aren't easy for people to kill themselves with. 
t1_duu2u28	0.000000	*	I was referring to the use of the term ALL Republicans based on his anecdotal evidence about 'just about all of them.'  Your question is loaded by the way.
t1_dufhut8	-0.962300	*	is that a popular feminist viewpoint? if so, fuck them. All babies should be protected from mutilation.
t1_duks3sm	0.128000	*	As if the recruits had a choice. It's called being voluntold.
t1_dua6oau	0.000000	*	Aye, and he's admitted it was shit and people still trott that fucking figure out.  Zero consequence game lying to a nation.

t1_duonyy3	0.000000	*	Sure, sure. But really, what has he done recently?? He's just coasting on his past glory. A has-been.
t1_duux7c9	-0.596200	*	But he *needs* his *medicine*. He has constant migraines due to the cognitive dissonance and repressed shame.

t1_dv474t4	0.273200	*	at like what, peasant settings? 640x480?
t1_dv0pxnn	0.000000	*	It has been proven innocent. They just keep arbitrarily moving the goalposts, because at the end of the day it's about gmo sounding scary rather than science. 
t1_duhpafs	0.000000	*	No idea if it were preplanned but it's definitely a power move. It was at a sports game if I remember. It was all over Chinese social media like, Can you believe Xi put up with that shit?
t1_dumhuza	0.457600	*	Chicken, egg. Would you blame the Mexican government for not being able to control the cartels?
t1_dunvavo	0.000000	*	Oh sorry, my mistake.  People died but yeah, all on me for misunderstanding...something?  (and the wait time is at the state level and very few states have a long grace period)

t1_durazy8	0.000000	*	What invasion of Europe are you referring to exactly?

t1_dv2gy0k	0.000000	*	It has nothing to do with Russian oil and everything to do with mutual political interests and financial support.   Edit: Why am I being downvoted? This is geopolitics 101.

t1_dudrfx2	-0.359500	*	I mean...it's pretty obvious that the market gets distorted in the first place by IP protection...
t1_duql0ep	-0.153100	*	Yeah, wait, I can get more time for possession than I can for conspiracy against the united states!?  I think something might be broken.

t1_dukxg6l	-0.920800	*	You're telling me to be complacent about a regime that killed hundreds of thousands of people and committed mass murders? That's not like the crimes committed by the Nazis? What are you high on

t1_dup2ban	0.000000	*	Try google 
t1_dueikha	0.592700	*	Yeah, but different legislation counters those. They've basically set a lot of things up so that the courts decide what's what through precedence. Now money is law, rather than common sensibilities.

t1_duo07do	0.190100	*	Dude it's called The **PATRIOT** act. You're being unamerican now.

t1_dv3gat4	-0.401900	*	/r/politics is the same or even worse. Actually /r/T_D and /r/politics are trash but instead of seeing /r/T_D on the Front Page Reddit is artificially putting /r/politics on the Front Page 
t1_duv6vb2	-0.296000	*	When they announced they're going to the moon, I thought wow can't wait to see how much trash is left behind  but I felt like a jerk.

t1_dux92jz	-0.680800	*	> Japan isn't ruled by the same government anymore, the war criminals aren't the ones in charge.  Then why should they apologize and provide restitution?

t1_dv2oeph	0.421500	*	Stupid question: if Canada has steel, and the US has steel, why export to each other? Why not just keep your own steel? 
t1_dv06nk7	0.401900	*	I actually have amounted to a lot, all of which I earned. Maybe don't blame racism because you didn't succeed.

t1_dur8zic	0.859100	*	You said Canada has no guns. The lie detector test determined that was a lie. Your point about the US having more guns than people would be valid if I had claimed they didnt, which I never did. 
t1_dug0tlh	0.922100	*	Having a state for a specific race is universally the goal of racism
t1_dv1vxw6	-0.411800	*	So football, everything, and cobblestone are all nonsensical, too? And the thousands of other English compound words?
t1_dv49idc	0.095100	*	Why not mention the racism that has always been on r/canada towards First Nations people?  How come issues of my people are always pushed to the back burner in favor of defending Islam?

t1_durhcl7	0.102700	*	I don't give a fuck.  I fully understand war crime denial and attempts to rewrite history.  What pisses me off is having to read about it in every fucking thread about Japan regardless of the topic.

t1_dv0uaiw	-0.421500	*	We in the first world are so good at helping! 
t1_dv2og42	-0.518700	*	Not to mention dependent trade agreements prevent war. The creation of the EU was a direct response to WWII. Why kill your neighbor when you can trade and compete like civilized people. 
t1_duzwmn0	-0.261700	*	I'm not so sure, the west doesn't give much of a shit about Africa as is. The fact that a major city is about to run out of water isn't on too many headlines either.

t1_dv1pv0i	0.440400	*	I'm pretty sure it was done by brittish soldiers, the notion that it was done by Canadians seems to have come up as a result of Canadian Nationalism.   (I'm Canadian btw)

t1_durnau6	-0.516500	*	As a history buff and homo sentient, I can say that I hated Russian history and culture long before Reddit. When Russians decide to be good people en masse, then I will think higher of them.

t1_dum59gi	0.831600	*	Yeah, I'm just joking. You can't properly compare safety of American schools to safety of Nigerian schools in the country side.

t1_duq7f1f	0.000000	*	Yeah the FBI refused comment.  So this is entirely based on leaks. Which A. Would be a felony and B. thus far into the consul I can't recall a single leak that was true.

t1_dv0fgle	0.831600	*	The worry I have about working such long hours is essentially losing my social life, losing all my friends, having no time to meet women or get laid.  How do you fit that stuff into your life?
t1_dusk633	-0.378100	*	Why? Are other people somehow less deserving than than the people who were lucky enough to be born in America?
t1_dupnf06	0.438900	*	Oh no... I did not know... damn, that explains a couple of comments I received. Those were damn hostile. Sorry...

t1_duz1et6	0.273200	*	I lived there. Russia definitely has influence there, but at a price. Russia has to provide discounts on natural gas/oil to have things go the way it wants.
t1_dusywoo	0.000000	*	I get it but what chance does some guys with guns have against the US military and the militarized police forces? They going to storm the white house?

t1_duvqcpx	-0.968900	*	The reason why there isn't any ''real'' opposition in Russia is because Putin is actively marginalizing,oppressing, and sometimes kills anyone who oppose him.
t1_duy7iyo	0.374400	*	Well, good for you. I own semi autos and many people own them, and we still manage to have one of the lowest homicide rates in the world here in Switzerland.  So there's that.

t1_dur94qp	0.000000	*	Thats good.  Reactionary fear based constitution shredding gun control should be resisted by the adults in the room.
t1_duqpid2	0.000000	*	That's fairly accurate but the session is itself a reassurance from the prosecution that they just want info, not looking for ways to fuck you further. 
t1_dunqxe4	-0.440400	*	ok then. why?
t1_duwxhfx	0.000000	*	Yeah okay, more liberal bullshit.         Trump will build a wall on the Mexico Brazil border and Mexico will pay for it. You watch.

t1_dungnkk	0.421500	*	That's the culture. In this day and age, America has progressed to the point where guns for political change are pretty much useless.   Edit: wrong comment

t1_duyjhwf	-0.451700	*	They saw Hillary, someone who had been in politics before, and Trump, someone who hadn't. It's easy to see why they supported him. Dismissing them as stupid is just going to lead to a repeat.

t1_dugnu3n	0.338400	*	People voted Trump because they agreed with more of what he said than Hillary. He said some very icky things, but Hillary, to them, was ickier.  And so he was elected.
t1_duntazj	0.357800	*	I mean the NN thing, kind of. It was part of her platform. I don't know about the Iraq thing though, people forget how everyone was 100 percent on board with that after 9/11.

t1_dv39g2b	0.867400	*	The News is full of ant-Trump propaganda yet you still couldn't win. Maybe it was your shitty candidate.
t1_dv0omus	-0.765000	*	Well, yea. It's our right to bear arms that protects our freedom of speech.  What's happening here is the French government is restricting freedom of speech by threat of gun.

t1_duxr4qy	0.102700	*	Less freedom = more safety ... right? 
t1_duphzfy	0.238200	*	Well yes, but it's based on a real thing. Back in the late 70s-early 80s it was discovered that the US military was spending outrageous sums for ordinary things like the aforementioned.

t1_dv25x95	0.000000	*	That's great buddy. But my point actually was that the country you say the US is helping is actually part of the United States...

t1_duoroah	0.421500	*	do tell
t1_duz8du6	0.979000	*	Well it can be done but it would be expensive. That money will have to come from somewhere.  The northeast is probably the only place in the US where high speed rail is actually feasible though.

t1_dur972r	-0.414900	*	This is not correct either (kinda? Can be read in a couple ways).  Non-combat (and non-military) civilian service is acceptable. An example of this is how Switzerland treats the situation.
t1_dv41szk	0.000000	*	Everyone has a level of blame, but some are worse than others. Who has a pop of 1.4 billion?
t1_duc5bso	0.000000	*	No one is surprised. Not a single person doesnt know this. However, it doesnt have to be like that and we can do better, which is the whole fucking point.

t1_dulg8pp	-0.223500	*	Good point. I would like us to stop being little bitches about it. Unfortuntely, having Putin's bitchboy Trump as president certainly ain't helping. 
t1_duv345e	-0.948000	*	None of those links say that migrants are the cause of this 20% rise in rapes this year, though.

t1_dv0chho	0.000000	*	Its an apt comparison when talking about park costs. 
t1_durc768	0.102700	*	Yeah there's no moral justification. In terms of WWII crimes, however, it's not that high on the list.

t1_dudz01s	-0.177900	*	That isn't relevant though. Just because A is bad doesn't mean that B can get a pass when it is also bad.

t1_dv4a6zl	-0.341200	*	Both are bad examples.  You can get a fixed rate mortgage, and you _should_ get a fixed rate mortgage with few exceptions.  I'm not a loan officer but I believe it's actually harder to get an ARM. 
t1_duiee5w	0.700300	*	Except the period in U.S. history with the most social mobility occurred when income tax rates were 20% for the lowest earners and 90% for those at the top. 
t1_duy3j8h	0.419900	*	In Russia we only had two TV channels. Channel One was propaganda. Channel Two consisted of a KGB officer telling you: Turn back at once to Channel One!

t1_duzwmn0	0.361200	*	I'm not so sure, the west doesn't give much of a shit about Africa as is. The fact that a major city is about to run out of water isn't on too many headlines either.

t1_duydbo2	0.000000	*	That's .... kind of my point. You don't need an AR-15 to hunt. It's not actually well suited to do it, whether it's a Moose, a deer or a rabbit.
t1_duhttbt	0.000000	*	Hits the rich  Yeah ok buddy! Because they are soooo hard up! Yupp if we tax them at a reasonable rate they arent gonna fare so well. Exactly the same results as if we fuck the poor. Yupp.

t1_dunfmy3	-0.790600	*	Except he died in custody after arrest. So, that makes no sense. It's not as if they killed him as he was charging at them.

t1_duylux8	0.613700	*	For things unrelated to the campaign, yes.  This is in itself somewhat worrisome, as it shows a lack of scope for the investigation.  
t1_dunmc2m	0.202300	*	classical liberalism is libertarianism, you want progressice modern liberalism.  You want a system focused on helping people in need, not simply those who are already succeeding.

t1_duwg1zh	-0.584600	*	> He also extremely lacks in political and administrate experience.  That's because Navalny is more of an activist than a politician because Putin keeps him and his movement far away from power.

t1_duq7xxl	0.006200	*	You should stay in Russia then, since it's so wonderful.
t1_dua6ull	0.361200	*	No, it can't. Theoretically, maybe, but we have to respect the results of a referendum even if we don't like those results. That's a democracy.

t1_dugqxli	0.000000	*	Except the ones who benefit from the system the way it is don't want it to change. Hard to affect change when it's counter productive to the asshats who benefit from it.

t1_dutkt1f	0.000000	*	That's a good link.  The argument that legalization results in inflow of human traffic is sound. I was surprised to learn this.

t1_dudg6vl	0.659700	*	Yep. No sane wealthy Chinese will keep all his money in China. It's simply not safe from government shenanigans. Easiest way to get it out of the country is buying up real estate.
t1_dusoufm	0.325100	*	Running 2,000 of conduit, and proving power is pragmatic, but a wall is not? Youre not making a very good case.

t1_dunk522	-0.425500	*	But that's making the assumption that today's free press doesn't have their own biases, their own agendas, and isn't driven by profit. Media is in a HUGE conflict of interest position.

t1_duqamjl	-0.123200	*	To be fair, it is relevant if true. The problem with it is that it's 100% whataboutism and doesn't even attempt to right a wrong just because 'b-b-but Hillary'.

t1_dv20ixi	-0.599800	*	Call it a hunch, but I very much doubt you're asking because you want to hear a view other than your own.

t1_dua655g	-0.380400	*	So retarded that you'd be speaking German right now without us.
t1_dv35puk	0.440400	*	An extremely valid question. Especially considering Reddits history of banning subreddits before. There really is nothing to suggest that they wouldn't have treated this the same. 
t1_duztrxw	0.226300	*	So do you expect everyone else to just accept their malicious actions?

t1_dv0ri9h	-0.361200	*	Yep. It's protected by the first amendment. Pretty much the only thing you can't share is child pornography and illegally download things   Down vote me all you want, I'm still right. 
t1_dupozgv	0.599400	*	Can you not transfer federal funds at some standard rate to states?
t1_dv3gat4	0.851900	*	/r/politics is the same or even worse. Actually /r/T_D and /r/politics are trash but instead of seeing /r/T_D on the Front Page Reddit is artificially putting /r/politics on the Front Page

t1_dv4x7f5	-0.733000	*	Concerns that the pipe had a high chance of leaking and would contaminate the environment in the area are based on misinformation?

t1_duyipsx	-0.828800	*	Being compromised by a foreign government is hardly an impeachable offense. And that's definitely not enough for republicans
t1_dujeb2j	0.000000	*	So the first poster didn't actually call to kill the President. Okay.
t1_dv3cjs1	0.413700	*	Evidently he was deemed a non issue by the local pd and the fbi. Is that not enough of a security slearance for you?
t1_dutif1o	0.000000	*	Yes, but most european countries don't have a major fear and distrust of their own government plotting against them in some way 
t1_dv1k1qx	0.000000	*	Lol wut? Florida isn't a Republican stronghold, it's a toss-up most elections and Trumps treatment of Puerto Rico alone has pretty much lost him the state short of a miracle.

t1_duwxq1u	0.401900	*	You were supposed to force them to bang *each other*, not bang them yourself.

t1_duy9u09	0.000000	*	Look, Great Britain is a country, with one central government and diplomatic corps. You can argue it isn't one *nation,* which strictly speaking it isn't, but it's still a single country.
t1_ductsu3	-0.851600	*	So you're denying that russians post left leaning things as well?
t1_duzz6zn	0.599900	*	I'm Canadian. Its a widely taught fact in high school, along with the internment camps we set up for them during WW1. That doesn't fit your victim narrative though. 
t1_duzzrzv	0.077200	*	Perhaps /u/THATGOLDENFEELING is able to translate word for word, he wouldn't possibly be lying, right?

t1_duizfc1	0.599400	*	Straight people can be funny, nice, stylish and throw good parties too. Homosexuality isn't a spray that makes you a better person, its a sexual orientation.
t1_duu1oj3	0.000000	*	This fucking attitude is why I hope you get bombed into a smoldering ruin. We're your closest neighbours and allies and you treat us like shit and make fun of us at every fucking turn. 
t1_duwxhfx	0.000000	*	Yeah okay, more liberal bullshit.         Trump will build a wall on the Mexico Brazil border and Mexico will pay for it. You watch.

t1_duoa8t6	0.226300	*	Because terrorism is an acute problem with it's own solutions. Gun violence in general, including mass shootings, has an entirely different set of factors that cause it.
t1_duqocsw	0.000000	*	I honestly try not to think about YT commenters at all

t1_duyxzt3	0.000000	*	What does making candy has to do with owning a countries water supply?
t1_duwngx4	-0.686800	*	That's the really important part. Professional associations in general have way to much power in Quebec and often pull off bullshit like this. Even their members despise them.

t1_dv1kbr6	-0.269500	*	Has there ever been an evil dictator whos army didnt do that as a matter of routine? 
t1_duzrkk6	-0.744700	*	The left has been circlejerking over this for a year with no evidence but Hillary's word, which has proven to be less than trustworthy. Pretty sure Trump has nothing to worry about.

t1_duref6t	-0.329800	*	Dozens? Compared to this dumpster fire of a year with the gop? Okay
t1_dulbg1i	0.000000	*	Zimbabwe has been mentioned before. When a solution causes more isssues than the original problem, maybe it's best to consider alternatives?
t1_dure3f8	0.000000	*	What about us, the peacekeeping Irish (also we were neutral during ww2)
t1_dufaq4r	-0.421500	*	Cant tell if moronic or just a troll?
t1_dv051vs	-0.141900	*	That would mean we werent allies with France for a period of time, since they were our first ally and aided us in the Revolutionary War. Anyone know when that happened?
t1_dulztue	0.000000	*	I wonder what time of ship will be named after Trump.
t1_duza287	0.921300	*	It just seems like if you're wearing a pussy on your head you'd be a bit more desensitized to sexual openness. Not sure what him being white has to do with anything, though.

t1_duq8yjm	0.000000	*	Dark money refers to campaign contributions donated in a way in which they are very difficult to track. How is that a conspiracy theory?  *looks at profile*  Oh, joined 13 days ago. I see.
t1_dukc2q0	0.000000	*	We need the EPA to save the planet?  The EPA has always been useless.
t1_dv47zi6	0.000000	*	Muslim is not a superset of arab; there are non-muslim arabs, especially in Lebanon and Syria. It's a common misconception.
t1_duhf4hs	0.000000	*	If you don't mind me asking, are you teaching overseas or something else?
t1_durhj14	-0.790600	*	> civil war  Seems like bloodshed is the only way for these gun-nuts to see what these school shooting victims are going through.

t1_duadqyx	-0.932900	*	I don't see how that's relevant.
t1_duamv8p	0.000000	*	You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it.
t1_dv3bvge	0.930400	*	There are finite spots at universities. You either fill them based on merit OR on 'representation'. Which one is fairer for the individual and better for society?
t1_duiao5g	0.000000	*	I think 9 out of 10 economists say trickle down economics is a myth, and the 10th isn't an economist.

t1_dubo1w7	0.000000	*	Yeah, that part stands out as odd. Longstanding conflict between those two 'groups'. Although perhaps a mutual hatred of the west. 
t1_duskfns	0.000000	*	Of for fuck sake, then why even respond?
t1_dufgsiz	0.000000	*	And plenty of Africans.
t1_dulnrcm	0.872300	*	The poor blaming the poor for their problems.
t1_duhuou0	0.000000	*	The youth are probably just living off their parents. And as it's only 21% for adults altogether - it's entirely possible that a large percentage of them have spouses that do work.
t1_dux5gsf	0.636900	*	People say this all the time. Earth would not necessarily be fine. The transformation to a Venus-like planet devoid of life is a real possibility with dead oceans and a runaway greenhouse gas effect.
t1_dufu1sn	0.493900	*	READ your 10 page ticket, while asking yourself why the ticket has 10 pages of fine print. Not anti-cruise line, but remember you're not in Kansas anymore.

t1_dulxu55	-0.733400	*	Is it tyranny if it's what the people want?  Yes it is.  The majority cannot legitimately infringe the basic human rights of a minority.  Namely in this case, a trial in a court.
t1_duid13v	-0.153100	*	With a small loan of a million dollars, I'm pretty sure I could. Go back to /a/
t1_ducukng	0.631000	*	Yeah but with Democracy the people who are influenced the easiest by it get to vote.   If tweets are enough to topple a democracy then I don't see any value in democracy itself

t1_dv4ekl4	-0.908800	*	That's fine. Go for it. European exports 150 billion a year more to the US then vice versa. 
t1_dv06sic	0.000000	*	You answered your own question. Go look at how the Brits thought the US would be run. Common thought was the US would be begging to be a colony again.

t1_dv572ct	0.000000	*	I was just in Vegas 2 weeks ago, you're a liar.
t1_dv350ux	0.151300	*	I remember when someone had the top post on an announcement imploring the admins to fix their shit or this would happen.  Can't feel sorry for them if it leads to trouble.
t1_dv1wz5c	0.571900	*	But do you really expect the sort of people who blindly follow hype to understand statistic and cause and effect?

t1_dv48o50	0.002700	*	That's great. Mind if I ask roughly what area do the country it's in?  Also I was under the impression that no new contracts for FTTP were given out after Abbott came in. Am I wrong?
t1_duj0cpi	-0.401900	*	Much like how everyone here knows the NSA spies on you and that privacy is nonexistent, but don't care. Different cultures, same government bullshit.

t1_dubtdpc	-0.400700	*	Too expensive. We can just have all the lowest ranked soldiers eat the grass instead!
t1_dv10j4h	-0.359500	*	They let women walk down the street showing their face in SS Chicago. Can you say the same about Germany no go zones?
t1_duxnc19	0.718400	*	I have never heard that before. It's amazing what people will do to convince themselves that it's OK to just do what they want to do. Thanks for sharing. 
t1_duylcs0	0.540000	*	Because he is correct in saying that the US hasn't adequately compensated slaves, either, and only offered some meaningless words (which Japan has offered, too).

t1_dv0rlqe	-0.361200	*	You do realize that philosophy is basically the core of science? Philosophy is basically making sense of everything science told us and asking more questions for science to answer.

t1_duzwmn0	-0.102700	*	I'm not so sure, the west doesn't give much of a shit about Africa as is. The fact that a major city is about to run out of water isn't on too many headlines either.

t1_dundn1b	0.361200	*	The walking and eating/drinking thing. Really? That's kind of cool. Do you know why it's considered rude? Is it just plain old impolite?

t1_dugc6qi	0.000000	*	The law should be upheld. Then whether the law should be changed or not is a separate discussion.
t1_dv3dwtq	0.361200	*	Presumably because they invested in other alternatives to stifle the decline. Just a guess.  And in what world can a place like Iran be said to not have bordered on collapse lol?
t1_dv241yd	-0.381800	*	>This couldn't actually happen, right? > >*this actually happens but worse*  *Trump announces that he will move to dissolve the United States of America*

t1_dv0pciy	0.226300	*	The alternative in the US would be to change the constitution, so I think arming teachers is a reasonable compromise, if only because it is actually achievable with the next 20 years.

t1_dv5kjgu	0.000000	*	Nope. Nepotism is how Senators ensure they get rich. Any law that outlaws it will be defeated.
t1_dupvqjr	-0.361200	*	Yea no, maybe in Berlin Hamburg and Munich. But even there you can live off that. Arguably not feed a family of 4 alone though, but youd get benefits then.
t1_duqlc8x	0.000000	*	Was his place rent controlled?
t1_dv0ri9h	0.000000	*	Yep. It's protected by the first amendment. Pretty much the only thing you can't share is child pornography and illegally download things   Down vote me all you want, I'm still right.

t1_dv0nvga	0.000000	*	Well...the president of the country making a statement and setting a goal might be worth something somewhat.
t1_duc7zck	0.000000	*	It's not so much the loss of vegetation, as the loss of biodiversity. There's a ton of species (plant and animal) being wiped out. 
t1_dunmqj2	-0.421500	*	Are you seriously concerned about whether or not it is legal for a 17 yr old person to own the gun that he shoots up the school with?  Do you think that he is concerned with that?

t1_duzinse	-0.051600	*	Does Russia know that? 
t1_duyiqta	-0.057200	*	To be fair Trump isn't alone here. NYC and London real estate are the center of global money laundering. 
t1_duqauf1	-0.356600	*	Even then, though. Being able to launch a propaganda campaign to confuse dumb people doesn't make you a superpower; it's just going to make Russia even more of a pariah, with less global influence.

t1_duvylir	-0.077200	*	Your leg is already broken so lets keep hitting it with a hammer.  Just because shit's already fucked doesn't mean we should try to keep it from getting even more fucked.

t1_dueh8p5	0.542300	*	I'm guessing they don't expect anyone to ever honestly check that box, but I'm betting that not checking it when you do intend to commit a crime will count as another crime they can charge you with.

t1_dv1jusq	0.000000	*	I honestly can't believe people think the cold war never ended. Guarantee everyone saying that was born after 1991. The USSR literally doesn't exist anymore. The cold war ended.
t1_dv25qei	0.886600	*	No... she got preferential dnc fundraising activities and the dnc actively worked against Bernie   It it had been fair, Bernie would have won.

t1_duwnffc	-0.090000	*	That's also on the salary of a person who's worked likely 10 years out of med school (at least, probably a lot more in reality). What's the junior doctor pay like?

t1_dup9iw1	-0.696600	*	In any case, I think that violence and condemnations are not the information that should be presented by the media. If more love was spread, we would be a little closer to peace.

t1_dui15io	-0.549900	*	Ok, now the real problem: housing price increases, which tends to be several times that of real median growth rates.  CPI perhaps was not the best way of illustrating my point, I will admit that.
t1_dud4cyy	-0.401900	*	Well you only won 08 and 12 because Obama is black.../s
t1_dur94qp	-0.648600	*	Thats good.  Reactionary fear based constitution shredding gun control should be resisted by the adults in the room.

t1_dv4doc1	-0.476700	*	I was speaking more recently. I don't think the Russian oligarchs, the biggest threat to Russia's survival, are busy infighting among themselves, unless it's all positioning.

t1_dul9keb	-0.334100	*	Thanks! That comment actually kinda weirded me out, but I didn't want to cause an argument over it.
t1_duhw65f	0.000000	*	when has anyone cared about another persons buying and keeping their home?
t1_dun9ugp	0.000000	*	I would guess that glass would have issues when dropped or with hot water when washing (cracks easy)
t1_duohmfl	0.585900	*	It should be a crime to be such a stupid fuck.
t1_dv0ap83	0.000000	*	I think you mean ''Xanax''.
t1_dui7y6c	-0.762000	*	Why not go a step further and have a zero government world?
t1_dupsvzy	0.000000	*	No, his reply assumed I was republican.
t1_dunhnok	0.000000	*	You can't cut off eastern EU countries without cutting the rest of europe off. That's why there are building new pipelines such as nord stream.
t1_duwkz6y	0.000000	*	Is med school tuition the same amount as undergrad?
t1_dupzg9d	0.352700	*	Yes, but there is a reason they get those guns, a reason they have no laws, a reason to choose who to pick fights with. It's a puppet fight.
t1_dv1w6xe	-0.232100	*	This kind of elitism got Trump elected  Edit: to make things clear, I wasn't saying opposing pedophile was elitist. I was saying the snide comment about Alabama was elitist.
t1_dungu8w	0.944100	*	Ok then u have to hold Britain, Norway and basically every European country on a coast as we too have fished species to extinction and pretty recently too 
t1_dured2y	0.000000	*	u/Samtell_ is being an asshole and misrepresenting things
t1_dv34s2g	-0.525600	*	Yeah, but the plan was not to win. By winning, he (and those around him) lost. 
t1_duk0zf3	0.359500	*	Not to mention that Trump himself didn't do shit against it, denied it and tried and did interfere with the investigation several times.
t1_dufu8o1	-0.476700	*	All trained professionals.  Everyday you also put your life in the hands of teenage texters when driving. 
t1_dv0svkl	-0.526700	*	Im pretty sure thats a quote but forgot who said it
t1_duuzqut	0.000000	*	Yeah I dont know if Im comfortable with a pharmacist making those decisions.
t1_dupxw9b	-0.612400	*	Maybe they just need more thoughts and prayers.
t1_dur77mc	0.510600	*	Tbf it IS pretty easy. Then again I didn't buy Venezuelan crypto, so that might be part of it.  Not really that confortable here in Brazil, but we get by.
t1_dudqysx	0.316400	*	It certainly should be a thing. Medicine shouldn't really be for corporate profits.
t1_dv2eg8r	0.401900	*	Really? CNN is worldwide. I don't know of a lot of people outside the US who watch Fox News. 
t1_dutmj3z	-0.840200	*	So there you go, you just admitted vaccines=shit
t1_duqjgtc	-0.440400	*	>act of war  Dude, what are you smoking? Are we gonna nuke China because of the 50-cent party while we are at it?
t1_dubom8a	-0.549900	*	I swear that was a 90s thing. Idk why. But my Filipino friends complained about being mistaken for or compared to Mexicans all the time. The hell was that about...
t1_duz5mg3	0.812600	*	That's fair. Still more than 50 years ago though. 
t1_dv3vrgp	-0.241100	*	Include me in the screenshot.

t1_dv00bsh	0.000000	*	I hate the phrase institutional racism. What institution is racist? No one can ever tell me. 
t1_duu8v8m	0.690800	*	The country is less than 5% Afrikaners... and its very obvious why they would hate the ANC, taking away their rights and redistributing their wealth unfairly.
t1_due0mxq	0.585900	*	What peninsula ?
t1_dugbvoc	-0.488500	*	I just voted for Trump because I didn't like Hillary's face and I thought both of them would fuck shit up equally.  I don't regret anything. 
t1_dupqkx2	0.608800	*	I see all that government planning is identical to worker control. 
t1_dullzvd	-0.723900	*	Wasn't that just the Belgian king and everybody was appalled at the time? What about the millions of people mao killed through incompetence? The communist Chinese are no saints.
t1_dui35d1	0.459400	*	Singapore has yet to become a socialist paradise like China, yes.
t1_dun39ra	-0.848100	*	including war deaths, yes. 11 million were from the holocaust.

t1_dunz8z6	0.258400	*	LOL, with that rational you could tie it all back to WW1 and the fall of the Ottoman Empire. 
t1_dv4wghk	-0.859100	*	>have really no idea what she mightve actually done to qualify for being charged with alleged crimes.  Benghazi obv /s

t1_duecot1	0.757900	*	He is their golden boy even
t1_dut9zw8	0.420100	*	Well, it's probably best compared to Mormonism. New prophet and new book. Most Christians I know don't regard Mormons as Christian. 
t1_duiipbe	-0.493900	*	They all sounds like Hugh Jackman though, but that's a plus in my books ;)
t1_dulpevh	0.361200	*	It's always the people you least expect that have death squads...  Except Hitler. But I don't think he was trying to be subtle about it.

t1_duhi49s	-0.709600	*	I think it's only true in the US. In most EU countries, firearms are not a common sight.
t1_dualavq	0.807000	*	You know how many foods are shaped like cocks? THE BEST KINDS!  
t1_dv02kpz	-0.502300	*	That actually is what it should mean isn't it? 
t1_durc47b	-0.802000	*	You are missing the point. The Venezualan government is not stupid enough to antagonize and start a war with a nation like the US or China over foreign aid provided.
t1_dut7fqn	0.812600	*	Great guy. Brilliant businessman. Wonderful father. Doesn't even drink.
t1_dui7dsy	0.476300	*	I saw this movie, it was called 'Trading Places.' 
t1_duk2a0g	0.000000	*	Lol you were never on the left if you think Democrats are on too far on the left. Laughable. 
t1_duwzu41	-0.669700	*	Yup, I tell people all the time that alcohol will fuck you up. It's in the top 3 the most dangerous drugs but since it's so readily available and lots of people use it, it's ok.
t1_ducls1q	0.542300	*	How exactly are you going to fight back?
t1_dudglpf	0.775000	*	So is that what you believe? That 300,000 Americans didn't have a strong enough opinion about Hillary or Trump already that some tweets changed their minds? 
t1_duppc4k	0.493900	*	No it wouldn't. Doubleing their current capabilities would still put them behind France and the UK. 
t1_dunpogo	0.000000	*	Yep look at Obama...Dude was in bed with the big banks and wall street but gets a pass from a majority of Liberals because he was A nice guy and speaks eloquently...  Its bullshit.
t1_dv0qaq0	0.000000	*	Nope, actually there isn't. They test for that over several decades. 
t1_dv44mff	0.769300	*	Do you really expect a journalist to know the difference? 
t1_dv1299x	-0.680800	*	> use of terrorism propaganda  But she was using it *to show how terrible they are*... that's not at all in the same category as terrorists using their own propaganda.
t1_duuxtef	-0.717700	*	Can't we send the kids to prisons instead? They did associate with drug users. 
t1_dv34s2g	0.000000	*	Yeah, but the plan was not to win. By winning, he (and those around him) lost. 
t1_dv1016h	0.636900	*	No shit.  Europe collectively has the worst track record for the last 300 years.  Would not be great for world peace if one of those countries was a superpower again.
t1_durggwr	-0.851900	*	That's a bold claim.  The details are the horrific parts, but the bodycount doesn't even approach hitler.
t1_dv0uu9o	0.000000	*	What a fantastic idea! Rule Britannia! 
t1_duren0k	0.273200	*	In theory, yes. In practice, it would be so difficult that it's basically impossible. You'd need 3/4ths of states to agree on the change. 
t1_dv364hc	-0.051600	*	I have literally no idea what you wrote that for.
t1_dv3cnx6	-0.128000	*	>the Senate being unwilling to convict.  What should be zero tolerance is now the circus.   
t1_dux4onq	0.597500	*	Then you're what's preventing the world moving forward. Why not just respect everyone? What you said was hurtful. 
t1_duvbqq6	-0.823500	*	What part of Slovakia was occupied by Russia? 
t1_dufhpf5	0.000000	*	Curiosity on your wording: Our Kenyans.  Do you operate a shelter? Or did you just meant it as The Kenyans I/my community has known over the years?  Thank you. Pure linguistic interest, here.
t1_dudz0e3	0.000000	*	I promise you theyve tried all the options available to them and theyre still taking this medication because thats the best option. Dont try and give medical advice to people with chronic pain.

t1_dud87u7	0.000000	*	lol so that means that the idiots that go to the Trump is NOT my president marches are literally russian puppets. that's hilarious.
t1_dupiqtd	-0.659700	*	I'd say it's a side effect more than the problem. The problem is our 2 party system.

t1_duq9f4x	-0.765000	*	The article literally says the opposite of what you said

t1_duvfcm2	-0.897100	*	Same with people in DC, and the same logic. Tell someone it is hurting the ocean and environment, the response is that the ocean is so big and this is so little, what harm could there really be? 
t1_ducz37h	-0.177900	*	It's called accelerationism. Look it up.
t1_duln99x	0.458800	*	That's why the dems want open borders.  MS13 will do what Americans won't.

t1_duqay0f	0.000000	*	Alright then my bad I completely misinterpreted your comment. 
t1_dugvbve	-0.525500	*	Nah Im fixed just like the Democratic national convention 
t1_dugqjva	0.440400	*	That's not how our election works lol   You can become president and not win the majority of American votes. But I know you know that. So i'll just leave my comment and continue on my way

t1_duuguck	0.000000	*	Are you saying we should set the president on fire because he would just regenerate from normal attacks?

t1_dusm91h	-0.381800	*	The UN is not a company, being able to completely drown out poorer countries because they can't afford to buy relevance would destroy its credibility.
t1_duno5i9	0.421500	*	I'm not blaming him at all, just pointing out how they don't hold him to the same standards as Trump. Obama and Trump could do the same exact thing and the reaction would be immensely different.

t1_dv478ts	0.351900	*	Stupid too since fiber will set the nation up for the next hundred or so years, just replace the nodes. Copper is so close to dying and people steal it due to scrap value.

t1_duskvlx	0.868900	*	Why even write sadly? That sub is also so utterly biased they are basically useless.  edit: Also LOL about the downvotes. You gotta be delusional to not see it's a pure eco chamber.
t1_dugnu3n	0.304700	*	People voted Trump because they agreed with more of what he said than Hillary. He said some very icky things, but Hillary, to them, was ickier.  And so he was elected.

t1_dukbqvk	0.000000	*	That has nothing to do with the question that was asked.  You earned yourself a whoosh as well my friend
t1_dua6gkd	0.612400	*	Importing stuff from Japan without bothering with fees and taxes? Sweet.

t1_dug9x3g	0.709600	*	I agree, Israel should embrace diversity as it has always shown to be a strength. Israel should take in many more refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
t1_duvcb8o	0.296000	*	Agree but you link is not working on mobile. 
t1_duyijnp	0.000000	*	Anyone can if the matter pertains to them. In this case it's Trump's own verified account.

t1_dv3c2w0	0.585900	*	You are probably right. I don't know why the EU targets jeans, motorcycles and bourbon. There must be a reason. Are these products made in swing states?

t1_durso16	-0.709600	*	Pretty sure the US could have negotiated an end without nuking the cities, given Japan was willing to return to the home islands and demilitarize and hold war crimes trials in one of the negotiations.
t1_duv99z2	0.077200	*	A meaningless number since miles and feet are used to measure different things and have unconnected origins. Miles are divided the same way metric units are, decimally.

t1_duh57eh	-0.141500	*	Here's the thing. Trump tried to fire Mueller last year and got rebuffed by his own staff. My personal pet theory is that Trump has tried to fire Mueller in earnest but has been rebuffed legally.

t1_dv37i3o	0.840200	*	I said Russian or Naive.  Obviously this looks like naive, but you continue to peddle bullshit conservative talking points. 
t1_duwnpkt	0.000000	*	I understand that, it's still a silly rule. It's indicative that parts of the system aren't working as intended and nobody will put their heads together to fix it.

t1_dv4q273	0.361200	*	> Don't infantilize her... she's just as corrupt as he is.  That doesn't invalidate what he said. She, corrupt or not, still needs to maintain an image. Having a loser for a husband hurts that image.

t1_dumm587	0.831600	*	Except his refusal to enforce the stricter sanctions voted on by senate and congress.  So they could have it worse.

t1_duxfidh	-0.340000	*	I think thats the problem. Every person I encounter who is vocally pro-cannabis is the stereotypical useless stoner. Thus, based on my sample size, all weed users are useless stoners.

t1_dv0omus	0.309400	*	Well, yea. It's our right to bear arms that protects our freedom of speech.  What's happening here is the French government is restricting freedom of speech by threat of gun.

t1_duymr6f	-0.827100	*	Nazis aren't born, they're made. The only way to keep Nazis from making more Nazis is to make them too afraid to voice their views publicly.
t1_duqpavy	0.588300	*	You're trying really hard to push a narrative here. Yes, nothing to do with him is correct. The charges are from before he worked for Trump... but DAE impeach?

t1_dur81l3	-0.739100	*	Easy enough for many of us to joke because Venezuelans were warned, repeatedly, of what they would face under the current/former leaders. They didnt listen so there they are in a terrible situation.

t1_duen5yx	0.153100	*	Ding ding ding. You engineer things so human error doesn't cause deaths. It's pretty much the entire point of the field now. Make 5hings that work and aren't easy for people to kill themselves with. 
t1_duwsoa8	-0.510600	*	>  But Im curious as to why you think wed be immune to extinction?  Because pygmies, eskimos, opposable thumbs and so on and so forth.   More questions? 
t1_dunp6mf	-0.648600	*	> If you attempt to attack police or military personnel, they have the right to defend themselves.  If they have removed you as a threat, do they have the right to keep beating you to a pulp?

t1_dv0xo5v	0.686700	*	haha, the guy's username is a string of 11 random numbers that was created 5 days ago. Also, hyperbole always weakens your argument, friend.
t1_dun6rr7	-0.870900	*	You're absolutely right getting rid of guns has not reduced the amount of violent crime. What changing the weapon has done however is made it more difficult for those loons to kill loads of people.

t1_dv07p6v	0.839200	*	I'm okay with paying for it, but would prefer if it were paid for via taxation. Everyone deserves to be able to enjoy our parks, regardless of disposable income.

t1_dujcoyu	0.000000	*	Then your thinking is backward. One of them acts as a female, therefore this is the opposite of manliness.
t1_dulf5od	0.361200	*	Also, literally 100% of his sex partners are people who will agree to have sex with condomless men.  Good luck with the roulette.

t1_duz1et6	0.000000	*	I lived there. Russia definitely has influence there, but at a price. Russia has to provide discounts on natural gas/oil to have things go the way it wants.

t1_duwkqgd	0.000000	*	Supply and demand set price. Pay more in rural areas and more doctors will go there. The reality is it's usually the opposite with lower wages in rural areas.

t1_dv4ub4e	0.731100	*	Ehh, FDR got the ball rolling on a lot of progressive policies a couple decades earlier than that, but the signing of the civil rights act was pretty much the last nail in the coffin.

t1_dutb1o0	0.226300	*	> Tradition? It's the 22nd amendment. It has nothing to do with tradition.  It was pure tradition until FDR screwed it up, the 22nd amendment was made because of him.

t1_dud6e24	0.000000	*	This is just sad. He replies honestly and politely and you immediately devolve to bizarre insults. And you wonder why no one likes to engage you T_D types.

t1_duf48k9	-0.318200	*	Eh, conservatives get downvoted in r/politics, but not banned. It's just the demographics of the site lean left.  t_d outright bans anyone not on the narrative.

t1_dupg8o6	0.381800	*	Cant tell if its because Mexico is doing better or because the US has been that stagnant
t1_dv4zes0	0.077200	*	Good thing he wasn't elected to the position then.

t1_dur6yz1	-0.536700	*	Good work fellow redditor. I am always (rightly, I think) sceptical of reporting by MEMO, so when they actually have credible claims, they need to do better work showing their sources!

t1_duld1h4	-0.151100	*	There have been travel warnings issued for European countries due to the increased risk of terrorist incidents. Maybe not at the same scale as Afghanistan, but Europe is arguably unsafe as well.., 
t1_dv4rnz9	-0.102700	*	And Trumps trying to scuttle funding for a new tunnel between New Jersey and NYC. An infrastructure project NY desperately needs.

t1_duieha4	0.685800	*	What is that like 100 million total? So that's like a single F-35. I'm glad you are making such deep cuts. 
t1_dv0j5iz	0.102700	*	I could be wrong here but it looks like it is more than frowned upon. Could she not go to jail for this? 
t1_dudqyre	0.226300	*	Yeah but the Ferrari is way more fun. We're not talking about oxycodone and ibuprofen.
t1_dun5pon	0.658100	*	In the case of haze, surgical masks do nothing. You need a mask with a N95 filter which surgical masks dont have.

t1_duwngx4	0.718400	*	That's the really important part. Professional associations in general have way to much power in Quebec and often pull off bullshit like this. Even their members despise them.
t1_dv2vu9a	0.308900	*	Oh I'm in the boat that a corporation isn't a person and  shouldn't be treated as one, but since they are legally equivalent to a person in the States we might as well go all the way. 
t1_dui7unl	0.771700	*	the problem is when you have so much money that you are put in the 91% tax bracket, you have enough money not to pay the 91%
t1_due5v5o	-0.273200	*	Food shortages are caused by capitalist sabotage, there is proof that they drive away trucks full of food, the same thing happened in Chile under Allende. 
t1_duj0cpi	-0.956900	*	Much like how everyone here knows the NSA spies on you and that privacy is nonexistent, but don't care. Different cultures, same government bullshit.

t1_duiy9vz	0.872100	*	But then you have to consider the non-major cities in the UK too. UK has its own countryside with a lower QoL that would compare to parts of the Midwest.

t1_dup7ote	0.690800	*	No definitely not. Its also a story about a guy who defeats a made up civilization via wooden horse antics though, so maybe you don't need to be historically accurate about myths
t1_dv4jon4	0.942900	*	Yeah but interestingly the main character rejects the whole peace thing, and through the game you instead build a mercenary army which includes child soldiers and nuclear weapons.

t1_duyi3f2	-0.975200	*	They even admitted she was guilty, then didn't press charges. A waste of money in a much different direction.
t1_dv1w6xe	-0.440400	*	This kind of elitism got Trump elected  Edit: to make things clear, I wasn't saying opposing pedophile was elitist. I was saying the snide comment about Alabama was elitist.

t1_duphyha	-0.361200	*	That's false. They are in a pretty big leader in the EU, which like it or not is an extremely large western market.

t1_dv3c2w0	0.000000	*	You are probably right. I don't know why the EU targets jeans, motorcycles and bourbon. There must be a reason. Are these products made in swing states?
t1_dubott7	-0.648600	*	Wtf that is entirely untrue. What nightmare dimension are you living in?
t1_dv4bfjt	-0.102700	*	It's because we're in the Southern hemisphere and things are opposites. So Liberal is conservative, water is beer, your girlfriend is your wife, etc. etc...

t1_dugpw6h	-0.380400	*	That's the idea behind it but in practice it just means that Ohio and Florida choose the president.
t1_dujk6gv	-0.897700	*	Oh that might be true but I just don't see any right media in there. I guess there are just different definitions of balanced.

t1_dusoc5h	-0.812600	*	..how?
t1_dv489fj	0.318200	*	> brutal stay in prison  Sounds like you also support the Sharia. What about cutting his hands off?

t1_duguh8n	-0.840200	*	Maybe I'm a lil naive but each time I see the Russians they just mean the Kremlin, not the whole population. The OP might have a point, Russia is shown to have a hand in racial tensions online.

t1_dua5kj2	0.000000	*	Damn... you make it sound like those are real strict regulations... when it really isnt and sounds very loose.
t1_dujth42	-0.396200	*	So effectively it's a government panel saying, ehh fuck it, he's not worth it great to know that the government now has the power to decide innocent kids are no longer worth keeping alive.
t1_duabue0	0.401900	*	You mean with the emphasis on the second syllable?
t1_dv33n6c	0.296000	*	I wasn't talking about the posts. I was talking about the design. The Trump layer that sits on top of the page as you scroll, the Trump as Napoleon, The Red White and Blue everything.
t1_dusqzl1	-0.054700	*	People were sure that WW2 would never happen, because of how economically dependent countries had become on eachother.  Right up until the last day.

t1_duldgji	0.568800	*	Can you imagine if the rest of the world had to do a 'project the US national colors' thing every time there was a mass shooting?  It'd look like the US had conquered the world in a few weeks.

t1_dumlib7	-0.528300	*	Are you OK with a school letting kids skip in order to attend a Trump rally?  Why is one OK but not the other? 
t1_dv3akv0	0.000000	*	I struggled to find the words in my mind, thanks! Now I can have my Friday.  Sister does DNA cloning of things for cancer research. I figure, one could use some free roaming ivory 
t1_dum82wd	0.000000	*	Probably because he thought it was nonsensical or didn't feel it accurately reflected what he was trying to communicate. That's ok isn't it?

t1_dv1sa99	0.000000	*	Im just here so I dont get tariffd
t1_duqmbfo	0.680800	*	Thats not how it works, nor even close to it. Your opinion is not fact.

t1_dupb5md	0.440400	*	> [...] we have empathy. [...]  As hard as it sounds, I think the concept of empathy became quite foreign and therefore weird to a great portion of the US populace....
t1_dujk1vs	0.226300	*	So at worst he's too trusting. But that doesn't make him guilty of any crime. And again Obama believed Putin too when he was president.

t1_dusjpei	0.000000	*	Step 1:  make a law in the USA that taxes remittance.    Step 2: Thats it.  Whats Mexico going to do about it?
t1_duyjhwf	-0.852300	*	They saw Hillary, someone who had been in politics before, and Trump, someone who hadn't. It's easy to see why they supported him. Dismissing them as stupid is just going to lead to a repeat.
t1_dulylww	-0.510600	*	No. that, however should have been laughing emoji, followed by thoughtful emoji and then by crying emoji.
t1_duf3tdk	0.493900	*	None, really that I can think of.  They're all pretty left.  However, when I say LEFT I mean true Liberal left not that Commie bullshit you guys have going on down in the USA.

t1_dut3s1b	-0.919300	*	IMHO, a country such as prominent as America  Why are you phrasing it so weird? Do you even live in America?
t1_dunjo7c	0.921100	*	I prefer Russia without a question. Look at how many countries the US invaded on the last decade to install puppet regimes and how many times Russia did the same.

t1_duegefv	0.709600	*	Panda diplomacy is a thing
t1_durz7l7	0.000000	*	So youre saying that antifa, who are anti-fascists that protest against fascist asswipes, need to be put down? Even though dipshits confuse anarchists and the black bloc with antifa all the time?

t1_dullzvd	0.000000	*	Wasn't that just the Belgian king and everybody was appalled at the time? What about the millions of people mao killed through incompetence? The communist Chinese are no saints.
t1_dv560c1	0.000000	*	With all this IQ talk, remember when he seriously bragged about doing good on a test meant solely to determine if a person was mentally ill in January?
t1_dv4m8yz	0.000000	*	Another good example as to why we should be looking for a better way, is it not?
t1_dunmv42	-0.855500	*	Oh right, so here, they are using it kind of like a slang, right? Like Oppa to someone older. Calling her little sibling to kind of emphasize the inequality?
t1_dunpapc	-0.907400	*	With your shortsightedness and ignorance you really don't deserve the lube. Eight years of Trump should cure that.
t1_dv0kun3	0.432900	*	Do they not use a synthetic caine like procaine or benzocaine?
t1_dufwlrh	-0.698800	*	You can't guarantee a clean shot from a moving vehicle. So you are more likely to hit the animal in another spot and cause it to suffer.
t1_duyi8xw	0.873800	*	But these have to happen to have more people cooperating on same issues.  If you stop doing that you will have less people on your side. Does it make sense to you?
t1_dv4868r	0.401900	*	Do u mean Mr Broadband?
t1_dujlc6p	-0.318200	*	Or that one guy who murdered his dad for being too liberal.
t1_duopxdj	0.000000	*	The pun is de*kaffir*nated. Because kaffir is a South African slur for a black person.

t1_dum7qtu	-0.202300	*	Each one has more power than almost any country's air force in the world. Each.  America is OP. Rumour is they're getting nerfed in the next patch though.
t1_duopy5e	0.000000	*	I don't think Russian diplomats use crack. All my money is on their use of powder and local prostitutes. Nice job keeping track of your tax dollars, Moscow. 
t1_dulcjp1	0.000000	*	Just like our airforce. Just that we won't fly the ones without proper maintenance, resulting in pretty much all our airforce being permanently grounded.

t1_dv2ievi	0.000000	*	Good luck getting Americans to do anything after you tell them they are doing it wrong.  We'll continue to do it wrong just to spite you.  Sometimes we'll see if we can do it wronger.

t1_dudr7h6	0.000000	*	Likely patents, trade agreements, or even who got to the FDA first.

t1_duphzfy	0.000000	*	Well yes, but it's based on a real thing. Back in the late 70s-early 80s it was discovered that the US military was spending outrageous sums for ordinary things like the aforementioned.
t1_dv0pbli	-0.715200	*	We all share this planet. Beheadings are a thing. The fact that they don't occur in my neighborhood doesn't make them any less real.
t1_dubyicl	0.783500	*	That's a hell of a lot of assumptions.  Nobody knows the future, apart from people who want the EU to stick together. They are all psychics. Weird that is... 
t1_dudqoob	-0.177900	*	Pretty sure the last sentence was sardonic.
t1_dujteif	-0.332100	*	Um. What the fuck do you think this is all about?

t1_duz2nlj	0.401900	*	Things have been so weird that I'm not sure he will actually be indicted and ousted. I hope Mueller can bring a case together but this has been one hell of a testing experience. 
t1_duq4q75	0.226300	*	That would be *nose clams*, for the uninitiated.
t1_dv36mr5	0.296000	*	Hey, if you post what you really believe, not amount of downvotes or backlash matters.
t1_dv149sa	0.361200	*	Honestly it probably has less to do with ISIS being bad and more to do with the public distaste for Le Pen and her party. This charge is just an excuse to punish her for something.
t1_dupbh72	0.000000	*	And that is a argument for what?
t1_dv0n47s	0.226300	*	Well you got 10 diffrent flavors of pop tarts...so theres that 
t1_duoppjl	-0.686200	*	Or maybe he knew they were already gonna be busted so he decided to save face?
t1_duytl2j	-0.267100	*	lol you actually have no clue who Mueller is at all, do you?  like not even the slightest.  
t1_dufora8	0.000000	*	i'm not sure if you're kidding, but i think he was talking about search-history-based algorithmic targeted advertising

t1_dujsdvo	0.492600	*	We are not united as states any longer, we are competing for resources and living under different sets of laws.    Public trust in the United States is dissolving.

t1_dup7lkj	0.000000	*	Actually, British aristocracy are less likely to use French words. Eg. loo is upperclass, toilet is middleclass.

t1_duq0ie2	0.794100	*	...You wrote America does it to other countries, should we all just put sanctions on ourselves.  Why would a New Zealander with so-so grasp on English defend Trump using whataboutism?
t1_dv5kh1f	0.000000	*	Trump and every single republican. So about 50% of your country
t1_dubajac	-0.271600	*	He's trying to bring attention to the more important words in the sentence.
t1_duuhfmp	-0.440400	*	Sounds like the same ignorant argument whenever a non-white is reminded of being racist. Typically their argument is something like Oh but that's impossible because only whites can be racist.  -.-
t1_dusysjw	0.000000	*	always check the history: need to know if it's one of the russians currently raping your country before I reply

t1_duor087	-0.592700	*	We are going to suffer from the Trump administration decades from now, its not going to be easily undone. Think about the damage to the judicial system already. All those unqualified judges...

t1_duczyty	0.000000	*	And yet its pretty easy to tell that Im a random dude who isnt on some political rampage. Id much rather have a discussion about my comment, since thats whats relevant.

t1_dujjuwt	-0.557400	*	Someone listened to carlin... he actually is pretty correct in the original statement, but it is hard not to add more context as a nerd.
t1_dum59gi	0.542300	*	Yeah, I'm just joking. You can't properly compare safety of American schools to safety of Nigerian schools in the country side. 
t1_ducs4b2	0.726900	*	Posting on Twitter is Russian involvement? I thought this was focused on a DNC hack not FEC violations.
t1_dugr2zy	0.361200	*	Wait, I must've missed that. Why did he hide in the bushes?

t1_duyqyvv	-0.536700	*	To W's credit, he realized he was about to give up a major soundbyte, and he caught himself right before doing something extremely stupid. There is no evidence that Trump possesses this capability.

t1_dun1z29	0.000000	*	Frog or not, it doesn't change the fact your country has raped the world, and now you're the ones getting raped. Not fun, is it? It should actually be worse, which is a shame.
t1_duilp26	-0.757900	*	What an empathetic person you are, with an amazing grasp of international diplomacy and potential outcomes.   Maybe you should run for president?
t1_dur85bj	0.000000	*	The 2nd amendment doesn't give an individual the right to own and keep firearms. It mentions armed militias.

t1_dv38l4q	0.000000	*	Ok....so you admit you got to post there. Thanks for proving me right.  As for your ban, I am guessing you broke a subreddit rule.

t1_dui58i7	0.910300	*	Yeeh I know an I am sorry. But seriously some of these comments man. It's the kind of shit that give you a bad name. Again I am sorry, it was a shitty to thing to say and I wish I hadn't now. 
t1_dujk39a	0.440400	*	Oh, wow - how is that sustainable?  Who would want to even go into medicine under those conditions?
t1_dupg3c8	0.802000	*	I mean, exclusions or not in both American media and daily lives military service is glorified more than anything else I can imagine other than maybe football.

t1_dv08fuc	0.784500	*	I would say comparing it to modern speech, this is arguatively better than I have a dream speech by Dr. King
t1_duvwq91	-0.401900	*	Unnamed anonymous sources from Axios, actually. Which is a bit better. Neither Axios nor Vanity Fair has a reputation for fake news, even if Vanity Fair has a clearly lefty editorial bias.
t1_dv0rxhc	0.401900	*	You can't drop something from orbit with gravity.  Its already falling.  It must slow down with either retro rockets or another outside force.

t1_dupfz2y	0.878300	*	Serious question: why does America import the drugs instead of producing them themselves? In other words, what makes Mexico a better place to run a drug operation than the US?
t1_dudpnv9	0.000000	*	What would you suggest as a replacement and how do you suppose we get to it peacefully? 
t1_dv2vptf	0.421500	*	I hope youre being sarcastic, otherwise that kind of thinking is dangerous and divisive

t1_duq6ay3	-0.724400	*	Yeah and a good portion of your family members are telling you how much they like the way your bathroom smells. 
t1_dudp8dm	-0.340000	*	Yeah those modern nations could do much better with a free market. I know it seems like heaven there compared to that US, but it can be MUCH better.

t1_duf6p0c	0.000000	*	Stations in Canada aren't polarized like they are in the US. CBC gives Trudeau flak when he does shit, and they were quick to agree with Harper when he did things right.

t1_dumomg7	-0.493900	*	Here is an actual report that isn't overly editorialized like your source which fails to compare CCW holder crime rates to national averages https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814691
t1_duy3xy5	0.000000	*	Lol yeah and last year Republicans were the biggest supporters of free trade agreements. Opinions change quick. This isn't about 2012 Republicans this is about 2017/2018 Republicans.

t1_duh5v84	0.501700	*	But that squandered money doesn't make it to you, it just goes to other rich people. 
t1_durhpmq	0.750000	*	Systematic genocide and the deaths of 10 million sure sound worse. But I hate debating which tyrannical regime was worse. 
t1_dugqdh5	-0.735100	*	As if they weren't a mile behind to begin with. There's a reason they lost the Cold War. 
t1_duzw2cf	-0.979200	*	The Iraq invasion, regardless to how you feel about it, was about Iraq not complying with UN requirements for weapons inspections. Saddam said he had WMD, and the U.S. believed him.

t1_duj5aq6	-0.883400	*	No, they have a database to keep track of what they owe you, it's just that your money is also in the same pile as everyone else's. When you want to withdraw, they take your share from the big pile.

t1_dv1qq68	-0.458800	*	They mark up all of their costs.  They may buy steel at $700 per ton, but they charge an additional 20% ($140).  Now they're buying at $900 per ton and charging an additional $180.

t1_duxrbxs	0.202300	*	> Are we forgetting that this implies that men cannot control sexual urges if women expose their hair?  Isn't that the purpose of most clothing laws in America as well? Most places ban public nudity. 
t1_dv0b7gk	-0.735100	*	That may be true. And they'll have to go back to moving around a lot. I'm sure that's what they're doing in Zimbabwe.

t1_duw4lgv	0.421500	*	Usually not that cold. Most of the time its between -5 to 0 degrees. That's why my hands are frozen to the phone. I live here now.
t1_dv1raod	-0.789000	*	Which is why Europe decided it would be a good idea to band together into a common market. Their economic leverage is greater than the sum of its parts.
t1_dv354rl	-0.720300	*	That's how it is for registered bots I think, but there's no restriction if you pretend to be a real person.

t1_dufi03r	0.542300	*	Sure, but any effect they have on the Icelandic economy is minimal at best.  There isn't even a synagogue here, as far as I know.

t1_dugamjt	-0.202300	*	You're the one making it weird. It's my son, of course I care about his reproductive future. And since I have had all these discussions, I have come to view this subject quite a bit differently.

t1_ducugi5	-0.250000	*	Same.  I've no idea why they went from an open platform that I gladly used to watch where they can serve me ads to a closed system that I couldn't buy into even if I wanted.  So I streamed.

t1_dud160f	0.726900	*	This indictment may be a trap set for Trump. He'll admit to stuff because he's unwitting and then they simply have to prove he knew all along (which they likely can already do)

t1_dui7r1d	0.750600	*	The point though, is why do you think you can just take away their money? Should they be able to do the same to you? Ownership of personal property is an important tenet of Western society.
t1_dv1khtu	0.551100	*	It isnt retarded. How is it fair to the rest of the country if 5 cities control who is president. It is there to make sure all the regions of America are represented or well get another secession.

t1_duo5inm	0.000000	*	Yeah. It happens all the time. The Syrian Government doesn't want an uprising, if an amnesty means that fighters will put down their guns and go back to work then that works for everyone

t1_duyrzct	-0.778300	*	Electronic elections are unlikely to ever go away. What's more likely is an increase in security.
t1_dunsthu	-0.700300	*	Its almost as if they wanted to terrorize their citizens. We should come up with a name for people that do that. Something like terrorizers.

t1_duavuro	-0.153100	*	Yeah but if theyre caught covering the name, the opposition has a field day. If they simply remove the snow, they can just say they were doing their jobs and deny any political motivation

t1_dv33119	-0.273700	*	I used to subscribe to conspiracy. There would sometimes be some obvious politically motivated stuff, but there was also a lot of fun stuff about UFOs and whatnot. They changed in a hurry.
t1_dv11wkr	0.000000	*	proverbial you then I guess.   point stands that when you elect an idiot with a bunch of angry sound bytes rather than a clear policy directive - the results are on you and your group.

t1_dud3x3x	0.685800	*	All you gotta do is say No, I promise your doctor is not going to fire you while your baby is crowning ;)  Also these are good things to talk about with your OB beforehand, in your birth plan.

t1_duhrhwm	0.000000	*	I must have misunderstood what you were saying
t1_dubipi3	0.077200	*	Yup. The Russians simply want to muddy the waters. The truth loses it's potency when there are multiple versions of the truth.
t1_dujqdd3	-0.900300	*	I knew there was interference. I was just surprised Trump admitted it.
t1_duj1f1q	-0.217400	*	Well, some Russian people care, but they tend to get into accidents and shit.

t1_dups60t	-0.318200	*	I'm not sure I fully understand this. I mean surely illegals can't vote?   Honest question btw, I'm not from the U.S.

t1_dudnr0j	0.690800	*	It's not even regulating, it's just bulk purchasing, which is economy of scale, which IS capitalism... 
t1_dv33n6a	0.000000	*	We need an anti-bot bot. Look for same posts word for word on different threads, subs and if found, mark them as bots and when see again, down-vote the posts.
t1_due2yt2	0.957900	*	So you could have the exact same effect by taking both but taking the naproxen later by some factor?

t1_duhm0i3	-0.913600	*	Those problems are actually pretty difficult and time intensive to solve. You can be angry, but it won't necessarily get things done faster just because you want to think that it can be.

t1_dv18e8r	-0.227900	*	Yes. When the workers feed the queen those small doses add up. It would be far better for the bees if the insecticide killed the bee in the field at time of exposure.
t1_duamwgz	-0.102700	*	*Just* a million dollars worth of bribes. No biggie.   I guess we've really become desensitized to corruption.
t1_duylyh9	0.432900	*	Yes we should have a world government that tells people what they can and can not teach their children. Sounds like a great idea.

t1_duqk4ax	-0.296000	*	People in this chain taking your words way too literally.  Dude just wants to know why they would be lowering the sentence due to it being a federal offence.
t1_duq861l	0.000000	*	>We want to defend the bill of rights! Well except the 2nd one.  The ACLU reads the 2nd Amendment [starting with the Well regulated militia part](https://www.aclu.org/other/second-amendment).

t1_duavuro	0.923100	*	Yeah but if theyre caught covering the name, the opposition has a field day. If they simply remove the snow, they can just say they were doing their jobs and deny any political motivation

t1_dv4r0ra	0.117900	*	Yes. I've been made. Initiating Vodka Purge.  And no. By targeting voters to sway them to not vote for someone specific. Trump didn't do that.
t1_durhp5w	0.000000	*	I just learned about Unit 731 and the rape of Nanking in 2017 and that's something that you just aren't taught in school, you just have to stumble on it in a random reference like I did.

t1_dui3l96	0.677800	*	It's actually just theft from the public purse. If you're rich enough to do too much damage to the economy for a state to let you fail, you can take what you want regardless of risk.

t1_dushma7	0.624900	*	Does that mean raising taxes on US corporations is a tax on the Americans buying their products? A regressive one at that? Should we just drop all corporate taxes?

t1_duqmf8c	-0.909600	*	right now, he lied to or withheld info from the FBI.  i'm not sure 4 years for lying to a cop is all that minor.  it sort of depends on the other offenses.

t1_duq5hwq	-0.411800	*	How does that relate to the scheme that according to the charges ended before Manafort started working on the campaign?

t1_duhxmnc	0.476700	*	Ah..
t1_dv377yb	-0.155600	*	And that's wrong too, what's your point? Being banned for just questioning X thing is a clear sign of an echo chamber, and even worse if it's just on your first post, you can't deny that.
t1_dumev3w	0.926000	*	> rich people have less of an incentive to accept corruption.  What? Literally the most corrupt people in the world are some of the richest.  Edit: wording

t1_duja2x2	0.458800	*	You're underestimating how quickly a generation of people can change their values from the previous one. It wasn't that long ago that homosexuality was punishable with prison or chemical castration.

t1_durpga3	0.361200	*	Compromise is out the window and has never been an option. The Antigun crowd just takes.
t1_dupbrq8	0.676700	*	No. He will still be a jerk. We just need to go back and take his Grays Sports Almanac off him.
