t1_dv3f0av	0.357000	*	56 hours a week at 19$/hr is 1,064$ a week. He's making less than 19/hr. You have to consider expenses and the fact he's losing out on overtime pay too. U0001f914

t1_dv08exl	0.000000	*	Being socially conservative is not a crime....   I mean I disagree with social conservatives in 90% of the cases, but you make it seem as if being socially conservative makes you less democratic.

t1_duosa6q	-0.476700	*	The few Russians I know are batshit crazy. But none of them are rich.
t1_duaa3pe	0.872700	*	Almost no one would build there any way. Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic are places big players build now.
t1_dumwfh7	0.680800	*	The point is to verify sources and info, not to parrot anything you hear. That's what the elderly/less internet savvy/uneducated fail to do.

t1_duc568j	-0.320800	*	Really? I almost always get downvoted when saying something bad or calling out on America. Remember 57%+ of reddit is from America.  Edit: see downvoted for not even saying anything. Typical reddit.

t1_duci62q	0.238200	*	It allegedly is an ode from growers to our struggle for independence, which was led by William of Orange. 
t1_dun3gwn	-0.880700	*	I still hate that we're calling Russian agents trolls. They're definitely more chaotic evil than chaotic neutral. Normal trolls  like do it for the sake of trolling, not for a political agenda.
t1_dum9yrx	-0.126000	*	Are you surprised? Totally speculating here, but Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and rich people have less of an incentive to accept corruption.

t1_duyk4ux	-0.296000	*	No, that was the 30 years of political hatchetry by the GOP that caused 90% of that disdain. The remaining is what literally every politician every where is. She's nothing special in that regard.
t1_dumyszl	0.000000	*	Thought that was really fucking odd... i live here and it is a bastion for foreign money. 
t1_dv2idbe	0.000000	*	But seriously, what is the agenda here? Let's stop using limited resources for energy? Let's reduce pollution? Even ***IF*** the data is manipulated, how are any of the end goals a bad thing?

t1_durc1h4	-0.296000	*	Americans know little of their own, terrible history.    It's rare to find a country own up to its atrocities.  Germany did a great job after WWII.  But they are the exception.

t1_duthnk8	-0.672400	*	 > but all this fear of the government stems from a US perspective i guess  Right, because some of the worst governments of all time didn't happen less than 100 years ago in europe.
t1_dv44nh9	0.440400	*	I don't know what he uses, but if you install [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) you get a source link under any comment to see what they actually typed without any formatting.
t1_dur23sy	0.493900	*	Thanks for going against the jerk here. This is at the very least an argument that should be met with something more than downvotes and ad hominem.   Too much adoration for billionaires on Reddit. 
t1_dup0zzs	0.000000	*	I'll be honest it was a a typo but when god smiles down on you with gold you sorta roll with it.
t1_duzzq0r	-0.557400	*	Yup its pathetic. Voting for hate. A bit similar to far right people voting for hate against immigrants, latinos etc.

t1_duxzxj3	0.199900	*	Of course. It's just all the exact same talking points and constant use of whataboutism that makes me wonder how many of them are actual people with different opinions and how many are trolls. 
t1_duqtm20	0.381800	*	Why doesn't America lift the stupid embargo then? 
t1_dulruc1	-0.586200	*	Idk, apparently it's any drug addict or drug dealer.  Find the right part of town and you could make some serious money. 
t1_dv0v051	0.000000	*	You laugh but there really is big organic and they push a lot of pseudo science to get people to buy their all natural crap that still has garbage in it except it's overpriced now.

t1_duza8q7	0.133100	*	Would that just be obstruction of justice?
t1_dupj8r9	0.296000	*	I think you mean the 70s. The 80s were probably the most conservative time in modern Iranian history, since that was immediately following the revolution.
t1_dusawen	0.000000	*	United States, #2 exporter in the world.   I think you are dumb 
t1_dupeyv7	0.000000	*	You abandoned that welfare 'argument' immediately.  At least we're on the non-starter of immigration though.  Jesus wept, trolls used to try at least.
t1_dv01tu6	0.000000	*	Then you truly have American values and should run for President regardless of left or right
t1_dulg33e	-0.296000	*	South Carolina, US
t1_dv5qh8g	0.542300	*	We have other parties like libertarian and green party. Problem is the two major parties do everything they can to keep them out of debates and off ballots.

t1_dua47ox	0.526700	*	The polls show a swing of 5-10% re: Brexit.  That's not 'most'.

t1_duenxom	-0.585900	*	No need for the UK to protect them. Russia protects them just fine by not having any bullshit extradition treaties with anyone.
t1_dv3x1be	-0.381800	*	Because that's still time waiting for work? You're not paid for every second you're doing something at work you're expecting to get paid a living wage even if you dont work the full eight hours. 
t1_duwkfs2	0.202300	*	And yet it works for many european countries. Let the free market play itself out here, artificially limiting the number of doctors trained isnt helping anyone but the docs themselves.

t1_dua6bvl	-0.872000	*	And so... someone who is planning on killing a bunch of people would have a moral quandary to buy a gun illegally?  So more gun restrictions is the key....
t1_duzyf8j	-0.928100	*	Mr Malema has a long-standing commitment to land confiscation without compensation. In 2016 he told his supporters he was 'not calling for the slaughter of white people - at least for now'.

t1_dv2m2lk	-0.373600	*	Bushs administration is not Trumps. This is a different beast entirely. I would be very happy to be proven wrong though.
t1_duq6aqp	0.569000	*	Russia's goal was to make USA look unstable. Mission Accomplished.
t1_duphzrb	0.750600	*	Couldn't agree more. America's largest flaw is it's us vs. them attitude when it comes to government. It is the single most contributing factor in our decline as a Nation.

t1_duuzu1k	-0.075000	*	Yeah, the inclusion of the EU here is a little disingenuous. However, the global trend toward totalitarianism seems like it's real and concerning, even if we just look at the other three groups.

t1_duzc8c8	0.296000	*	Just start building shit in cities like every other country does. You have cities with hundreds of thousands and nearly nonexistent public transportation.

t1_dudoklu	0.000000	*	Seriously. Does one world trade center count as one building even though it takes up a whole block? 
t1_dulfkgz	0.137600	*	Hes a dick who is making Israel even more of a laughing stock on the international science.
t1_dujtver	0.000000	*	Explain why this is different from denial of coverage? Because that sure sounds the same as the insurance company computing the potential benefits of treatment against the costs to me. 
t1_durkpwk	0.510600	*	We had an assault weapons ban from about 1992-2008.  How bout we start there?
t1_dv513yt	0.458800	*	There's pretty much universal consensus among economists that protectionism affects the economy and welfare negatively. If you disagree with them you are the one who has some rebuttal to do.
t1_dv4u2s0	-0.716000	*	The b.b.b.but Hillary? thing is becoming such a joke. 
t1_dv03teg	0.318200	*	Daily Mail is not the news. Theres a reason theres the stickied comment above. 
t1_dupg8fb	0.000000	*	No no no, we don't stack vertically anymore. Bad stuff. We stack horizontally. So first, not top.
t1_dv35giy	0.128000	*	This to me is the obvious answer. Don't turn on the lights so that the roaches scurry away and hide. Keep them comfortable and identify who is behind what and how.
t1_dupi3uv	0.000000	*	We just got done with a hard freeze week of -50c, fucking blows. Got my hand stuck on the knob twice.

t1_dujhzav	0.458800	*	President Camacho, here we come. 
t1_ducjg79	0.000000	*	Not everything can be blamed on capitalism. If proper regulations and enforcement were put in place, this wouldn't be an issue. *Pure* capitalism is a problem, just like pure communism/socialism
t1_duw6ap2	0.492600	*	If climate change was a study then 0.000000078947368 would be the sample size of life on earth vs how long we have been tracking weather.   Would you accept that sample size in any other study ?

t1_duxia4c	-0.585900	*	So it's ordered in the holy texts, but that doesn't count this time? 
t1_dua6d8c	0.456500	*	Ok? No. But no one does or was injured, so not the same scale. Cop was negligent and an adult picked up the gun and fired. Not exactly the same.

t1_dusisjm	0.487100	*	Cleaning up America should be the priority before we look at other countries and their issues. Thats what I and most people understand when we hear America First.
t1_dv4ru2y	0.273200	*	In Ireland, people buy Fords.  Although not certain they are manufactured in the USA.  Similar to how most German cars in the US are manufactured in the southern US, like South Carolina.
t1_duv7oy0	0.000000	*	Depends on the product. There are plenty of fresh products, intended to be used within a day or two, packaged in plastic that doesn't decompose ever. Would be a good start to reducing plastic waste.
t1_dv4q4vd	0.000000	*	Sigh.
t1_dud1r30	-0.764600	*	Nobody is trying to justify anything. That's how the argument gets twisted to make it absurd. We are simply pointing out the complete and utter hypocrisy. Are we still allowed to do that?
t1_dv00hra	-0.919400	*	Why does everything go back to trump like god damn no body fuck cares about damn trump. Look in the comments and you will see people saying that it's not racist.
t1_duyjouu	0.657300	*	If you think you can persuade a dumpster fire, then be my guest. Most of us realize what a total waste of time that is. You can't debate someone who lives in an alternate reality 
t1_dv2nxkh	0.401900	*	It's not just the conservatives. It's also Americans' general apathy for voting.
t1_dupn7v9	0.230200	*	Yeah. Germany beat Canada in hockey today. Part of the country is in mourning lol
t1_dui607y	0.226300	*	For the year, I mean. My federal tax liability dropped ~$60 per paycheck without any change in withholdings. 
t1_duw573q	0.000000	*	I think op was referring to big pharma, which does plenty of lobbying. Just a guess tho.   And really? Triple sure? That's a lot of sure.

t1_duzv7fd	0.000000	*	I think the whole country is already salty.
t1_duphvgn	-0.884700	*	I'd be surprised if that were the case. Trump should still be seen as an outlier, not the new norm. Europeans haven't yet given up on the US, I hope.
t1_dum9yrx	0.000000	*	Are you surprised? Totally speculating here, but Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and rich people have less of an incentive to accept corruption.

t1_dv3bdis	0.000000	*	Reddit claims not to allow hate subs but allows alt-right and alt-left subs to continue to call for violence.  The_Donald being one example.

t1_dur496r	0.347900	*	If they done it in the past, what makes you think they aren't doing it now? 
t1_duw66qe	0.163700	*	Why would using bar soap over body wash reduce consumption? Is it because bar soap uses less packaging? Bar soap also tends to come in cardboard boxes instead of plastic bottles.
t1_dupnc83	-0.209100	*	Maybe his genitals should be mutilated. If that's what it takes to protect the public then I'm fine with it.
t1_duetmhf	0.318200	*	He did say cat and not sheep food tbf
t1_duclodb	0.458800	*	>Opposition parties are part of the government.  No, no they are not. The Government consists of the cabinet + monarch, nothing else.
t1_duia4gc	-0.401900	*	>obviously he's not a good candidate to pass a background check  Obviously he was, since he bought multiple guns and ammo legally.  Fact is, that there was nothing legally to stop him.  
t1_dv4dn8d	0.599400	*	The head of state is by definition the head of the state church, and if you are a catholic you are excluded from succession. Furthermore you have bishops with a part in the legislative process by law.
t1_dublnot	-0.226300	*	China can do whatever they want, but if they fire on a US ship in international waters it would most likely spark WW3.  
t1_dv01fhc	0.000000	*	>marginalized minority group  Come on, that is hardly true.  This 'marginalized minority group' is far wealthier on average than the average member of the 'majority group'.
t1_dv2aqv6	0.411800	*	And what year was it that the intergovernmental panel on CLIMATE CHANGE was created? Oh yeah, 1988.
t1_duzyiab	0.510600	*	Can you give a short summary please?  Did he become more radical or more mellow after imprisonment? (If that term even fits)
t1_du9saig	0.000000	*	The sources you will find are all estimations, but the fact is hunger is caused by an inability to properly distribute food, not a lack of calories in the world.

t1_dun7vmr	-0.329100	*	We stopped needing plastic straws around after investing in some high quality metal straws at home. Definitely recommend this. Am an American. :)

t1_duwxag2	-0.335300	*	> He'd deport Brazil back to ~~Portugal~~ Mexico.  FTFY, he doesnt have enough culture to know that Brazil used to be a Portuguese colony.  
t1_duaanh5	0.000000	*	Same thing could be said about Trump, but we already knew how bad he was and how bad itd get before the vote and people voted for him anyways.    The gullible and ignorant know no bounds or borders.
t1_dv4d6es	0.665200	*	Thats incredible. I was told by a technician that most FTTC is only getting 30Mbps. Ive heard fttn is even less. Where do you live?
t1_duyj6b2	0.571900	*	Really its pretty official. Just like I am sure some balked at the idea of the Fireside chats on radio when that tech first became household. Or when everyone had a TV
t1_dug9q4m	0.000000	*	Beta blockers don't eliminate distractions. They calm your peripheral nervous system. Violinists and snipers take them. Great for enhancing performance when fine motor skills are required. 
t1_dufqe85	-0.184900	*	You think Israel somehow surprised Iran by taking out that drone? Israel actually ended up losing a jet in this operation. Why are you supporting this posturing bafoon?
t1_dujxyr8	0.000000	*	Well /r/conspiracy has basically become T_D 2.0 these days, so I would take anything there with a bag of salt.

t1_dv3vq4h	0.000000	*	Great, now I'm wondering if a human could host and birth a chimpanzee embryo...

t1_dungizv	-0.401900	*	Why do you think people are so afraid of having their guns taken away.
t1_dv4sf28	-0.831900	*	Part of the problem is when people talk about politicians in general. It's very clear who's at fault here. 
t1_dusi2fg	0.000000	*	...it doesn't take a lot of intelligence to think critically

t1_dupfd6n	-0.347700	*	And Democrats and moderates who didn't vote for the lesser evil. 
t1_dubbx39	-0.833500	*	As far as straw man arguments go this is actually well done.    So props to you for that at least.

t1_duziwt2	0.822500	*	Democracies too
t1_dulqt81	-0.900300	*	As I said, he's more constrained by institutions, but there's no evidence he is fundamentally different. One is violent authoritarianism in action, the other is the promise of it.

t1_durcytj	0.000000	*	How are social safety nets not socialism?  What point do taxes have to reach before it's socialism?
t1_dv1gfmt	0.025800	*	Well capitalism is modeled after nature so thanks?
t1_dujjaun	-0.102700	*	I refuse to believe that this is a natural reality. Humans cannot be this stupid. This must be a simulation.
t1_dujiuz6	0.027600	*	I care about the mentally ill and their access to firearms.
t1_dudvjem	0.000000	*	Because government knows better the expenses to invent the new drug. Yeah elected clerk knows everything better.  
t1_duirvt2	0.526700	*	Second sentence is true, but because of false presumptions, second sentence is not, as the two sentences are completely unrelated.
t1_duj5mvq	0.000000	*	>70% of population  Ha-ha.
t1_duzb704	-0.153100	*	Plus in 20 years most of those politicians will be dead anyway, so why would they care about future infrastructure needs? 
t1_dupokkt	0.318200	*	The Czech Republic?

t1_duyjcd0	-0.543200	*	Responses like this piss me off so much. They were so desperate for change they elected the most corrupt president of all time? Really? Should we really cater to people so fucking stupid?
t1_ducrhsf	-0.510600	*	more propaganda here than those bots could dream to produce? Not sure what is difficult in the sentence 
t1_duv7dpx	0.440400	*	It's not like they don't use pesticides in organic farming, either. They just use different ones.

t1_dula70b	0.557400	*	No,  Capitol refers to that one hill in DC upon which the building of the Congress was built and not generally the city where the governments are which is called capital. 
t1_dudzn5z	0.000000	*	Well, the FBI will spend over a year to get a couple Russian trolls but won't bother to investigate emails destroyed after being subpoenaed. Someone ought to find those emails. 
t1_dulp5k0	-0.599400	*	I can see Trudeau doing a bunch of shady shit with money and bribes, and being largely ineffective, but I'm pretty certain that neither he or his predecessors had a death squad.
t1_dugl7if	-0.891000	*	She was *designated* as one; there's no evidence, or even mention, of her killing anyone in the article.

t1_duc2quk	-0.051600	*	Telling me even the trees are trying to kill people down there? I mean do you have anything nice and friendly to offer the rest of the world?
t1_dugcmbo	0.365700	*	Where are you from if I may ask?
t1_dv3cdva	-0.172900	*	For sure they let you voice it, you just get downvoted for not going along with the narrative.

t1_duxj61n	0.000000	*	Because they're Russian.  Would a decent American run like a bitch if persecuted by their government?  I'll applaud anybody that stands up to a rifle with nothing more than a middle finger.
t1_duumii6	0.696900	*	They just instated Xi as basically dictator for life. Id say its pretty safe to call China out on stuff without having to defend the US
t1_duruo4n	0.659700	*	Yeah, its weird how so many people rush to defend a dictator. 
t1_duj38x4	0.000000	*	But is that better or worse than having gay sleeper agents that you don't know about?
t1_dujimgn	-0.059000	*	Tell that to the voting citizens of Kentucky..
t1_due3d8j	-0.831600	*	I'd imagine it's a more serious charge so an ally country would be hard pressed to comply. 
t1_duxkusm	0.153100	*	People like this aren't worried about pleasing God. They are worried about keeping up appearances for other people. 
t1_duutp2y	-0.642800	*	I never understood that mentally. Same with the GOP and DNC. Why would you blindly support your choosen party? If I would be part of a party I would be even more critical of everything they do.
t1_dusxnus	0.108800	*	This is BS. After WW2 the US never policed the world. The US, just like Russia, just fucked with it.
t1_dubnphe	-0.112800	*	I could see most of it aside from Russian-Islamic alliance.  That part doesn't seem possible, they'd just as soon stab each other in the back.  Which would probably be the longer term goal.
t1_dv1nz4w	0.903300	*	This is exactly why brexit is fucking dumb. Imagine the UK trying to leverage that on their own.
t1_duhzjdl	0.526700	*	The positive goals in Brexit are an investment that doesn't pay off till at LEAST (and probably not for some time after that) when they actually leave the EU.  We are in a transitory stage.

t1_dv2k62z	0.000000	*	So about tree kidney?
t1_duozxqs	-0.487100	*	I'd jump at US efforts to attack the money laundering and corruption schemes that lets Putin suck wealth out Russia.  Does that bother you?  
t1_dumma2v	0.102700	*	Depends on the college.  If it's a private school, then you're correct.  If you're relying on in-state tuition for a public school then definitely your grades and test scores matter.

t1_dusidk2	0.000000	*	Except it is already being built. 
t1_dujtver	-0.966600	*	Explain why this is different from denial of coverage? Because that sure sounds the same as the insurance company computing the potential benefits of treatment against the costs to me. 
t1_duk89wc	0.128000	*	The headline literally says that this policy was put in effect as a result of Turmp's policy
t1_duvclys	0.868500	*	Pretty sure 3 parties would mean the two smaller parties banding together to fight against the larger party, leaving us with two parties again.
t1_duulp77	0.000000	*	Interesting that you interpreted a statement that applies to both sides of the spectrum in your own narrow way...  The right never fails to disappoint.
t1_dukpm5t	0.762200	*	They definitely do not and we the SKoreans know it.
t1_duptbio	-0.547800	*	Makes sense.  Enormous gains by one entity, relative to others, is usually a symptom of another entity being screwed over.
t1_duqfuh9	0.000000	*	So they can't plead the fifth but what's to stop them from simply not saying anything at all?
t1_dunqugh	0.612400	*	Keeps us tuned in, yes, but how is that taking away anyone's human rights?
t1_duupegu	-0.493900	*	Theres not a cap on the amount of possible cunts. Why cant they both be?

t1_dv2mfyt	0.949300	*	> the better the chances of getting a rational human being in the White House  FTFY.  Can we get over the Us vs. Them mentality already?  Because it's part of the problem in the U.S.
t1_ducvext	-0.724300	*	Are you saying its OK that Putin did it because Obama did?
t1_duum04q	0.785800	*	Not really, its just a really bad system from a mathematical point of view. In the metric system, everything adds up.
t1_dund6ps	0.000000	*	I don't see why not but I think why nothing has been tried is because how fragile the flora and fauna is in Oz. I have heard their import laws concerning plants and animals are very strick.

t1_ducrupx	-0.526700	*	I mean, twitter WAS a mistake. I am not saying reddit is the golden bastion of social media, but dumb people use twitter, so dumb opinions spread. 
t1_dv37hhj	-0.492700	*	So a hostile power secretly providing support for a political candidate by pretending to be American citizens doesn't scare you?

t1_duy2nm6	0.702800	*	Succession by hereditary lineage and succession via institutional appointment is just a matter of window dressing?   That's the second dumbest thing I've read in months.  
t1_duymmw3	0.128000	*	Especially in light of this one: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282  And that other one he made about the same topic that I can't seem to find now.
t1_duwo95t	0.077200	*	Most nurses do not have a bachelor degree, they went to college then they started working. 90k salaries are a minority for sure.
t1_duphzrb	0.680800	*	Couldn't agree more. America's largest flaw is it's us vs. them attitude when it comes to government. It is the single most contributing factor in our decline as a Nation.

t1_duxoesq	-0.098900	*	Russian police: stern... stern but fair.

t1_duje5bk	0.000000	*	Nobody brought up either of those things other than you two. It seems it's true, at a certain point you cross that line and become what you hate. 
t1_dux9plf	0.000000	*	Reddit is the second most popular social media site in the United States, and I believe the fourth most visited site overall.  Reddit is extremely popular.

t1_duwtb6k	-0.680800	*	only if you ignore everything good about the US, plus it's not like they're losing anything; if they stop getting paid the government can be sued, so this is basically meaningless rhetoric.

t1_duok15i	0.177900	*	I was just wondering why these changes are actually being made. Could you explain the economics here for someone not in the loop?
t1_dv00fdi	-0.822500	*	That's stupid to make up a word like reverse racism when racism already fits. 
t1_duxbz1w	-0.019100	*	This is one thing America does better than other nations. The right to bear arms is an inalienable right under the constitution. It doesn't matter how many people are against it, it's your *right*.

t1_duqjy98	-0.625800	*	...on Putin's orders for maximum chaos.
t1_duqkojy	0.607600	*	It's madness that the penalties are so minor. Some weed dealers have spent more time in jail than these people who are betraying our country. What exactly are American Values these days?
t1_dumnfp5	-0.240600	*	Not all Turkish tribes were of Asian ethnicity, thats a more recent development. A lot of the tribes were Caucasian.

t1_dunwx94	-0.807400	*	Considering Trump has in the past called for the jailing of his political enemies (lock her up!) and loves attacking the press, those are probably not your best examples of how he is not like Putin.

t1_due0pyj	0.000000	*	Humans would already be on Mars....
t1_dutt27e	-0.128000	*	Sentences have distinct thoughts. One thought is it that the refugees are bringing over diseases to spike up these numbers. Second thought is they are the macro level problem in Europe.

t1_duzdh4h	0.871400	*	That's a complete lack of understanding of basic economics. China is overdue for a routine economic crash.

t1_duqncd5	-0.556200	*	I just learned grammar.
t1_duk30sa	-0.309600	*	That's actually an interesting idea. They could design a bioreactor to sequester CO2. I'm guessing a tumorous tree wouldn't be the best form factor though.

t1_dusazb6	0.000000	*	I'm enlisting really soon, fighting a war for no reason doesn't really interest me. If we aren't defending the US or saving lives I'm not very eager to do my job.

t1_duou06c	-0.889500	*	Nah, that's just you being triggered and making connections that aren't there. The joke is about how Argentina took in a bunch of Nazis, it has nothing to do with them being Russian.
t1_dux75er	0.000000	*	> I won't say it was the DNC though because we don't have any hard evidence.  You're right. It probably was the Russians.

t1_dujkd0f	-0.510600	*	It has always been normal. Sure, before Trump it was easier to delude yourself about your social status and your political influence. But that's the only difference.
t1_duwnnfv	-0.701400	*	It's almost like if you don't allow for a free market to exist, and you embrace socialism, people suffer unduly due to the tyranny of socialist thinking.
t1_duz00qe	-0.709600	*	No form on government makes correct decisions. At least with democracy the people are responsible since it's what they voted.

t1_dugcorq	0.000000	*	Dont think the background check looks into someones social media.  Story I read the FBI was contacted twice about him making threats.  Nothing was done.  It appears the FBI dropped the ball.

t1_dui4fum	-0.287100	*	Not really. It's like the Catalonia vote. The majority didn't neither because it was an illegal vote. Boycotting elections is a thing. 
t1_dv1p9lm	-0.492000	*	Exactly. Every time I hear people talking about these no go zones in Europe I think to myself most of our decent sized cities in America have areas you don't want to go in.

t1_dusouvk	0.898500	*	Meh, the Republican congress is allowing this to happen through slipshod governing.   This is in bad faith with the people who elected them.

t1_dumuw1w	0.000000	*	I wouldn't call that a straw man. I'd say that claiming facebook ads and internet trolls cost Hillary the election is grasping at straws rather than accepting defeat. 
t1_duyjcd0	-0.051600	*	Responses like this piss me off so much. They were so desperate for change they elected the most corrupt president of all time? Really? Should we really cater to people so fucking stupid?
t1_dunjl1y	0.202300	*	There's also a lot of anti-NATO sentiment from the NATO bombings during the Yugoslavian war. Understandably, it'd be hard to trust them.

t1_duo56zm	-0.750600	*	It's proof that the society was never that civilized in the first place. So why don't you work to fix the problem instead of just beating the victims down?
t1_duydqdb	0.000000	*	You're kidding, right? Do you not read the news or browse reddit? Watch NPR?  Your claim about Republicans is proof of the very thing you're denying.

t1_dui4fum	-0.750600	*	Not really. It's like the Catalonia vote. The majority didn't neither because it was an illegal vote. Boycotting elections is a thing. 
t1_duq3ok0	0.778300	*	> Are the women paid?  I'm betting they get regularly *fed*, which is probably pretty good for North Korea. 
t1_duagm8o	0.340000	*	Which just backs up my case - Japanese are not talking about this, because this is OBVIOUS.

t1_durbrp4	0.361200	*	Two sides too every coin. There are dozens of examples where Conservatives could say the identical thing about Liberals. Let's not jump to being rash.
t1_dupjp16	0.000000	*	Don't put things like not trying to be insensitive when looking for a serious response. People most likely assume you're actually apathetic, or sarcastically degrading the act as pointless.

t1_duxfqgy	-0.304500	*	No, it's people carrying on in this thread like their countries have never done anything wrong.  Sometimes we need to look at our own histories before baying for blood.

t1_duouiuq	0.025800	*	He was involved for longer than that and collusion isn't the only reason to question someone's integrity.

t1_duhlcon	0.421500	*	It all sounds too familiar. Just like how people figured out how to make money on bad mortages because they didn't give a rat's ass about helping people buy and keep their homes.
t1_dupp57v	-0.440400	*	Nutella only uses palm oil from environmental friendly sources now though.
t1_dv3922j	0.746900	*	What does the Seth Rich conspiracy nonsense have to do with Trump?  Nothing. It exists solely to create division and it is something you gleefully take part in.

t1_dun8iup	0.000000	*	How do they taste? I've always thought ceramic or glass would be a much better straw material. 
t1_duohamw	-0.886000	*	Didn't realize that was a crime. 
t1_dv4w4ob	0.421500	*	Exactly. I do believe that no political administration is without its scandal, but this seems so much more prevalent than ever before. Maybe its the coverage? 
t1_dunh7ov	0.292400	*	Russia would just cut gas off again for eastern Europe if the EU decided to grow a backbone. 
t1_dufo2ub	-0.640200	*	That all makes sense as far as it goes, but how do planes not have some kind of 'You are pointing this thing at a freakin mountain!' alarm?
t1_dv1q5of	0.381800	*	But it was Alabama. Making Roy Moore a viable candidate in California or somewhere that like would be impressive. Alabama though?  Pfft. 
t1_duhilrz	-0.226300	*	Am I alone in thinking this isn't an acceptable gift? I feel like giving to charity on behalf of somebody is pointless.

t1_duhxsmu	-0.077200	*	but we don't know if thats the case just because UK exited the EU. For all we know the UK might have better trading agreements with its former colonies like Canada, US and Australia.

t1_dujn1hv	0.000000	*	Stating that you don't believe a proposition means that you don't deem it to be true. He denied that it was true that the Russians interfered. Do you get it now? At all?

t1_dush74u	-0.179600	*	Then what body of people do classic conservatives turn to? It's not like we can just change our values because the people who pretend to represent those values are incompetent.
t1_dui7q1n	0.680000	*	Well who determines the value of that wealth? Are you going to tally up every painting every person owns?

t1_dumtddf	-0.296000	*	no, no they did not. 
t1_dui747d	-0.688600	*	The biggest reason for violence is that so many different people hate each other. It's not technology and it's not law. It's culture.

t1_dv5slfp	0.387500	*	Exactly 
t1_dumaj93	-0.794200	*	It is far more basic than capitalism.  It is the trait of greed that we have evolved.  No matter what system you have the most greedy will collect the most at the expense of the less greedy.

t1_dunoqfw	0.000000	*	The Supreme Court disagrees, not only because a locked-up gun is useless for defense, but because it's unenforceable without infringing on the fourth amendment.

t1_dujmch7	0.564700	*	I feel like I could suggest an unbiased news source but they're all pretty much accused of being biased now by people who don't like the facts they're reporting.  Safest bet, stick to local news. 
t1_dv0nvv8	0.000000	*	Those studies focused on whether gmos were healthy to be consumed by humans right? I think there is still concern about the effects on flora and fauna if I am up to date on the matter. 
t1_dv229ok	-0.296000	*	What cities.  
t1_duaddg4	0.077200	*	I am sure his incarceration will be both all to brief and horrifically long.    I'm guessing China is a little less lenient with their traitors than we are in the west.

t1_dux13hy	0.398700	*	> But if you can even stand by your own basic principles, damn...smh.  That's only your opinion. Trump doesn't think intervening in Chinese politics is the basic principles of U.S.
t1_dupfbks	0.815600	*	There is also a lot to say about the infrastructural development Eastern Europe received under the Communist Bloc. I would say that was a larger factor than anything Germany has done. 
t1_dv1joh1	-0.648600	*	I assume the /s is there because there is no way a Republican administration will ever rebuild Puerto Rico. 
t1_duvi0tu	0.571900	*	This is the truth, all stories to the contrary and any claim otherwise is simply western propaganda.

t1_dulipu0	-0.640800	*	What would be worse for the environment? ~750 gallons of fuel (max) in a 188 billion gallon capacity lake, or a potential airplane crash into the lake, people, or a nearby town?
t1_duif8fj	0.000000	*	> very good public transport    That's an understatement. They have possibly the best public transport in the world.
t1_dun52j3	-0.273200	*	There's a military satire blog, called duffelblog, that's very popular with US service members.  Primarily because their satire stories are San near nail on head correct.

t1_dua4r3a	0.493900	*	Oh indeed, but no nation is free in that sense. Everyone gets pushed around a bit, though obviously some more than others.

t1_dui57ya	0.948000	*	I think once you get to having billions, the higher taxes wouldn't change your lifestyle at all.  Very different than raising higher taxes on someone making 200K in San Francisco.   
t1_dube5gg	-0.897900	*	That's pretty irrelevant to the modern situation.
t1_duvbf1h	-0.734000	*	Not necessarily. I spent two months in rural parts of Bali and many people simply don't understand the consequences of what they're doing. 
t1_duyum8s	0.000000	*	It's easier to think they're trolls than to believe that voting Americans can be so ignorant.

t1_duqhlhb	0.000000	*	If you're asking if the constitution guarantees the people to own firearms similar to the US, than the answer is NO.   Do Russians have a legal pathway to obtain a firearms? The answer is YES. 
t1_duwfocm	-0.421500	*	Regardless of who funds it, it's still an outside source, so striking that through seems disingenuous.

t1_dud3ifl	-0.409700	*	It's because palm oil is a solid at room temperature, so peanut butter with palm oil won't separate.

t1_duk6ai4	0.944100	*	It's our forestry industry. By law for every tree they cut they have to pay to have another one replaced.  The fund is massive. They are always hiring tree planters to work for pennies.

t1_duqvfup	0.000000	*	I bet Chelsea Clinton went to Stanford and then worked at media companies for 600-900k/year based on merit?  Or that Obama's kid is going to Harvard off merit? 
t1_durjy8s	-0.949300	*	Because the US is more less involved with arming militants as well.. acting like you're the authority along with having your hands dirty doesn't speak a lot about credibility.

t1_dugyork	0.000000	*	And? Nothing you said contradicts me. 
t1_duqkojy	-0.038700	*	It's madness that the penalties are so minor. Some weed dealers have spent more time in jail than these people who are betraying our country. What exactly are American Values these days?

t1_duxdezn	0.696900	*	I didn't say that. I think it's a stupid law. However, he's suggesting that just making such a law would mean that Poland was responsible... which borders on Holocaust denial.
t1_dudstvk	0.440400	*	Very few Americans shop for their own healthcare. Their employers shop for them, and that's another huge problem...

t1_dv3mwqv	0.000000	*	The Founding Fathers explicitly wanted our government to be different, to function for the common good rather than as a profit engine.  It was nice while it lasted.

t1_duq5tvh	-0.879800	*	Did they actually promote Clinton in any way?  Most of the efforts were pro Trump or pro Bernie, but actively anti-Hilary.
t1_duq3rcl	-0.292400	*	Sort of, these PMC's in this group are used by Russia to give a very thin veneer of plausible deniability, and are used in offensive ops. See Ukraine, same guys.
t1_dv031n7	-0.102700	*	Also outreach, facilities, great staff, that sorta stuff  Could happen if we had more tax revenue, but I'm ok with paying it it means I get to see cool shit
t1_dux6gry	0.000000	*	Well said, America had no rocket research until the stole Nazis scientists. Germany made it to the moon, not Amerika.

t1_dv2in2l	-0.051600	*	No :( I've been looking for one recently because of brexit. As a Scottish citizen, brexit will destroy us. The worst thing is, we didn't even want it, it was imposed on us

t1_dv4r1gh	0.510600	*	Taking a plea doesn't mean you did it, even though in this case he very likely did it
t1_dv4dl5o	-0.573400	*	The sad difference between the left and the right is, both sides have their crazy racists, but only one side has pushed them to the presidency.

t1_dunt12j	-0.202300	*	Yes, but if the guy is selling guns on a regular bases for profit then he would technically be a dealer even if he says he isn't, and federal laws would come into play. 
t1_duok15i	0.000000	*	I was just wondering why these changes are actually being made. Could you explain the economics here for someone not in the loop?
t1_dusq14m	-0.845900	*	I am not saying the CCP won't fall from power as all other governments have, just that the notion that they are anywhere near a downfall state is pure fiction. 
t1_dungz11	0.000000	*	Because it's not the focus
t1_dv1kxps	0.599400	*	Actually hes keeping campaign promises thats what we like about him.
t1_duyzusc	0.000000	*	Belarus is basically Russia
t1_dukxfbw	-0.956500	*	The BLM complain is that black lives are treated as if they mattered less, which is why the focus is on black and not all lives.

t1_dv45dmj	0.421500	*	You actually think your tiny country would survive on its own without being part of an alliance like the EU? Times have changed since the 17th century, you know.
t1_dv02evt	0.000000	*	Also because CNN is incredibly left wing as is MSN and other news organizations. Some people will see this as revenge for what happened hundreds of years ago.
t1_duzweot	0.000000	*	They were attacked for their economic possessions because they were white
t1_dubnphe	0.000000	*	I could see most of it aside from Russian-Islamic alliance.  That part doesn't seem possible, they'd just as soon stab each other in the back.  Which would probably be the longer term goal.

t1_dv0xaui	0.226300	*	But nicotine has to do with addictiveness. What does that have to do with lethality to bees? Though I suppose nicotine has been an insecticide for a long, long time.
t1_dukq0as	0.361200	*	Jesus is that a real thing? So for them the first port of call online is a social media platform...that's a terrifying omen right there

t1_dv2o5yv	0.028900	*	Just wait until Canada rolls down to annex the U.S. after Trump collapses the economy.  Then we'll *all* be sorry!

t1_dupgbwx	-0.361200	*	It went well for 28 years.
t1_duphzrb	0.361200	*	Couldn't agree more. America's largest flaw is it's us vs. them attitude when it comes to government. It is the single most contributing factor in our decline as a Nation.

t1_duyk4ux	-0.967800	*	No, that was the 30 years of political hatchetry by the GOP that caused 90% of that disdain. The remaining is what literally every politician every where is. She's nothing special in that regard.

t1_dv4sz7m	-0.401900	*	Old saying: If you owe the bank 50,000 dollars that's your problem. If you owe the bank 10 million dollars that's their problem.

t1_dut19aj	0.000000	*	Hey I have a question about Mongolia, while your here. Whenever I look at maps, Mongolia is labeled distinctly, but also within China. What's the deal there? Is it like a special province or what?

t1_dunsc0a	0.000000	*	Large drinks depending on what state you are in. some are plastic some are foam, but thats pretty much it.

t1_duo9r0l	-0.659700	*	Yeah, kind of like domestic policing vs a literal overcrowded war zone.  Youd expect the latter to be abundant with casualties, but here we are.
t1_duqp7t9	0.000000	*	It does if you don't spend 100 grand on a worthless arts degree and learn something useful to society like math or physics or engineering

t1_dv2mbk1	0.624900	*	You are misinformed - the US has lost a bunch of cases at the WTO and has been sanctioned as a result.
t1_duucgco	-0.585900	*	In the U.S.A., a very large majority of children are addicted to social media. It is almost impossible for a parent to prevent it.

t1_dv4muyl	-0.624900	*	Yeah the joke in new Brunswick is the Irving's have never lost an election. They own the oil refinery the trains in Lac Megantic were heading too. 
t1_dv33h5h	0.361200	*	I get that it's a pretty blatant difference, but it's hardly the most important thing the films left out. I think some of the larger characterisation stuff was more important than one line. 
t1_dv2ga74	0.986000	*	Oh, he is pretty much a symptom. But it's up to the US to fix their internal problems, nothing the world, let alone Europe, can do about that. 
t1_duli2yz	0.000000	*	Part of the reason the EU was created was to make it economically stupid to start wars between members - Evidence?

t1_duqkojy	0.000000	*	It's madness that the penalties are so minor. Some weed dealers have spent more time in jail than these people who are betraying our country. What exactly are American Values these days?
t1_duajc2r	-0.585000	*	\>99% of the comments have their score still hidden, and probably even more so when that comment was made. Top comment currently has >3000 upvotes.
t1_dv2r4si	0.000000	*	I wonder why they haven't...must be the gray hair. I certainly can't think of any other immediately apparent reason that community wouldn't be 100% behind him.

t1_duji7qx	-0.434400	*	I remember my history teacher in highschool saying that the U.S. only has until 2045 before it collapses. It sounded crazy then back in 2010 but it seems so plausible now...

t1_dudy3t4	0.273200	*	That doesn't reflect my experience (Englishman living in France with French wife). On the other hand, ask my wife's uncle what he thinks of the Germans....

t1_duk30sa	-0.794600	*	That's actually an interesting idea. They could design a bioreactor to sequester CO2. I'm guessing a tumorous tree wouldn't be the best form factor though.
t1_duqn6js	0.000000	*	How do you get to this level of influence being this dumb though? Like the sheer ignorance is baffling. I don't get it.

t1_dudj72j	-0.616400	*	Any biofuel that uses food stuffs isn't a good biofuel. There are plenty of methods that use food waste which is far better for a variety of reasons we just have to invest in them. 
t1_dv31dbw	-0.831600	*	That's ironic because if you'd made a few more comments you would have been autobanned by a handful of left wing subs.
t1_dud3ehc	0.401900	*	Unless Trump is in handcuffs they'll say he and his compatriots are totally innocent, and when he is, they'll say it's a coup.
t1_dv2sm0p	0.440400	*	Lol, republicans reading into details of a rich white guy
t1_dui8xdp	0.000000	*	Maybe an emergency tax on wealth is the way to go. Unrealized capital gains have been off limits for US taxation, but a wealth based tax for all with more than maybe $2m could be a great start. 
t1_dukiiin	0.526700	*	Our of curiosity is there any evidence released at this point that make it clear that he deserves to do time?
t1_dum042w	0.421500	*	What!? And that didn't work either! WHAT IN THE FUCK?!?!?1
t1_dug8caj	0.840200	*	I'm not sure how your comment is related to mine. 
t1_ducsqnc	-0.735100	*	One thing that helped me was only drinking half the can to get rid of the headache and pouring the rest out. Eventually, I went from 3 green monsters a day to none.
t1_duts9zb	-0.153100	*	Jesus why are you getting downvoted so heavily its a solid point your making...

t1_duzzf2v	0.836000	*	You've never set foot in south africa.
t1_duk30sa	-0.557400	*	That's actually an interesting idea. They could design a bioreactor to sequester CO2. I'm guessing a tumorous tree wouldn't be the best form factor though.
t1_dutk2ds	0.296000	*	> same effect with vaccines  I'm gonna need a source to support this argument. I've never seen any evidence that vaccines adversely affect gut bacteria/archaea. Especially viral vaccines.

t1_duz7hnj	0.177900	*	Wasn't it Trump selling Fuck Your Feelings shirts at his rallies?
t1_duxi1p8	-0.318200	*	Iran is not a religious society.  The Iranian government does not officially recognise the existence of non-religious Iranians. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Iran). Right.
t1_duahdz1	0.000000	*	I wouldn't be surprised if Navalny shot himself in the head 4-5 times in the coming weeks, or forgot to de-radiate his tea. 
t1_dugbx5m	0.000000	*	If you only look at the 3 or so swing states, but for that to exist a million or so would have to also be brainwashed in the other 47 states.

t1_duuczgx	0.000000	*	Control + Alt + Defleet
t1_duormi3	0.372400	*	The Nazis killed people based of off who they were, not the beliefs that they held.
t1_dv0olrx	0.632600	*	Yes, and there is some level of shady lobbying going on in Brussels, but still a couple of orders of magnitude better system than the science-less pay-for-policy US congress 
t1_duylbuh	0.000000	*	> might actually be illegal for the president to do that  Do you honestly think he or his advisers have considered that and that that's why they havn't deleted this stuff?
t1_dv0j0lx	0.440400	*	This is such fear mongering nonsense.  Nothing will happen.

t1_dv3d1gn	0.865800	*	Of course you did, Burger King pays bi weekly. 
t1_dummzjx	-0.935800	*	>Hate and fear will never solve the NK problem  You'd be surprised with what someone can pull off with a false flag and strategic weapons.
t1_dubkp7e	0.000000	*	Wasn't it called Asian squatting too?
t1_dujjjlq	0.570200	*	Troll farms trying to convince us it's too late, to give up. It's not too late.
t1_dupgjy5	-0.557400	*	Does that strat include getting fucked up twice in a row?
t1_duenwwo	0.902200	*	How do you execute him 4 times? Strap him on an electric chair, lethal injection on both arms with a bullet in the head?
t1_dv13pr9	-0.557900	*	Is this why it specifically lowers the amount of queen bees?
t1_duet4wx	-0.771700	*	Yeah, I discovered that with the post I submitted yesterday. Yikes. I could practically smell the vodka in that thread.

t1_dv5l0ie	0.000000	*	Now you're just being pedantic. The money for transfer payments comes from federal taxes. Have provinces are footing the bill regardless of how direct the transfer is. 
t1_duuu293	-0.791800	*	But Korean is East Asia? 
t1_duvwz3p	0.000000	*	You're welcome to eat all the GMO you want.  Why not tell your congressperson to vote for clear GMO labeling so you can easily find and consume all of it you want?

t1_duyjcd0	-0.950000	*	Responses like this piss me off so much. They were so desperate for change they elected the most corrupt president of all time? Really? Should we really cater to people so fucking stupid?
t1_duuo716	0.493900	*	Seems like taking the boat and repurposing it would be a better idea. Hell even if you scraped it. Don't sink it and pollute the water.
t1_dugvyo4	-0.510600	*	Whines about personal attacks then goes straight for insults Wow
t1_duw2iks	0.000000	*	By what standard?
t1_duskcu6	-0.557400	*	Gobee.bike is a Hong Kong company, where the concept of shareable bikes is sound. Unfortunately it's not the case in France

t1_dusvbnu	0.652600	*	Youd be an idiot if you didnt admit that they call themselves Muslim.  Religious extremism doesnt really need to have anything to do with the texts in question, its often just an identity thing
t1_dv2q2kn	0.877300	*	Oh damn, right on. I would imagine they, too, have a legal definition rather than actually *mean* life sentence but I have no idea.

t1_dupo1zv	0.680800	*	They are competing under the Olympic flag, not the flag of any country. It's not only for dual nationals. All Russian Olympic athletes that weren't already caught doping were allowed.

t1_dv29ywb	0.000000	*	I would seriously bow down if he s been a diaguised democrat all along. Doubt it though. Same end result anyway

t1_duqy2rq	-0.153100	*	Yeah there's no proof of that I think but it seems like that's what he would do.
t1_dul1cg1	0.000000	*	I agree. A simple do you have AIDS? Yes or no? clarifies it and you're good to go....
t1_duhjf9o	0.000000	*	Then you run into issues with gender quota. Several sectors have these quota imposed on them (only for senior positions ofc, no-one gives a fuck if a sewer cleaning company is 100% staffed by men).
t1_duz7hnj	-0.296000	*	Wasn't it Trump selling Fuck Your Feelings shirts at his rallies?
t1_dumgc3y	0.340000	*	Like how Putin annexed Crimea? I'm not seeing a difference

t1_dv3ebtj	0.000000	*	It can be argued that the cold war never ended 
t1_duoy7kk	-0.651200	*	Lol can you imagine being on the other end of that? Yeah a few officers will be dropping it off, just talk to them and you'll be fine. No way. 
t1_dv3639g	0.932500	*	Did you read Mueller's indictment.  It says clearly that they wanted Trump or Bernie.

t1_dui1v9q	0.000000	*	Deserves got nothing to do with it.  Hating him might make you feel better but it won't change anything.

t1_duyn8ag	0.551400	*	Never said he is a Dem plant. Just because he was appointed by Republicans doesn't mean he isn't being motivated by trying to remove our President from power.
t1_duseh33	0.340000	*	Worse for who?
t1_dupxnfk	0.571900	*	That is completely not true.  Only someone who knows nothing about social science research would say Survey = useless.  It depends on the methodology whether or not it is scientific.  
t1_duxhofs	0.000000	*	If you fuck up the meaning and interpretation of stuff enough a lot of things can be used for evil. That doesnt mean the thing itself is actually evil.
t1_duqcqal	0.000000	*	Aww. How cute.
t1_dujbheu	-0.273200	*	But thats not what it does. Its your problem if the first thing you think of when reading the word Homosexuality is sex.
t1_dv1ziks	-0.226300	*	CMC is definitely doing well. If the buyout of Gerdau's assets they have entered into talks about are approved by the regulators, they will be in even better shape.

t1_dv2108l	-0.246600	*	Lol militarily and economically Russia is a joke. 
t1_duni796	0.370800	*	Most places already allow concealed carry. People at schools, hospitals, and churches are sitting ducks, as it is public knowledge that nobody is allowed to carry in these locations.
t1_dv20dbv	-0.964200	*	 How would you feel about a decapitated picture of one of your relatives being used to win a petty argument?
t1_duxjzie	0.527300	*	How much sun is there even in Ontario? Like, 3? That's low man.
t1_dv4ae7x	-0.859100	*	Sad but true, and the rest of us have to share the country with these people.  The best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter --- Winston Churchill
t1_dund39t	0.000000	*	I live in a developing country. The fear of germs is more of a developed country thing. Only rich people here suffer from it. 
t1_duy164w	0.000000	*	> I'm not sure what part of that doesn't make sense to you.  How many different groups of police between two airports do you think?
t1_dv1i7lw	0.247900	*	sounds very similar to their dipshit argument about how they never produced agent orange because there was a change of management at some point.
t1_dugc6hs	0.000000	*	#***CITIZENS OF DALARAN***

t1_due8fdl	-0.476700	*	He can pardon anyone charged with a federal crime.  I have no doubt whatsoever he would try to pardon himself if charged.
t1_dusjmfp	-0.585900	*	Sorry you cant read Gawker anymore :(
t1_duit0jt	0.296000	*	Only if you do a bad job. It's very easy to dilute it to where it has no impact at all.
t1_dugca0o	-0.959700	*	TIL....thanks. really insightful 
t1_dudtfh9	-0.226300	*	Free market doesn't mean no intellectual property. Most fields have intellectual property. Few are broken the way pharma is.

t1_dugna0i	0.025800	*	> I'm afraid you've got to start facing up to 46% who supported him instead of hiding behind this popular vote mitigation.   30%. The US suffers from a concerning lack of voter participation.

t1_dunsa2d	0.420100	*	You're free to disagree but I think the freedom to criticize political leaders, or at the very least the freedom to not clap for them, is absolutely a human right
t1_dusidcg	0.000000	*	Reagan was dumb as shit but controlled by smarter people than Trump.
t1_dunms58	0.000000	*	1400 years  Edit : not 1400 hundred
t1_dudidsu	-0.226300	*	He definitely does have patronym, however the grand jury failed to identify it. This means it can be any Vladimir Venkov now.
t1_dukpg37	0.000000	*	*laughs*
t1_dup9ze8	-0.267200	*	Wait till you get your wish and America disengages from enforcing our present world order. I bet things are going to be way better with Chinese leadership. Or maybe with anarchy. 
t1_duuf30g	0.401900	*	Did he? I thought Russia never had  limits like that. Do you have a source? 
t1_dur7fg4	-0.958400	*	Should they though?  Some would argue it's that guilt that lead Germany to mess up the refugee crisis so badly.
t1_duz4lre	0.735100	*	oh god can you imagine joining the navy only to work at a starbucks on your deployment?
t1_dufib5r	0.273200	*	And moats!  No...wait....

t1_due3d8j	0.457200	*	I'd imagine it's a more serious charge so an ally country would be hard pressed to comply. 
t1_duje4gg	0.273200	*	> things of the sort  Like what?

t1_dv2vv4z	0.659700	*	I'm not saying Chinese steel does not exist in the U.S. I am saying it is a very small amount of steel on the U.S. market.  Start here: https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-china.pdf

t1_duf63s3	0.000000	*	That was a decent answer. A group of people should always have an outsider police them preferably with no affiliation/connections and can't be bribed beforehand

t1_dup0y32	-0.051600	*	The words ...those alike... in your original comment seem to imply that fascists are all old timers that will soon die off. Maybe I misread it. 
t1_dupel2j	0.817600	*	?? If it wouldn't make any difference then it doesn't make them careless or not tech savvy to not do it.

t1_dubffs7	0.000000	*	Nonsense, only politicians are sneaky! Also you know what's nice? Enjoying the bot fights with a nice cold Fanta^^TM
t1_dupy1wb	-0.742900	*	Yes, the pope and his buddies are probably proud of him. Sick bastards.
t1_dv047ik	0.757900	*	*Democracy is the world's worst form of government, except for every other form that had been tried in history*  -Me, paraphrasing Winston Churchill
t1_duzsuyy	-0.275500	*	I cannot even imagine the terror of being there. Hope they get the hell gone before it's to late.
t1_dv1odkf	0.585900	*	The contractors that will be forced to buy steel at inflated prices to complete jobs that they have already signed contracts for? This will hurt them too.
t1_duzw15z	-0.115400	*	You'd ironically probably be SAFER in NK or Iran... they aren't borderline genocidal towards white people
t1_dv2g0d9	0.102700	*	What leads you to that conclusion? 
t1_ducw12r	0.202300	*	No it doesn't. People up vote blatant insults all the time.

t1_duuyaeo	-0.519400	*	Only a wannabe thank God. To use the brazen tact of Brits, What a cunt.
t1_duxbz1w	-0.071700	*	This is one thing America does better than other nations. The right to bear arms is an inalienable right under the constitution. It doesn't matter how many people are against it, it's your *right*.

t1_dv0atep	0.153100	*	Actually since we didn't have an R rating on games, they required remastering to remove the R rated elements. Think it was 2 years ago we got an R rating finally.
t1_due4ap4	0.000000	*	It's literally Aleve that you can buy over the counter and and Nexium  which you can also buy over the counter combined in a pill.  It's not a drug that can be abused at all.
t1_duq1afv	-0.599400	*	Not sure about last year but in 2013 the US spent 32 billion on foreign aid which is about 0,19% of its GNI while germany spent 0,41% of its GNI.
t1_dupgama	0.837700	*	Where are you from if I may ask? Since you don't seem to think a strong military is of any importance?
t1_duyg9ya	0.000000	*	They let you do it isnt him saying that they like it, anymore than if he had said They dont fight back
t1_duib348	-0.560000	*	This is exactly the kind of thing he talks about though. Why does he pay less taxes than his secretary? Because the tax code is written to benefit the rich.
t1_dv31dbw	0.000000	*	That's ironic because if you'd made a few more comments you would have been autobanned by a handful of left wing subs.
t1_dud3ehc	0.000000	*	Unless Trump is in handcuffs they'll say he and his compatriots are totally innocent, and when he is, they'll say it's a coup.
t1_duhugif	-0.359700	*	And we should listen to Vox.com for their scientific and unbiased reporting?
t1_duo6buy	0.177900	*	really as it went there 4 times no and each time they kept the ban?

t1_dua10r9	-0.699600	*	I do business in Japan. After the Brexit vote, we had our Japanese agent ask his contacts what they made of the vote.   They don't care, he said, after speaking to them. 
t1_dushu43	-0.526700	*	I was going to make a joke about /r/politics, but [holy shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/alt_source_bot_log/comments/802fs5/banned_rpolitics_nunes_gets_conservative_award/)... Haha.
t1_dulhubf	0.000000	*	Man, I want that kind of funeral tbh. Fuck sad and getting thrown in a hole. I want my own fucking music festival.

t1_dujsvha	-0.250000	*	Yup, when you present them with concrete evidence they either bail or go for the whataboutism.
t1_dv95mok	-0.571900	*	A concerted effort to steal peoples votes through systematic manipulation is worse.  As a patriot I am sorry you feel your vote or the votes of your fellow citizens have so little value.
t1_dv1kly3	0.273200	*	Camelbak is just a brand, there is already tons of similar products. Not sure about Bushnell.
t1_duw0o9c	0.421500	*	Nah I made that comment to rope you out. Sorry bud 
t1_dui7u0u	-0.258400	*	The need for money to get elected is a huge part of the problem and easily fixable. Thing is the people that can fix it are in power and stand to lose that power by fixing it.   TLDR: Fuck us. 
t1_duwrxof	0.128000	*	That's still a good thing, another full bus means another 30 vehicles not on the road. Underused mass transit causes more polition than overused.
t1_duudtuo	0.000000	*	Ocean Law? What about Bird Law? 
t1_duuc76j	-0.316700	*	Only if you're european. An Australian would die at anything below 20

t1_dujjlmp	0.000000	*	And then... this? https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640
t1_durmris	-0.872000	*	True, but they just wanted a job.  They trusted Putin, because in their sphere that makes sense to them.  I didn't say they were smart.
t1_duaj8ge	0.177900	*	I don't understand your comment. Do you think that adults should simply ignore it when their elected representatives announce that they're planning to commit war crimes?
t1_dv327ny	-0.025800	*	/conspiracy is just sad. They have an honest to goodness conspiracy in their midsts and they ignore it.

t1_duiqov0	0.000000	*	HOw does that logic work in terms of demographics and those of the prison population?

t1_duet4wx	-0.979500	*	Yeah, I discovered that with the post I submitted yesterday. Yikes. I could practically smell the vodka in that thread.
t1_dv2dfxv	-0.599400	*	How is that the case?

t1_ducsx00	0.102700	*	Who said they were not caught? They were caught but everyone does it ... this is NOTHING NEW! 
t1_dupgbwx	0.000000	*	It went well for 28 years.
t1_dupg0ha	0.153100	*	This might just be me being an amerifat, but 250 operational tanks sounds appropriate for Leichtenstein. Please tell me you are missing multiple zeros from that figure in regards to Germany...
t1_duety1a	0.126500	*	Cute. 
t1_dufy9f4	-0.892000	*	The Brussels bombings, being considered the go-to terrorist hub of Europe. Not much huh? Some things are not so easy to see until their right in front f your face, but they're still there
t1_dudti55	0.296000	*	Well, yeah, yeah it is. Literally killed in her own home. This guy at least provided some provocation. It would still be fucked for him to be killed for it though.
t1_dv3efq6	0.000000	*	That's awesome, but still not high enough compared to older people turnout.
t1_duupui4	0.421500	*	So much emotional baggage and strawman, wow. He said literally nothing of what you're accusing him of.
t1_dv4z1ot	0.076200	*	And? Does that somehow make the current corruption okay?
t1_duppfa1	0.000000	*	That would make too much sense! What are you, a Marxist!?
t1_duphxnv	0.000000	*	Could we have links please?
t1_dv01g64	0.258400	*	Ahh, yes, effectively murder the people that will die off starvation because of that. Perfectly reasonable.
t1_ducs9yz	0.881300	*	Oh, the new talking point is that Trump was joking about having all the non clappers executed.   Because that is sane and logical for someone with power to do
t1_dufa7iv	0.000000	*	NOBODY EVER TELLS ME!
t1_duhfr3j	0.000000	*	Just wanted to point out that almost all state and federal prisons have removed workout equipment, they do not want the prisoners getting fit and in shape.
t1_ductoq1	0.781400	*	It says at least $1,000. So that just sounds like the bottom threshold for this law.
t1_dv4h12r	0.177900	*	Not mass shootings. All intentional homicides. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate  And again, I don't favor bans.

t1_dur2qv6	0.000000	*	Everything.

t1_dux5zip	0.000000	*	If the spouse was complicit in the abuse, yes.
t1_duxkmdh	-0.202300	*	If you want results, of course. Waging a war on drugs while giving people due process is never going to work.

t1_dupgfoe	0.000000	*	That's how we do it in German. Many languages have different symbols for quotes. In French, you use xab [quote] xbb for example.
t1_duo5crc	0.510600	*	Ooooor they are just new to Reddit or made a new account. I've been on this site for years, guess what though? This current account is only a few months old.  
t1_duqvq80	0.476700	*	I never said he was a nobody. A nobody would never have been investigated. He was not critical part of the campaign. As I said.

t1_duct5x7	-0.266300	*	What do we say to news organizations and political parties that have doubts the Russians were involved at all?  This seems to not move the needle at all. 
t1_dufhumn	0.000000	*	So, preventing people from mutilating a child is now nazism. Til.
t1_duyxo88	0.077200	*	Yea man. They dont have shit on Trump. Even if they did, I seriously doubt anything will come of it.    When has a president ever got into serious trouble?  
t1_dujjaun	0.000000	*	I refuse to believe that this is a natural reality. Humans cannot be this stupid. This must be a simulation.
t1_duq5gke	0.000000	*	If he has a broad scope, then why hasn't he come up with any Russian collusion?  Is he saving it?  For when?  This is all Mueller could charge them with because that's all that's there.
t1_dus3uq1	0.000000	*	Which fields? Maybe this is the direction my life's supposed to go
t1_dujincz	-0.771700	*	Red states are statistically uneducated.  The defunding if education in red states will go down next to the southern strategies as one of the GOPs most brilliant strategies.
t1_duzdbsy	0.291000	*	Leave it to a this guy to not know the difference between a pussy and a uterus and ovaries.  And your team wants to legislate women's reproductive health?!?
t1_duft5mo	-0.496300	*	It is sensational. Even if you're the most careful, defensive driver in the world, your chance of dying in a car crash is dramatically higher than your chance of dying in a plane crash.
t1_dueacpu	0.000000	*	he represents Republicans
t1_dv1sw3u	0.000000	*	Nearly all the aluminum billet consumed in the US is domestic. Not mined but melted in the US.

t1_dud2uko	0.000000	*	Thats nice, that means fuck all.
t1_dv4l281	-0.571900	*	Correct. Rich people want the poor to be racist, because it allows them to exploit society and steal wealth.  Every problem in our society can be blamed on rich people hurting poor people for profit.
t1_dv3zu6f	-0.612400	*	Quibbling over that particular detail is a distraction tactic. The type of grenade is less important than a soldier opening fire on noncombatants. 
t1_dufklw1	-0.476700	*	iirc they also attacked a french navy flagship once
t1_dujqqb1	-0.701800	*	Thats because there is a low grade civil war in the UK. The rulers dont want Brexit at all and are determined to undermine the vote. 
t1_dv019j8	-0.859800	*	Such losers not having a mass shooting for 22 years. The country is so repressed they don't have active shooter drills in schools!

t1_duei3vh	0.340000	*	We do. It's called *war*.  It tends not to end well, in most cases.
t1_duhhnli	-0.599400	*	But that much heat kills the elderly, why don't they just go to Wyoming or something?

t1_dunk6yd	0.000000	*	That type of marriage only existed in post WWII first world. Everywhere else, both man and woman worked, with the exception of the upper class.

t1_duqqut9	-0.767800	*	This doesnt make any sense, Russia and Trump worked together to win the election according to r/politics and this sub, so there is no reason for Trump to attack his friends
t1_dv26hfx	0.000000	*	They were never in it for the free trade.  They were in for the racism, religion,  and guns. 
t1_dv1ueui	0.000000	*	Can't kill 60 people from 500 yards with that flame thrower. Can't buy lawn darts, either. It will be okay. 
t1_duzt677	0.670500	*	It would be plastered over headlines the world over. The fact that it isn't right now should tell you something about the agenda of the media in general.

t1_duwmzgp	-0.286100	*	Get a union, or keep being a chump. If your profession is full of wage slaves, maybe don't agree to the bullshit and then demand the bullshit roll down on to nurses and nursing assistants.
t1_dulolk1	0.000000	*	He's got quite the work ahead of him though. He's basically going from the 15th Century to the 21st.

t1_dv3436w	-0.169500	*	They should drag the Reddit admins in front of Mueller to get bent over. 
t1_dv1rxto	-0.458800	*	Canada did this to the Politician who keeps pushing the softwood lumber dispute. It was a Dem from Oregon so they went after industries in Oregon and imposed duties. 
t1_dv1rhae	0.440400	*	Flordia is a big swing state.
t1_duylzx3	0.000000	*	So we hear about collusion for one full year with zero charges. Time well spent. I heard bigfoot has been spotted in northern Washington state. Maybe we get the fbi to look into that. 
t1_ducoqd5	0.778300	*	Coffee is no where near as bad as energy drinks. For one thing a little bit a day can be good for you.  It also isn't nearly as easy to drink so much it gives you a heart attack.

t1_duphg5l	-0.735100	*	Yes, but it is largely neutral on emissions since it seems to mostly replace nuclear.  The most important is to reduce emissions.

t1_duwqnvi	0.025800	*	And all the FSB security guards dismissed 400 kilos of suspicious cargo laying around in the controlled territory. And the ambassador reported it only when Argentinian police stared raising questions.

t1_dugpqja	0.750100	*	THE SPICE was a liar, but at least he wasn't a genuinely obnoxious sack of shit. Sanders is second only to 45 himself in terms of sheer pathetic.

t1_dv3zu6f	-0.224700	*	Quibbling over that particular detail is a distraction tactic. The type of grenade is less important than a soldier opening fire on noncombatants. 
t1_dv40cfp	0.000000	*	No u.  You're amazing <3 You're like sunshine on a cloudy day.
t1_dux3t6d	0.000000	*	To be fair, it wasnt holy or roman either.

t1_durwvm9	0.636900	*	In this case it is explicitly legal though. Doesnt break campaign finance laws.
t1_ducfk7w	-0.690800	*	Why is it necessary to chase the orangutans? Do they damage the palm trees?
t1_dux4w9s	-0.401900	*	It was totally clear that no japanese civilians would die during a land invasion. I mean, roasting a few beforehand worked better.
t1_duwp535	0.000000	*	Very ironic considering taxes on doctors are about 50% (combined fed and provincial) here where as US doctors aren't even close to a tenth of this...

t1_dugc4i2	-0.729500	*	Yet the new government in charge wasnt even elected. Go figure.
t1_duuof9n	-0.195200	*	I see. So theyre valuable, but saying just the one shark generates millions of dollars is definite hyperbole. 
t1_duie9si	-0.794300	*	Lol someone isn't informed. Xi's family might be corrupt but he's squeaky clean. You don't become the president with corruption on your ass. There is nothing on him.

t1_duhlenf	0.299600	*	Not really. After the schism Judeau-Christian values are basically what led to the enlightenment and are what modern society is built on in the West. Ignoring that is pretty stupid. 
t1_dv3t2ub	0.509300	*	Gonna do it anyways I like being followed
t1_dv3ul6l	-0.795300	*	Funny how the typical user who posts in r/T_D can be found posting in other subs, like in this example, yet you still accuse them of hiding in their echo chamber. It really doesn't make any sense.

t1_dufs57z	-0.526700	*	Except they fucking don't. They have a letterbox and a few lawyers here. That's it. That's all they need to evade taxes on their profits.
t1_dug5k9w	-0.951000	*	It's not a joke. Reagan happened once, and everyone let themselves get suckered by Trump. I'm not surprised at anything Americans do anymore.

t1_duzx8tv	-0.271600	*	This is why the kulaks were shot.
t1_duka5or	-0.401900	*	No. The Russians would not be fucking with our next elections as much, the environment would be cleaner, and poor people would have more of a chance to succeed in the US.  
t1_dubz7wc	-0.100100	*	If it doesn't link directly to the image then it's probably designed that way for a reason (I.e. piracy). Inspect element is a good way to find it if you really want to though

t1_durk559	-0.613600	*	What about all the weapons we can't have like explosives? Chemical or biological? Scalia altered the right to bear arms to mean something a bit different. IIRC. 
t1_dusk1ue	0.000000	*	The wall is dumb but America 100% could force Mexico to pay for it.  
t1_dujhxhj	0.000000	*	No, a foreskin. 
t1_dv464ch	-0.571900	*	How so? Does a man who tried to groom children into committing terror attacks not deserve a brutal stay in prison?

t1_dugtksx	0.051600	*	Russians aren't by default terrible. The government of Russia is doing some pretty terrible things, but it's kind of racist to attack Russians in general.

t1_dv0f78a	0.440400	*	well its not Muellers fault about the fraudulent dossier and the corrupt FISA warrants so that part of this joke is not on Mueller.

t1_dun3gwn	0.549900	*	I still hate that we're calling Russian agents trolls. They're definitely more chaotic evil than chaotic neutral. Normal trolls  like do it for the sake of trolling, not for a political agenda.

t1_dv3h2o0	0.318200	*	Not the case for everyone. Guy I know went away 4 years for attempted Murder, came out vowing to do whatever he has to not go to back to prison because its so awful
t1_dugsp9p	-0.373600	*	If he doesn't then he's a fucking moron, the case against Manafort looks incredibly solid, if he wants to at least live out his 80s or something out of prison he should cooperate fully. 
t1_dugto2c	0.000000	*	Oh come on, google definitely knows whether you're pro or anti trump.  The Chrome browser on your phone is proof enough, open a new tab and just scroll down.

t1_dv0xbih	-0.859100	*	Imagine they had compared her to a pedophile and in response she started tweeting child pornography. Would it still be absurd?
t1_dv0mekf	0.000000	*	I enjoyed the episode, but couldn't they just throw a shirt over their head? The bees used facial recognition software, so if they can't recognize your face don't they just go away?

t1_duzt677	0.000000	*	It would be plastered over headlines the world over. The fact that it isn't right now should tell you something about the agenda of the media in general.

t1_duzsy9v	0.822500	*	Its definitely not anything to make a career out of. I built my pc before all of this mining hype started. I figured since I already have the power, I might as well take advantage.

t1_duqkojy	-0.250000	*	It's madness that the penalties are so minor. Some weed dealers have spent more time in jail than these people who are betraying our country. What exactly are American Values these days?

t1_dv3zu6f	0.000000	*	Quibbling over that particular detail is a distraction tactic. The type of grenade is less important than a soldier opening fire on noncombatants. 
t1_duet231	-0.978400	*	Because vigilante justice is known for always being right, and there's no way that an innocent person would be blinded via this method, right?
t1_duomzis	-0.542300	*	They let us keep nukes in Turkey. They are also one of our few allies in the area. Genocide is only a bad thing if you are our enemy.

t1_dui860o	0.571900	*	Depends where you draw the line of upper middle class, and rich. The top 1% pay over 40% of federal income taxes.
t1_duz9v3a	-0.670500	*	Yeah because you would know
t1_dufo2ub	0.000000	*	That all makes sense as far as it goes, but how do planes not have some kind of 'You are pointing this thing at a freakin mountain!' alarm?

t1_duhj29u	0.000000	*	It's leverage, he testifies against Manafucked, who in turn faces a long time in jail and is motivated to flip on Trump. It's dominos. They may not even need them at this point though.

t1_duboyfx	-0.875100	*	Idk Chicago has pretty strict gun laws and it's doing them no good. Gun control would've worked 60 years ago. There are too many unregistered guns now imo. Mental health care is the real priority.

t1_dupljyu	0.361200	*	You can't rely on the police when you need them either.  At the most recent school shooting there was a fucking cop at the school and he ran and hid while children were being murdered.

t1_dutyvle	0.000800	*	Yeah this data makes me less concerned about the jump this year, but more concerned about the jump from 2009 to 2010.  Each individual year from 2010 to 2013 saw more cases than 2007-2009 combined.
t1_dv1wuq3	0.791700	*	We literally are a self sufficient than any country in EU. Name a country in EU that's more self sufficient than US

t1_duq5equ	0.000000	*	This needs to be the only reply to whataboutism
t1_duno8n5	0.000000	*	He gets arrested pretty much constantly. He's a great punching bag for Putin to use as an example to warn off other people from trying to oppose him.
t1_dv1wjzt	-0.542300	*	I can understand some morons in the US liking him because they believe his bullshit, but I never understood the foreign people who like him and say shot like MAGA.   That doesnt even make sense.

t1_dv0kh9e	0.000000	*	No no, the proxy wars were over the VPN.  It was internet wars.

t1_duotnu4	0.000000	*	Explain how the Armenian genocide isnt a genocide. I read your entire comment and it sounds like you were trying to rationalize the killing of 1.5 million people. 
t1_ducsd9z	-0.886000	*	Actually just the opposite. The findings clearly states that no American was found of any wrong doing or illegal activities. Sounds like Trump is the victim same as other candidates

t1_dv5s71i	0.757900	*	How on earth would this ever get to court? The US has no jurisdiction in Russia. It's a complete legal farce for the US to indict Russian citizens for posting on the Internet from Russia.
t1_duzgiu4	0.000000	*	The real question is why would you go through with Brexit. Just pretend it never happened and move on, it's not that hard.
t1_dudgrd2	0.128000	*	Yup, his son knowingly with someone who had ties with the Russian government to get information from them that would hurt Hillary. That's shady. Did Trump know and did he approve of it?

t1_duujq0l	0.765000	*	You're ignoring his actual point to make a quick jab, though.   China very much likes to *present the image* that they promote human rights. They pay the *concept* a *lot* of lip-service.

t1_duqkojy	0.401900	*	It's madness that the penalties are so minor. Some weed dealers have spent more time in jail than these people who are betraying our country. What exactly are American Values these days?

t1_dukt3fu	0.000000	*	Speaking and understanding are two completely different things. Whenever I deal with support for work, I try to break it down to the simplest form, and even then it gets screwed up.

t1_dv1r9px	0.636900	*	Oh yeah absolutely.  Agree with that entirely.  My only point is that blaming parents for the current state of microtransactions/loot boxes is a bit misguided.

t1_dv01g84	-0.171400	*	I can get behind saying it could get that bad if things don't change, but saying this one action is as bad as apartheid is just flat out untrue.

t1_dugecb2	0.401900	*	Drug use will certainly exacerbate mental illness.   But, do you really think a mentally healthy individual would ever try crack in the first place? 
t1_duxj61n	0.000000	*	Because they're Russian.  Would a decent American run like a bitch if persecuted by their government?  I'll applaud anybody that stands up to a rifle with nothing more than a middle finger.
t1_duwut93	0.624900	*	Sounds to me like residents need to unionize and demand better conditions/pay to even things out. 
t1_dv3z6wv	-0.051600	*	There's been a bunch of mass extinctions and there will be a bunch more. No need to feel guilty about it. That's how things are.

t1_dusxnip	0.273200	*	I thought of this the second he was elected. The writing is on the wall for it with the military parades/praise and how he invokes God whenever his approval dips. It's only a matter of time.

t1_dur1gs2	-0.757900	*	Wrong! Terrorists are paid thugs. They work for highest bidder. In this case, China funding Pak against India. It's a simple 2+2.

t1_dukb6ah	0.000000	*	Arguably not, as ISIS originated in Iraq not Syria, so technically they'd be rebels in Iraq but foreign invaders/terrorists in Syria.

t1_duw15lk	0.140600	*	It's easier to wrap your head around a stupid Trump tweet, as opposed to the drastic hell on earth we're inching towards. Fuck people who think this isn't happening.

t1_dv39e2c	0.440400	*	Canada wasn't it's own country back then.  Either 1840 or 1867 depending on what perspective you take, but most commonly thought to be independent as of British North America Act of 1867.

t1_dukadlq	-0.476700	*	For what tho
t1_duxfqgy	-0.242700	*	No, it's people carrying on in this thread like their countries have never done anything wrong.  Sometimes we need to look at our own histories before baying for blood.
t1_duop17k	0.599400	*	But Gandhi wasn't mixed race, so according to you, casting Ben Kingsley should have never happened.  Point being, your point is dumb.

t1_dugmycy	0.765000	*	Let him. Pleading insanity is one of the worst things you can do. All it does is remove possibility of death penalty.  Oh, and you can't just plead insanity. It has to be certified.

t1_duusilm	0.868900	*	No. Coffee is a lot cheaper than preventative medical care.  Everyone who can afford PMC can afford coffee, but not the other way around.

t1_dv1rgzm	0.789500	*	Sounds like someone is specifically targeting Canada. Who wants Canada to be pissed at USA? Well, Russia for one.
t1_duohx52	-0.893400	*	Has that been proven already?  He did say to kill his son if his son was indeed part of any drug dealing ring.
t1_dugsp9p	0.585900	*	If he doesn't then he's a fucking moron, the case against Manafort looks incredibly solid, if he wants to at least live out his 80s or something out of prison he should cooperate fully. 
t1_duk8d0p	0.223500	*	~~40000~~  Edit: nope
t1_duaab6e	0.894500	*	The title is misleading, making it sound like Japan as a whole - including the daily people are talking about Brexit.  Heck, even politicians aren't talking about it here.
