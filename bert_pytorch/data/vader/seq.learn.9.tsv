t1_dt0i7rv	-0.599400	*	Yet they replayed the same prank on Lybia and Syria, 2 of the most stable countries in their respective regions.  So no, it's just the US protecting their oil/weapon interests.

t1_dt3nyqf	-0.077200	*	Capitalism is the system under which private owners of capital control trade and industry. Tariffs in general are not anti-Capitalist, but in this instance, where imposed by the Government, they are.

t1_dtgcz7z	0.429700	*	It pains me to see posts like this, that are so incredibly clueless but get upvoted because reddit is comprised mostly of other clueless people.

t1_dshufor	0.860700	*	Today I am shocked to learn  1) A&W still exists 2) They sell coffee (?) 3) They sell breakfast (?!?!!!?)  Is this a weird parallel universe?
t1_dskb2r6	0.493900	*	The first comment is about why Obama couldn't be invited, not Trump. Secret Service is still in charge of protecting Obama. 
t1_dsz5xyj	-0.883400	*	I'm not trying to defend the Turkish government, I loathe them just as much. But saying that PYD represent the Kurdish people or saying that they aren't indeed terrorists would be false as well.
t1_dtul2ce	0.273200	*	Nope, it exists only as a logical consequence of two other laws. It is not explicitly defined in the US legal system, and isnt really recognized as an option. 
t1_dtoesfy	-0.680800	*	Well alienating half your base is probably bad for re-election.

t1_dsp86wc	-0.072400	*	Thanks for enlightening me, I didnt know what it was called in political science language.  If government is the will of the people, then it ought to be structured and operate as such.

t1_dt0iijl	-0.624900	*	So what's the original conflict? Why was it started and why is NATO doing nothing? Or are both sides just as guilty? Any solid, non-biased answers are appreciated. 
t1_dt8vlnm	-0.381800	*	Yea it's extraordinary isn't it? Users are either fully invested emotionally in the far right or far left. There's no in-between, really.

t1_dtekkl5	0.421500	*	The two countries are eerily similar.
t1_dttcfs8	-0.341200	*	Payroll taxes are taxes on workers, not on companies.  The tax is directly tied to you and your income.  Just because you don't see the tax on your check doesn't mean it's not there
t1_dsm3inv	-0.973500	*	yes, and I'm curious to know what the fuck that has to do with the price of a pint of jean paul charles de mendes. sorry, litre of mark duggan. 
t1_dsdv4ls	0.000000	*	They dont take, they earn. 
t1_dtbxbx6	0.678600	*	That's OP's point. It's terrible either way, but people tend to think it's ok if it happens to some inhuman enemy.
t1_dsvcvpd	0.440400	*	It seems that you've had some sort of pro-Trump troll account reply to you, check his comment history, he's leaving dozens upon dozens of pro-trump comments all over the place :P 
t1_dsg2yuv	0.128000	*	It's a losing game, trust me. Sanctions are a slow poison and grind away economies. 
t1_dt5uuef	0.000000	*	Exactly my point.   Anything that confirms this bias is going to be treated as truth, anything which goes counter to this bias is going to be viewed as propaganda likely spread by Russian bots.

t1_dtkvfty	-0.771100	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...
t1_dtgqwuj	0.700300	*	Just because it's canned doesn't mean there isn't money going to conservation. I am not a fan of of canned or trophy hunting but it still generates money for conservation one way or another. 
t1_dts046b	0.700300	*	Because you can choose insurances. And you can pay out of pocket as well. Whereas when the government is in control you have to leave the country entirely etc, if they even let you do that. 
t1_dtvmjzv	0.251900	*	This old tired lie about how it boosts the economy. They've been doing this for how many years? How's the economy there still doing?   Fuck off

t1_dswpr6u	0.082100	*	>Fetus isnt baby for a long time.  But you acknowledge that it is human, at least then. What is your moral justification for aborting a healthy fetus when the mother isn't in any danger?
t1_dsdx08h	0.000000	*	Large cities are also populous and create most of the wealth and prosperity for the country. Flyover territory, removed of its subsidies, would collapse.

t1_dtuj42r	-0.025800	*	Juries are directed not to undertake any private investigations on their own, e.g. looking things up on the internet. If you do so, its likely you would be discharged from the jury.

t1_dstwt5q	0.745000	*	I do, Im asking if /u/apmje does. They said its inhumane to kill anything. Im asking them to clarify which life forms that extends to, because people draw the line in different places.
t1_dsdlmj9	0.202300	*	Democrats are better at pretending to care.  Republicans have figured out that the general public doesn't care so they don't try and hide it. 
t1_dsuh2me	-0.340000	*	We can all make claims here, unfortunately most of the time those claims are false.    Edit: I called and sent video proof. He is being a good sport.

t1_dtfgx15	0.636900	*	It's not compensation, it's a fine. You can only get compensation for financial damage that you can prove, so you only get the money that you lost because of what you sued over.
t1_dsiat2p	0.000000	*	we are I don't think you're looking at doing anything mate. It would seem pretty presumptive for an investigation to be looking for certain sentences anyway, don't you think?
t1_dtczvfx	0.000000	*	We should charge oil execs with crimes against humanity for poisoning the planet, then we should eat them.

t1_dtekirm	-0.938200	*	He's right.  I'm not a vegetarian, but he's absolutely correct that it's murder and it's unnecessary.  You should feel some sense of guilt, unless you're just an animal.
t1_dttg33i	0.893000	*	I know this well. It wasn't so bad a few years back when you could still get noodles for 6p and bread for 40p, now it's all double. Good luck going forward. It's good to see people helping out.

t1_dtsrt10	-0.887600	*	how on earth do you view those two things as connected? 
t1_dszxcmd	0.000000	*	Start in the west. Mostly in the positives here. By the time you start getting through to Saskatchewan it'll be spring then no problem. 
t1_dsvrzox	0.000000	*	No, that's a stricter voter ID law. The other ones you brought up cast regular ballots.
t1_dsgifhs	-0.599200	*	A famine in Ukraine? Color me shocked! It's not like those had ever happened before in the history of Ukraine!
t1_dtvacrp	-0.989300	*	alright man.. we can bet on it. If we're both alive in 20 years and things haven't got to shit, you owe me 5 bucks.
t1_dsq6c0o	0.000000	*	It's interesting.  It started to load for me; I clearly saw a picture of the girl and her brother then it suddenly 404s.  I think something else is wrong there than a true 404
t1_dt6u9q5	0.000000	*	Fun fact over 900 companies claimed to be headquartered in the same office building in downtown Wilmington. Most of the citizens might not know Delaware exists but corporations damn well do. 
t1_dstpxhs	0.510600	*	Do you buy tires or glue or toothpaste or sneakers by chance? Those are all animal products.
t1_dskpr51	0.516000	*	So it's fine ridiculing Muslims that want to integrate into our society as long as you apologise? I'm sorry, but that's disgusting.

t1_dsl6rcd	0.545500	*	>You think I'm joking. (Laughter.)  I feel like he was being dead pan serious the entire time he was talking and the audience was just laughing, so he said this. Then they laughed again. 
t1_dttbsiy	-0.571900	*	Yeah, I could see myself getting into trouble drunk at a bar over this if I visited Krakow about now. I live nearby there. 
t1_dsq8bzl	0.000000	*	why do you think that minorities can't get an ID? 
t1_dtpjp25	-0.049800	*	Honestly its not a big deal. BBC gets funding by the British government, CBC gets funded in part by the Canadian government and nobody bats an eyelid. Russia does it and everyone goes insane.
t1_dtcyq6t	0.000000	*	Pro business - pro money vs. pro people - pro planet
t1_dt7anpg	0.557400	*	I'd watch it. I'm not very proud of that fact, but it's the truth.
t1_dsmpdxq	-0.533000	*	Do you realise that there was a referendum and the Leave won? It's not like the government decided hey, we like those Britain first chaps, let's get out of the EU to make them a favour
t1_dskz1eq	0.735100	*	Maybe when they pave over all of Tibet and have its citizens sucking down Starbucks and speaking Mandarin, the citizens will stop protesting and clinging to their cultural identity. 
t1_dshrlbb	0.458800	*	Supreme Court assignments are for life and outlive Presidents. 
t1_dtnd9kp	0.421500	*	Youre fixated on the fact that pharmaceutical companies make money by selling vaccines and dont seem to care about the merits of the treatment itself. 
t1_dsuxlif	0.000000	*	Look up the WTO riots. Look up Leftist antiglobalism from the 90s. This used to be what we hated. The modern Left has totally abandoned its principles. It stands for nothing anymore.
t1_dsy5o7b	-0.532300	*	How do you think the iron gets concentrated into ores in the first place? Don't tell me God just decided to place ore seams all over the place. There are hydrogeological processes that do this.
t1_dsme877	0.421500	*	You need to be this tall to ride. This is a game only the big boys can ride on. You can go play in the penny arcade games and expect the tax police to come shake you down. Be nice. 
t1_dtjulm2	-0.202300	*	No, just commenting on the circle jerk.
t1_dtduajg	-0.421500	*	It is legal, but that's not mutually exclusive with being sketchy nor is it the same thing as being good. Something being legal just means people with power didn't want a law against it.
t1_dsg03w0	0.000000	*	Looking at you, Bernie or Busters 
t1_dsfbinz	0.318200	*	well thought it would be one for the ol' figures we celebrate in our national history but have a controversial genocidal side. 
t1_dt1c0op	0.592700	*	It's good if you look at it as a union of several states. Not so much if you look at it as one giant country.

t1_dt6memd	0.308900	*	We're talking about Muslims not brown people. Not all Muslims are brown and not all brown people are Muslims. Why are you so racist?
t1_dsip7co	-0.580800	*	Dunno man. Endecja, nationalism, the rise of antisemitism, assassination of Narutowicz, dictatorship of Pilsudski. It wasn't that rose like we'd like to see it.

t1_dt76ktf	0.000000	*	Civilians that don't even understand how most modern technology works. It would be an economic disaster. You might as well try to adopt a country from 50 years ago through a time gate. 
t1_dtqausm	0.636900	*	America is known for bitching about things that literally every other civilized nation is capable of doing just fucking fine. Like having universal Healthcare. Not having guns. Walking. 
t1_dtqq925	0.000000	*	The makeup of the US was vastly White before the Immigration Act of 1965, so that element keeping the US on the cutting edge of advancements was, to no surprise, White. 
t1_dshc1m7	0.296000	*	The British did set fire to the White House. It happened during the war of 1812.
t1_dswnlx7	-0.458800	*	Read the haaretz article then. Also I find it hilarious how you're trying to justify the unjustifiable. The way she described it might be a bit too far fetched, but its true nonetheless
t1_dt56p5n	-0.700300	*	You literally missed the whole point. My point was PRE insurance isnt as high as people act.
t1_dtvrfdw	0.000000	*	Like? 
t1_dssigb3	0.592700	*	When I hear the the Old Testament doesnt count anymore, I ask so the 10 commandments are no longer valid?. Its usually met with insults.
t1_dslzrsv	0.000000	*	Great response and good counter argument, you immediately loose any value in this discussion and I will not waste my time messagiing you further.
t1_dtwnkmf	0.820400	*	I think you just have a superiority complex and don't like people saying things about people you personally disagree with.
t1_dsixkqc	-0.612400	*	Or are a person of color, female, LGBTQ, poor, mentally handicapped, or any combination of all those. Other than all that, its great, and safe here.
t1_dtbxayb	-0.393900	*	That's ignorant
t1_dssmswp	-0.447900	*	well, much of Aleppo is like that still.  massive destruction was mostly on the frontlines that split the city into east & west. though sadly the old city got nailed really hard.
t1_dsv7w8f	-0.698300	*	I don't know, ask the USSR.   Salami tactics, expand their buffer. Make them a new Ukraine. 
t1_dtogm3b	-0.699600	*	So now it's a contest to see who killed more.  And how many starved to death because of communism?
t1_dsfootl	-0.226300	*	They had congress back in the first year of Obama being in office and managed to fuck up single payer option for Obamacare. I have 0 faith in them to do whats right 
t1_dskdfwv	0.000000	*	Othats euthanasia. In the food instury you are killing animals that dont need to be killed.
t1_dsff4eq	-0.644000	*	Okay. Cause obviously the U.S. *wants* more tension with NK. That makes so much sense. 
t1_dsyizx1	0.877700	*	I think this is a big reason why I enjoy watching Mr. Robot. It doesn't feel like it's fake.  It also has one of the best opening scenes to any show I've ever watched. 
t1_dstr9lu	0.000000	*	70 years ago they were just Arabs. Palestinian identity is relatively new.
t1_dstr0cz	0.000000	*	>  it doesn't use the flag colors from either south or north Korea   South Korea has both white and blue. North Korea has white.
t1_dsipxfm	0.000000	*	I work in a post office in the UK, the postcode in this country tells you which street and which side of the street to take the mail to, and the house name/number says which building. 
t1_dtuc99j	0.000000	*	No, Israel defended itself when attacked. 
t1_dtvrh62	-0.493900	*	IIRC talking on the phone while driving using a hands-free device isn't any safer than holding the phone in your hand.

t1_dtec7kn	-0.735100	*	Yes Im saying. The ones that want to die for that cause. They can. So we have less humans. 
t1_dtkuobz	-0.735100	*	America has a great education system, most choose not to take advantage of it. I see it as a cultural issue more than anything. 
t1_dsnvc2i	-0.930800	*	> unsubstantiated feeling of vague oppression  You can't be a Republican and not notice the LGBT-phobia among conservatives. That's impossible.
t1_dthaamw	0.926500	*	Living yes, human no. Edit: I meant a person. A fetus is a human in development, not a person.
t1_dsjx1pe	-0.493900	*	Wasn't the organization/person who organized the rally a known white supremacist? 
t1_dt45pw4	0.421500	*	I stated facts. Thanks for conceding.
t1_dtw510t	0.897900	*	Except they aren't that distinct anymore, and plenty of highly educated people have been shown to outright lie and spread disinformation on behalf of these other less trustworthy entities.
t1_dth1ceb	0.458800	*	Chinese govt cant arrest me here in the us.  Us govt can, id rather get spied on by chinese govt.

t1_dsh8fwb	0.757900	*	Sears was actually ahead of the curve at one point. They started the Prodigy online service with IBM back in the day before the Internet was a thing. Then they blew it.
t1_dt99dyb	0.340000	*	What is the thing I was doing? I haven't posted here before, just observed that he whined a lot about people using ad homs against him, and within the next breath, will *throw ad homs at people*.
t1_dtuyp2o	-0.493900	*	Elon himself said that it looks too real in the press conference. Apparently colors look more crisp in space due to the lack of atmosphere.
t1_dtf6mym	-0.805600	*	Spiritual abuse is a real thing.  But it's not representative of the whole faith. 
t1_dt2hxki	0.000000	*	Give an short list.
t1_dts046b	0.090000	*	Because you can choose insurances. And you can pay out of pocket as well. Whereas when the government is in control you have to leave the country entirely etc, if they even let you do that. 
t1_dtczvfx	0.200300	*	We should charge oil execs with crimes against humanity for poisoning the planet, then we should eat them.

t1_dseut8a	0.721900	*	That's just not true. Ringling used to tour with a whole team of veterinarians, many of whom had been working with the individual animals for decades. 
t1_dslct1s	0.282800	*	Nah, my sister inlaw did though. I didn't pay 20 euros to pour my own beer, lol. 
t1_dsy7kw7	0.102700	*	A capitalist did it, their nationality doesn't matter. The notion that working people have anything in common with the owning class of their nation is false. Working people have got no country.
t1_dsl0zje	-0.645600	*	No I didn't. Pay attention to the context of the thread please. 
t1_dtivg4u	0.790600	*	So we should put mattresses on park benches then?

t1_dst4wyn	0.077200	*	Except other currencies are based loosley on a countries gold stockpile. Crypto has nothing of value holding it up but other peoples demand.  Good luck. Hope you make money
t1_dsv6njb	-0.996100	*	Has Trump put a stop to this or is he continuing at a greater pace?  MOABs again?

t1_dtw14j6	-0.085700	*	I guess we will have to see what it says in a few years. The sharp drop in 2015 seems to kill the upward trend at least!

t1_dta0rf6	-0.958800	*	20 unarmed black people die in 2017 from police. More white people died to police. We are literally talking about 0.0001% of police interactions and acting like its pandemic.

t1_dsue6yq	0.273200	*	You are a genuinely intelligent person.   Chivalry is not dead.

t1_dsmdz3l	-0.180900	*	Tibetans born in China are Chinese citizens, Tibet is a Chinese province. Your statement doesn't make any sense 
t1_dsfox3v	-0.659700	*	I mean, my world and everyone I know has a great life thanks to the boom Clinton created, and obama taking us out of the recession.
t1_dsfliv8	-0.077200	*	You do realize both Republicans and Democrats are attacking Trump?  And what is your polices beliefs?

t1_dsl4h10	0.542300	*	Quarterly you are correct and I was wrong but on a yearly basis he failed horrendously. The numbers back that up. 
t1_dtcuecl	0.715100	*	So, we're supposed to give praise that 45 stepped in and stopped his corrupt people from doing something wrong? Is this supposed to be noteworthy, and not run of the mill?
t1_dtmzns3	0.000000	*	If you know about it, then don't you think ISIS knows about it?  * Hey jibab, check out what I put on twitter * himal, I don't see anything * it's right there
t1_dt4lz7t	0.168000	*	Major companies like Wal-Mart are firing people. And, you honestly think 3k is going to last you any reasonable time?
t1_dsluybl	0.000000	*	Some, I assume.
t1_dtd5tot	-0.403100	*	Of course it will get worse and soon but my personal choice won't affect anything. /r/vegan have achieved precisely nothing, their numbers are so insignificant that they might as well not exist. 
t1_dsl1uoi	0.000000	*	We are. We're laughing.  EDIT: My mate Annabel has a xa310 bet on you've used the term cuck more than once. I reckon she'll win.

t1_dsuwztd	0.771700	*	It matters because you are dodging the question. Immigrants can come from anywhere. But Haiti is a shithole. It's not hard to say. 
t1_dskziw8	0.361200	*	At that point you have to go military coup.  And it scares me to think this is a possibility. 
t1_dt555go	-0.557400	*	Well, erm, the IP laws actually really do help out Hollywood's studios and investors make a lot of money. It comes at a great social cost but they really do like the state of copyright especially!

t1_dsdrics	-0.911100	*	Trump doesn't have to *accomplish* anything to satisfy Trump voters, he just has to make liberals mad and vent about Mexicans and Muslims. That's not hard, or productive.

t1_dtg9e4k	0.599400	*	In Australia retirement is funded by themselves though mandated Employer contributions. This doesn't incude casual workers.
t1_dt6lfqr	-0.204000	*	Indeed. Maybe he can link them before he tries to make stuff up.
t1_dtiff2z	0.440400	*	Shit that's better than my rent.

t1_dsg1tj7	-0.599400	*	Perhaps in the minds of deranged neanderthals. Meanwhile the rest of us enjoy a world that isn't constantly rocked by wars between major powers.

t1_dsotpmy	-0.750600	*	Yes, but it is basically the 6th grade bully in the playground against 1st graders.  We haven't fought a real war against a real power since WWII.
t1_dsuqm7z	0.023700	*	I'm pretty sure the number was 1.5 Trillion OVER TEN YEARS, correct? Isn't it true if the economy keeps getting better than that cost will be covered?

t1_dtenwqq	-0.946000	*	That's always how I've defined murder internally though. And if that isn't the definition of murder, then we should base our system of morallity around what ever that is.

t1_dsk65x0	0.815900	*	The average trump supporter actually fits the profile of the ignorant trash that put Nazis in power and all the trump supporters I've met are seriously racist as fuck.

t1_dtdz7qj	0.709600	*	Sell out is two words when youre using it as a verb.  Sellout is a noun.  When you sell out, you become a sellout... or in the case of a politician, a puppet.

t1_dsuui4m	0.811100	*	I called you dense for implying that should and willing to are the same thing. Which is exaclty what you did before calling the left racist.

t1_dslk9es	-0.397600	*	Yeah, and that's why it's dumb as fuck to use literacy as your argument. That's why I posted the comparison.

t1_dt3dxzd	0.000000	*	I just want a 1000 member House.  Fixing the House size permanently a century ago gave them power not only in the Senate, but also in the EC and disproportionately in the House.

t1_dtokxkb	-0.261700	*	Those groups are generally considered to be, and have always been, their own nations, so no. Also if you don't think that the Confederacy was a racist entity then I don't know what to tell ya

t1_dspe3er	0.635700	*	If you want to stop, then stop. My problem is that the US is using the money for leverage to force a political victory in the UN. Do what we say or we'll let people starve is unconscionable.

t1_dtqj2q1	0.102700	*	Because the link says its 52.5% Caucasian and 29.7% East and Southeast Asian?  So at least one of us is misreading something. I'm looking at Tables of Ethniticies (for census metropolitan area)

t1_dta7t8u	0.612400	*	Yikes, it may be how its done but that seems so shady. Id be booking it my way towards the US embassy before making a withdrawl with cops over my shoulder.
t1_dsl106f	0.599400	*	Or maybe there aren't only two types of people out there.
t1_dt8f6fc	0.000000	*	Por que no los dos? If the world begins running out of water but the US doesn't, you will need the guns also.

t1_dt2iop2	-0.557400	*	To be fair, they'd both end up on trial before anything bad happened, not immediately lethally injected in a van and liquefacted for burial like all the Chinese citizens whose names we'll never know.

t1_dtx3tff	0.421500	*	> We are all very much the same at the core.  There's literally no evidence of this. They, in their own words, are Christian (Dominionists) first, Republican second, and American last.

t1_dtadw5s	0.000000	*	Jpost's ideological leanings are exactly in line with the Israeli right wing government.   It's like Fox news and their pro-trump stance.

t1_dttb3kc	-0.510600	*	We just had a kid and the bill before insurance was 18k for 3 days. $1100 out of pocket deductible is what we ended up paying.
t1_dt3bv4c	-0.177900	*	I didn't say you didn't read it.  I'm simply saying reading the article you posted is important because your one line summary can't substitute given the complexity of the situation.

t1_dsl7p9d	-0.599400	*	Not even sure what point or joke youre trying to make.  My CCW ensures that Ill be as safe as humanly possible.  Thanks for the concern.

t1_dtbfgi9	0.000000	*	It isn't a straw-man argument, learn your logical fallacies before spouting them off. If anything it would be a false equivalence, and it isn't even that.

t1_dt55l0y	0.000000	*	In the nicest way possible I think you are completely correct. China agriculture and manufacturing is corrupt on a scale that makes even American and Brazilian corruption look like playground stuff.
t1_dtvee4a	-0.177900	*	You went to Vietnam in 1993 to open up a sweatshop!
t1_dsvjepa	0.510600	*	It's too bad your hatred of Trump blinds you from seeing all the goods that's been done for Americans.

t1_dsx4tux	0.642800	*	Lol dude, you're arguing against a straw man.  The evidence that government programs lift people out of poverty is not so good

t1_dt93p7e	0.000000	*	 How is it sexist? Women have been outperforming men academically for a while. It isn't sexist to state fact just like it isn't sexist to state that men are stronger than women.
t1_dt3i9to	-0.612400	*	Because it's not against specific nationalities, religions. It's against people who commit specific acts that would show a tendancy to not obey immigration regulations.
t1_dtnkjqi	0.518700	*	Ahh I thought it was up to the RNC if they wanted to allow him to run again. Learn something new every day.

t1_dt5yt39	0.000000	*	Exactly. It was their election to lose and the DNC fucked it up royally by putting up the worst possible candidate in history. Biden would have put up a better race even.
t1_dtikp2n	-0.376500	*	Then why on Earth would you want that woman in the white house? If she's willing to do that on a small scale who's to say that she wouldn't do it on a larger scale? 
t1_dt7m97y	-0.894700	*	They might have a decapitation plan.  The only thing we know for certain is that the NK problem is getting worse, fast.
t1_dsdq4pu	0.718400	*	That's called an opinion.
t1_dt733oj	0.160300	*	Oh please, the GREAT majority of illegal immigration is people who overstayed their visas, not people who jumped a fence.

t1_dtg32kl	-0.202300	*	It wasn't 15 years without an increase. Did you look at the chart in the link I posted?
t1_dtjf7at	0.855000	*	I personally believe it's better to respond to an attack rather than start one.
t1_dt91suo	0.421500	*	I know my life sucks. Being able to retire at 51 with a pension, 401k and private retirement funds. My new tax cut, my new car, my nice middle class lifestyle  God what an awful, awful existence

t1_dsusrjz	0.454900	*	Yeah, it's hilarious watching people who presumable support a livable wage also support importing an immigrant slave class so we can pay them peanuts to work in the fields.
t1_dsjhlp0	-0.765000	*	Perhaps the Netherlands actually has a real respect for the freedom of the press and their responsibility to the public, like the United States once did.
t1_dss6ddj	0.000000	*	What is a sun?
t1_dtdux37	0.273200	*	Yeah, like all the emails from Kushner and Ivanka that are on private servers.  Nobody seems to care about record keeping requirements anymore.

t1_dtbyicd	0.495600	*	Ah yes the classic well it would do more if she sent money. Maybe she doesnt have the disposable income to send money so her way of showing solidarity is a facebook post. 
t1_dsh3v7h	0.000000	*	I wasn't trying to rebut anything, and all it took was looking at the first page of your comments to see that you post there. 
t1_dszcg50	0.817200	*	the americans killed most native americans off. You only have a fraction of their diversity remaining.

t1_dtpr06o	0.190100	*	Yeah but that doesn't get very specific. I was hoping for like... a comparison table. You're making very specific claims about chicken, and I was interested in seeing more stuff like that. 
t1_dtdegh3	0.757300	*	It seems like you cherish international law when it suits your goals but if it doesn't suit your goals then its garbage. Why haven't you held the Palestinians to the guidelines of the Oslo Accords.
t1_dt0axwy	-0.296000	*	I get it, and i dont consider it wrong, but it easily gives out the wrong idea.
t1_dtbww4a	-0.542300	*	In Belgium the bomber coated the shrapnel in anticoagulant rat poison so that more people were likely to bleed out while being triaged.  Fucking devious.

t1_dt6ixhk	-0.757900	*	Which is why it's a pipe dream. Communism is impossible without some sort of enforcement.

t1_dtkvfty	0.911800	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...

t1_dszchyz	-0.255100	*	>Israel is doing it so it's ok  Yeah cause Israel is such a country that people should look upon on? I guess Turkey is in awe of Israel's ethnic cleansing techniques. 
t1_dsuusnk	-0.817700	*	ISIS are terrorists so no as even the government troops kill them. But if the Syrian Army attacked and killed American soldiers illegally in their country then they would be justified in doing so.

t1_dt9rshn	-0.735100	*	I dont think obama called himself a minority president, so I am not sure what you mean.
t1_dth7ex1	0.000000	*	watch the OP's video with your eyes. its my last comment to you.
t1_dt33vvy	0.857300	*	Should I be proud that I was born with an XY chromosome, or my parents happened to be citizens of the US? I don't think so. That's just my take though.
t1_dtjbcgy	-0.401900	*	it's really funny how people like you fall back to this garbage so quickly
t1_dtvmgyi	0.038700	*	>(an escaped lion threatens someone, or you want to eat the cow for example)  How are these comparable justifications? One is self defense, and the other is killing for personal pleasure.
t1_dsvrdcr	0.000000	*	Yes, reducing 'love' to 'hugging' is definitely the major issue here.  Tell us, how exactly does one use 'love' to counter Islam or the Nazi war machine?

t1_dsnq4qp	0.000000	*	It is pretty obvious what it is: Anti-religion. Good luck winning that argument. 
t1_dtbb4xv	-0.539800	*	That was before airbus bought it.  Now they own like 19%.  And the plane won't be built in canada, so the jobs they tried to protect are gone.  Meaning they got burned big time. 
t1_dsk8f6c	0.296000	*	There's honestly nothing Americans can do about Trump right now? Jesus, he's not king of the United States. He's really not untouchable.
t1_dtwksup	0.865200	*	Uh... has the island moved?
t1_dswsvp8	0.000000	*	That's probably payback for taking things that *are* Made in New Zealand and re-labeling them as Made in Australia... ;-)
t1_dsze8vw	0.000000	*	Not at all. The Iraq War just isn't an example of why. I wouldn't think it's a good condemnation of Sweden either.

t1_dt7bseh	0.000000	*	you don't know history, HK is well better since the handover. Just look at the figures there. Chinese really developed it. 
t1_dstqz6b	0.025800	*	The Normans settled though, they built forts to make sure the removed Saxon nobles didnt try and reclaim it.
t1_dsjiqui	-0.526700	*	Im a Republican and you seem like you havent paid attention to any politics ever. 
t1_dt4e1st	0.571200	*	Are you able to articulate what any of that actually means and why you think it is so? Or do you only speak in cliches and buzzwords?
t1_dtbwf9m	0.273200	*	Che seems a bit out of place in that list
t1_dsk1b7h	0.000000	*	Anyone have a tl/Dr translation of this?
t1_dtw27f2	-0.616600	*	I have seen no evidence that it's true, and would have no reason to believe it's true, beyond the conservative anti-government, anti-union narrative.
t1_dsrrsm7	-0.510600	*	Individual condemnations aren't really newsworthy, but when 1800 clerics comes together with a joint fatwa, I think it's news.
t1_dt7rass	0.093500	*	My bad it was 2008 when it got down to 1.04... but it's not really relevant to the point I was making anyway. Bit of an odd thing to knitpick.
t1_dsusxj4	0.361200	*	About 6
t1_dsd7s3u	-0.840200	*	I'd say yes, propaganda plays a huge role. But also nostalgia and the feeling of past defeat and injustice still not being fixed.   So Israel's human rights abuses are still a factor. 
t1_dtv8shj	0.709600	*	He doesn't believe in climate change or even understand the fundamentals of the agreement. Logical sense has little to do with it as far as I can tell.

t1_dtaa38h	-0.868900	*	Incited hate   -  Ahh, what a great phrase to build a law around.  Only 100% subjective and abstract!

t1_dso9742	0.458800	*	Yeah, you turned the tables right on me! Master strategist that you are. That was totally not you deflecting right there, you're just a rational, calm being promoting the free exchange of ideas.
t1_dsk4948	0.877700	*	I don't think you do. At all. What shithole country did your ancestors migrate to america from?
t1_dsl3nso	-0.421500	*	I wish I had known about the Detroit show they had last year. Oh well, he's pretty healthy for his age. Next world tour.

t1_dt89t30	-0.381800	*	You said that was the 90s. You now know that's false. Nobody said Palestinians are capable of wiping out Israel. That's obvious to the entire world. Their rockets land in empty fields.

t1_dsy5ip1	0.000000	*	To hell.

t1_dtgkscq	0.465000	*	Don't you miss the days when Iran had a good government and leadership, which made the country forward-thinking and prosperous?  One can only hope they will go back to that.
t1_dsyadua	-0.832300	*	Turkey doesn't control access, Turkey may impede to a degree, but once they declared that Russia can't sail through, I will hold my popcorn.

t1_dsuwklb	0.510600	*	Right, so why?
t1_dswslwk	0.000000	*	And I thought the list of all the titles for Daenerys was unrealistic. If you need half an hour to address a person properly, no wonder it leads to overinflated egos more often than not.
t1_dsp8hp5	0.000000	*	Fucking exactly.  Just use mass drivers at minimum.  Problem solved. No need to even be close the earth surface.  
t1_dt6zqdr	0.000000	*	How that is legal blows my mind.  If a person works 40 hours a week they should be able to afford to live. (Mind you at minimal means) 
t1_dszgtwj	-0.016000	*	Why are you being downvoted....?
t1_dsw6abr	0.000000	*	True, true. I didn't consider the amazon as fresh water for some reason.
t1_dsvato9	-0.883400	*	Then what the fuck is the point of gun control? What the fuck is the point of the war on drugs? 
t1_dsn40a5	-0.929900	*	So when research goes against your point you just simply refuse to believe and then what? Where are your facts to back up your claims?   This is total fake news mentality.
t1_dtkvfty	0.318200	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...
t1_dsw6fq5	0.340000	*	Was that immediately after the Olympics? Bloody hell. 
t1_dttwsc5	0.421500	*	That's a broken link. What is the scenario you speak of?

t1_dtv44tz	0.000000	*	They'd be mad either way since they were expecting the US to give out a lot of money. The difference is the US isn't breaking its word if it doesn't sign. 
t1_dss6ii7	0.880900	*	Unfortunate for them? Seriously? They tried to scam their employers with a fake degree and a fake interview, they are as honest as those Nigeran princes with their billionaire legacy!
t1_dsmzkyp	-0.687200	*	Yet you took the time to answer me and still won't respond to the point the other user made.

t1_dswpr6u	-0.747600	*	>Fetus isnt baby for a long time.  But you acknowledge that it is human, at least then. What is your moral justification for aborting a healthy fetus when the mother isn't in any danger?
t1_dsh55f1	0.670500	*	Dont you think tillerson is better qualified than a random redditor to say his staff can handle more of their own clerical work?
t1_dtfjp7v	0.000000	*	Well that's the problem with not requiring voters to show some ID. We need voter ID now, woudn't you agree?

t1_dsus5i0	-0.405600	*	Immigration is winning the lottery for many families. It really shows how much you're in your own bubble not to realize this. 
t1_dt6lwxo	0.000000	*	It would have been helpful if you at least listed the places where this occurs, but you did not, so I can only guess that you are trolling.

t1_dtlj4bx	0.226300	*	You didn't read shit. The story is well-known to any toddler who follows IP conflict. It wasn't exactly a secret. 
t1_dtdbl63	0.025800	*	It didnt in Russia too, until Putin fixed it.
t1_dtd0sus	0.000000	*	Everyone realizes that Obama can't be president again right? There's a term limit of 2 terms for any one person that's it. He can't take a brake for a couple of years and then go again.

t1_dtliqzj	0.493900	*	Legalizing and regulating drugs makes them far less accessible to children than being able to walk down to the corner and get them unregulated off the street.

t1_dt0j9tl	-0.790600	*	Hmmm. They obviously had a reason for attacking US ships. Whether they were justified or not is another question...
t1_dt7vdq2	0.749100	*	Obama did SFA apart from giving them trucks, training and weapons.  Hillary said that in Syria Al Qaeda in Syria as they used to be called were actually the good guys.

t1_dspn1fc	0.104500	*	My thought was shitty reporting.  Most times I see stock market collapse it dropped maybe 10 percent or something.  Not a collapse to zero or even close to that.

t1_dt7zczt	0.116300	*	I see. Sorry, as I said I'm not a US citizen so this is all very confusing to me. So in short the president is privileged in the face of the law? 
t1_dt7y05j	0.128000	*	Chill out dude. Questioning the ethics of nuclear waste doesn't make me pro-coal. There are other renewable sources of energy. Presuming that I don't give a fuck about pollution is a bit unfair, no?  
t1_dtt3t0x	0.000000	*	Agree with your last point. Religion and learning are not at odds by definition. That wasn't what I was trying to say.  Religious government is though, and very much so in Iran.

t1_dsxu87z	0.931000	*	My point is simple: gun control reduces gun crime. 
t1_dsjpkqk	0.318200	*	It's because resist is aggressively liberal while durkdurk over here seems to like to spout neo-nazi talking points even if he isn't one. Look at both comment histories for context.
t1_dsmf248	0.939100	*	Am with HSBC, they're a fantastic bank. I enjoy that they're drug money and mafia money launderers because the Vatican also does this and therefore my bank is godly.

t1_dtaq0mi	0.525500	*	Looking at central Melbourne and the way roads lead out, I don't think you could reach black in less than 60km. Now, unless you plan to drive at 180km/h, you're not getting out there in 20 minutes.

t1_dsjyfdd	0.000000	*	These arguments conveniently ignore Canada which has better social mobility and has health care, it's not homogenous. It also ignores the fact that most European countries are not homogenous. 
t1_dtjl77z	0.079300	*	So what? You don't remember it. Why do they pierce baby ears? That's past 9 days isn't it?  Religious circumcision is gross to me, this isn't. I see this like cutting off a tail.

t1_dswpt8o	-0.870900	*	>If you have to fall back on extreme outlier cases where the mother's life is in danger to justify abortion as a whole, it shows how weak the argument is.
t1_dtfarrw	0.580300	*	Because one of the themes of the protest was religious discrimination, and Trump was talking about banning Muslims from entering the country.
t1_dti6kft	0.421500	*	Hate Poland cause they're christian. Love them cause they don't accept refugees from shithole Middle East.  I'm torn.
t1_dtrjmok	0.000000	*	Hence why sensible restrictions and safeguards need to be in place. Cars are locked, guns should be locked away too.

t1_dtej0jg	0.000000	*	Is there such a thing as sustainable farming that can be performed on a large scale to sustain civilization? Or is all farming just diverting salt to land?
t1_dsx7znr	0.340000	*	The life and viability of an 8-week fetus is demonstrably inferior and less valuable than that of the human mother. Get out of the way of her family planning. Pretty simple.

t1_dtd9u8q	-0.885600	*	My God. Are you that naive?
t1_dsnwlgr	0.764100	*	Because they still support a Capitalist system with a free market. A strong social security net does not make a country socialist

t1_dsdtxmu	0.000000	*	No point to continue. If I provide more sources, you'll say the same thing because your mind has already been made up.  A federal investigation is enough proof for any unbiased party.

t1_dsjr5fq	0.102700	*	The only ever legitimate opinion on that is that perhaps by dropping it only once or in the ocean it may force them to surrender. But that's it. Invading Japan instead of nuking is a stupid argument.

t1_dsdn7lg	0.624900	*	Same people who sided with Kim Jong Un because he said something bad about Trump.   People would uphold Hitler as the moral authority today if he said Trump was bad.

t1_dsuovjb	-0.273200	*	Read the title. Does it say the  Trump administration is barring all Haitians from the U.S. or just those coming here for low-skilled work? He still didn't say only white people are welcome here.

t1_dtnbjt5	0.226300	*	Seeing as I am an American, and according to Websters Dictionary, its primary definition is to watch over an exam in British English, that makes sense. We call that proctoring here.

t1_dtaibd4	0.658000	*	I've found people would often substitute Anfxfchrer in contexts like your story to avoid the whole Hitler thing. As I got older, shortly before my Abitur and at Uni, we'd use Group leader too.

t1_dshcqg1	0.361200	*	It's a graded hike and there was ample warning. It's not like it happened over night. Also, Alberta over the last couple years raised their min wage over 40%... Not a peep there

t1_dshpng7	-0.458800	*	He ordered the Second Intifada which resulted in the murders of hundreds of innocent people. It's disgusting how you can't see the hypocrisy in defending this.
t1_dt9euaq	-0.571900	*	He would literally turn this country into a Theocracy with a Republican controlled Congress. It'd be Christian Sharia.   Trump is a moron, Pence is outright dangerous. 
t1_dtggalb	0.000000	*	Thrre's your problem: regularly on facebook. Most people on facebook are unaware of real goings-on because they're too busy sharing minion memes.
t1_dt5bms6	0.992400	*	Hahaha! Now you're backing out of your statements by claiming you've been sarcastic and ironic all this time? What an easy way out instead of actually challenging your beliefs! Good one :D
t1_dshcugv	0.000000	*	Yeah, talking about population or economy? Rethoric question, since you are wrong on both counts. Here you can find statistics, have fun. 
t1_dtevt1q	0.000000	*	Yeah to me bro is pretty much a gender neutral term at this point
t1_dsi3045	-0.704400	*	If that's the case, shouldn't our objective be to constrain the power of government?

t1_dsnf5si	0.895500	*	If I recall correctly, Bush was only told that someone flew a plane into the WTC. I do not believe he quite understood exactly the scale of catastrophe it truly was.
t1_dt2iw57	-0.359500	*	Like in 2013 when Obama was President?
t1_dswl11l	0.542300	*	What if I'm against abortion and vehemently advocate for supporting the child, even if it means the state stepping in and covering all costs
t1_dtfeqcn	-0.742100	*	Well, if you dont understand the reference then let it be, and take the description of it. Or you could challenge the meat of what I commented and not the red herring.
t1_dtwgzp8	0.801600	*	That sounds more like a dystopian movie than an approach to dealing with a vulnerable person. What kind of people think this is a rational approach?

t1_dsqj7d6	0.475400	*	I suppose it's all a matter of opinion. What's great about Europe is that you have the option to see something completely different with just an hour plane journey.

t1_dsi834i	0.316500	*	You could be president and the economy would have improved. Giving that to Trump is asinine.
t1_dtfqaj2	-0.584400	*	He wont go to jail, the worst that happens is he gets impeached. Presidents get pardons. Its part of the chain of command.
t1_dtxw254	-0.960400	*	Its amazing how mainstream this sort of rambling nonsense has become. You cant genuinely believe this, can you? 
t1_dt7f0z6	0.000000	*	He's also a Trump supporter.
t1_dsltyhv	0.718400	*	According to ur logic new cities would never spring up...  Why wouldn't Fulton's have interest in moving to those other small 1000 cities with the same proportion as NYC?

t1_dsgtqc1	0.407100	*	>paid in accordance to what you produce  You realise that is actually the Labour theory of value which you guys dont believe in because it is a Commie theory right?
t1_dsh3j59	0.205700	*	Lol, run? That's what you have managers for. A local Tim Hortons franchisee near me earns their profits for doing little more than making the weekly schedule.
t1_dt8uo43	0.361200	*	Carry on making a fool out of yourself and our culture just for some cheap laughs from some Americans. 
t1_dsghkpy	0.778300	*	Ah, I found another ironic supporter.  At least one of the girls was forced to have regular vaginal examinations of some kind, I forget. Weekly?

t1_dsjz348	0.128000	*	A statistic that came from the FBI... Is it propaganda if it's true?
t1_dtvj7wo	0.926000	*	It's called diplomacy. You show your willingness to work toward a common goal and try to stick to the agreement, even if non binding.
t1_dtha48t	0.000000	*	When that persons character is the subject of conversation how else would someone against him speak?   Sad.

t1_dtop5li	-0.381800	*	Also keep in mind that we're seeing that most if not all of the information they used when passing that law was based on lies. I'd love to see a re-vote with the new information we have.

t1_dt1wz0v	0.000000	*	Funny but I vividly recall the 11 years of Sunni Arab insurgency in Iraq that preceded the formation of the caliphate. Do you? Cause if you did you would have little sympathy for them.
t1_dsd8via	0.401900	*	It's 113,208. There, happy? 
t1_dthifjl	0.000000	*	Looks like you are correct there. The RNC themselves never paid Fusion GPS. Your initial post was still incorrect though. The DNC paid Fusion GPS but never hired Steele. 
t1_dswry8x	0.388700	*	Fascism is anti-democracy. The denial of free speech or equal treatment due to political difference. It is the government using its authority to quash a (usually minority) view point.

t1_dttcjxq	0.558400	*	That's the hope, but I can accept that. 
t1_dtghs5f	-0.476700	*	In other countries, unemployment goes up *before* the protests. In the US, unemployment goes up *after* the protests. See the difference?  Edit: btw american protestors do get jailed. 
t1_dsw2xa1	0.718400	*	> (He was endorsed by the KKK for Christ's sake.)   False statements like this don't win you any points.  There was a KKK Wizard who publicly endorsed Hillary though
t1_dt34q84	0.250000	*	The fact that you don't follow Catholic dogma or don't believe it is theologically valid is irrelevant.  The fact is, millions of catholics believe in and follow dogma.
t1_dspf5oe	0.000000	*	Why is what happening now? 
t1_dt45bcr	0.000000	*	Holy fuck, that's a lot of rules.   I imagine for cannabis within hospitals soon they'll begin implementing vaprizers to administer THC and CBOs to patients (in my mind this will happen).
t1_dtvqpzl	-0.273200	*	Its not that you misspoke, it's more that you're displaying your ignorance of the situation.

t1_dt3zpau	-0.353600	*	Why are you talking about reps? The Democrats in the Senate shutdown the country.  Why? So the Democrats can stuff the ballot box.
t1_dt17skf	0.000000	*	>Oh, probably something criminal.  So bullshit then.  Why can't Trump and the Republicans that hate the Clinton's bring them up on charges?
t1_dsn1xqk	-0.944600	*	Why would the birds die? What about fish or people?
t1_dtt66xz	0.642800	*	They'll be fine. 
t1_dthi4dp	0.476700	*	Absolutely not. Mindlessly agreeing with the president is what is occurring in most of these threads instead of looking at the evidence and agreeing with that.

t1_dt43rw1	0.000000	*	Each country in the EU has as much diversity as the entire US.  That's why when you walk around Copenhagen, literally everyone looks exactly the same.
t1_dsfa8xe	-0.401900	*	> This would require ~2,887 huge grains of sand.  We'll never find enough!  What about if we were to use a rotten apple core instead, would that work?
t1_dspcdqm	0.000000	*	... they *accidentally* made a nuclear bomb nearly twice the intended size? How did they manage that?
t1_dshn7cz	-0.571900	*	Technically it is, if the drones are under the control of Syrian rebels, and the US was only gifting the drones to them.

t1_dsyy9sy	0.000000	*	I don't know specifics but the US spends 18% of it's GDP on healthcare.  Most of Western and Northern Europe spends between 10 and 12%.

t1_dt7x7oq	0.076200	*	They're working on it, but fusion [power]'s hard.
t1_dsxugck	0.421500	*	That is assuming god has to be bound by logic. An absolutely powerful God could create a match that he cannot strike, and then strike it, without invalidating the first statement.
t1_dsnx4ek	-0.202300	*	Fair enough, I would just think that people that support him for trolling would actually share his views on policy aswell.
t1_dsv4sd1	-0.296000	*	Is this your best defence tactic for lies that you would like to be true?
t1_dswmux1	0.000000	*	Yeah, and I'm pretty sure nobody asked the Gungans.

t1_dsdafxm	-0.153100	*	Yes.
t1_dt6jvdw	0.458800	*	I went to a catholic school and they never teached me the big bang as a true answer. Although they weren't creationists either they just painted it as a gray area and believe whatever you want 
t1_dthgajn	0.128000	*	Nobody trusts the American Government so why should we trust them with our livelihood? 
t1_dsorrh7	0.000000	*	That is true, but it would leave large parts of the world underprotected. Which means someone else would have to pick up the slack.

t1_dtr89n1	0.273200	*	You don't think that the number of people trying to immigrate to Canada is also proportionally lower? Per capita measures are standard when comparing countries with drastically different sizes.

t1_dsrk9rk	-0.970300	*	Care to elaborate? I'm always reassessing and open to evidence contrary to my current opinion. 
t1_dsydis0	-0.296000	*	You claimed that Israel was paying settlers to settle. I didn't think it was possible for a person to move their own goalposts. Is this gaslighting?
t1_dt36wrh	0.604100	*	Then you better be ready to call most journalists lazy. This kind of sourcing is common, and these reports are likely more true than not.
t1_dsz1e87	0.202300	*	What did your comment have to do with it?  Other than to bitch about people pointing out the US' flaws?

t1_dtnl4gk	-0.918300	*	Because you condone rape.
t1_dswziqz	-0.401900	*	What are you talking about?  The GOP had one of the most politically experienced fields we've seen in recent history.  Multiple term governors, senators, etc.  
t1_dt2gup9	0.212200	*	Nice deflection. Also your comments about alts makes no sense   I asked a question  >where did I say they can raise it to the level of the US?   You can use the \> symbol to quote me

t1_dt6zqdr	-0.822500	*	How that is legal blows my mind.  If a person works 40 hours a week they should be able to afford to live. (Mind you at minimal means) 
t1_dsqq2jh	0.732500	*	No. Counting non voters as anything is a ludicrous idea.
t1_dswjnp9	0.413700	*	Their? You speak as if its all one entity. The fallacies grow.
t1_dsl8slu	0.773900	*	Trump supporters won, why would they become aware. 
t1_dsiis4h	0.000000	*	> Gypsies adopt the customs and language of their host countries  They most certainly do not, at least not most of them. They have their own customs and distinct language. 
t1_dsnxn3d	-0.163500	*	I've seen clips of WILTY on YouTube but have never came across HIGNFY, hence my ignorance.  I'm also an American btw, just in case there was any doubt still.
t1_dt32tz7	0.750600	*	Was not the original released quite shorty if not at the same time? Well, of course, it was better click-wise to focus on the golden shower, while there were less juicy but more credible statements.

t1_dtc40yo	-0.318200	*	After Irma my grandma rented out her generator (she had a spare) to her neighbor for a salmon. lol No stores or gas stations for lack of power made money useless and that was after only a week.

t1_dt1ol6x	0.000000	*	Pretty sure the War on Drugs was his wife's pet project.
t1_dt57yfd	0.153100	*	Good for who? Corporations. Bad for workers whose labor is threatened by cheap eastern markets.   But I guess protecting American factory workers is just populist nonsense, right?
t1_dtnb7pd	0.000000	*	Another Trump Voter who never voted for Trump but is saying all the stuff that Trump Voters say.  Huh, that's weird. 
t1_dss8jwt	0.975300	*	> Well there's nothing that can be done about that  No, there is actually a *massive* amount that can be done about that. A complete policy and taxation change, actually.
t1_dtaq8e2	0.190100	*	While I agree with your points, just one thing: We couldn't really change that much here, AFAIK. Even if we would like to. The constitution is as it is and article 1 can't be changed.

t1_dswp3bj	-0.659700	*	That's like saying well, murder still happens even though it's illegal so I guess we might as well make it legal.
t1_dsff1bp	0.000000	*	Did you hear the one about King Kong going to Hong Kong to play ping pong with his ding dong?
t1_dsmsyvg	-0.807400	*	Yeah, the US certainly has a way of disguising racism and classism underneath the guise of freedom.
t1_dsfgtdk	-0.691900	*	yep, I completely agree, though, today's weapons are much more destructive, so I don't know how secure the world is

t1_dswpv2u	0.000000	*	Yes.. you've mistaken a test rig for a production vehicle. That very plane that you send me in your link, is a test rig.  Maybe you should read about it on the Airbus website instead of on fortune.
t1_dtppgsk	-0.853500	*	He cunningly took the issue from, teenagers are being poisoned by plastic products, to science is pretty good.   No one was criticizing science...  
t1_dsx8knw	-0.585900	*	I didn't say you said that, it was literally a question, and not a rhetorical question, I was asking what you thought.
t1_dska5bx	-0.567000	*	He's probably talking about Americans that are telling him that, not Londoners.
t1_dttnm06	-0.718400	*	I was originally going to frame it back to the cold war because I'm aware that's when it all started, but recent memory draws me back to how they've been able to capitalize on that fear.

t1_dsgfdnz	0.750100	*	i like how you just swipped verse 2:190 under the rug. i suggest you read it from there.

t1_dtu8erd	-0.907600	*	> Which is what i said.  No, you said dropped. You're implying that it has no merit.  
t1_dtsso4a	0.000000	*	Technically correct, but bigoted, xenophobic, racist is so tiring to say repeatedly. Easier to say Nazi.
t1_dto0q86	-0.796400	*	If you were seriously interested in facts you wouldn't be posting on t_d. And seeing as no amount of facts would actually make you change your mind means there's no point in providing them. 
t1_dsmngfc	0.000000	*	OK, so perhaps *convicted* is a better choice of words.  Does it change anything? No. Still no evidence of a massive hoax.
t1_dtjgxkh	0.510000	*	oh my fucking god that is APPALLING. What the fuck. 
t1_dsutjg0	0.000000	*	Like how can you get angry about that? It's like if you showed Americans the Constitution and they called it a mockery of the president or something.

t1_dtafk8f	0.000000	*	Does expressing your opinion require you to insult someone? None of my opinions require me to, so I'm confused.

t1_dsmr3bf	0.817600	*	So? He is right-wing then. Being part of the Democratic party doesn't automatically make you left-wing. In fact, there was a time where it meant the opposite. 
t1_dtk8c1u	0.561100	*	You had it done not long ago, once your penis rubs on your clothes enough and builds calluses you'll probably lose that sensitivity, though I hope you don't.

t1_dsxdcfj	0.324800	*	Because it is the government's money so they can set policies on how it is spent?   Nothing to do with legal.

t1_dtbwlds	0.000000	*	Chill the fuck out 
t1_dtcbz0k	0.964000	*	One, I am aware of all the other stuff but am commenting on this article.  Two, our own government does it to us.  Three, spreading information, even fake news is not a crime.

t1_dsdyv54	0.670500	*	I didn't say that's not how it works. I said that it's still not legal. 
t1_dsnxg3g	0.296000	*	It's not but thanks 
t1_dsi0x5r	0.809500	*	That defeats the purpose of sarcasm. It's not even really sarcasm if you explain that you're being sarcastic.
t1_dto2uia	0.000000	*	And let's not forget Rob Ford!

t1_dsxf211	0.000000	*	>Supporting your argument is even harder.
t1_dspgm8d	0.340000	*	Well, it's not entirely clear yet. It does state that most shared it a few times and a small number shared it hundreds of times, so we are probably going to see very differentiated fines or sentences.

t1_dt523bh	-0.612400	*	And who is going to enforce that? Be logical here. You think there are enough police to troll every private entrance in Ontario?

t1_dsi0320	0.692900	*	Well I think most commanders would happily risk court martial over not nuking London. For NK, it's much less certain.

t1_dtaaj4l	-0.214400	*	Well, if we shoot further and aim for SecDef, we might miss and end up with SecHUD, and if First Past The Post has taught me anything, it's that we're supposed to settle for the lesser of two evils.

t1_dta5i9k	0.680800	*	Trump is actually pretty similar to Erdogan. And Putin. The later two are just more successfull.

t1_dtqdi6l	0.687100	*	I think one has to be extremely naive or gullible to even contemplate that the US government or the President is 'dominated' by the Russians...
t1_dt81syz	-0.440400	*	That's a very specific request. No I don't have any of those on file, but it's pretty well understood how sexist comments contribute to a general attitude of contempt for women by men

t1_dshwthe	0.000000	*	It sounds like you are agreeing with me. The user isn't trying to discredit the evidence of russian interference, so it isn't whataboutism.
t1_dttcw1f	0.000000	*	Is it relative to the population size? 
t1_dtkvfty	-0.510600	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...

t1_dsmb1w4	-0.318200	*	Look at the original comment you replied to. Not an odd takeaway at all. Also, my concern was not with asking nicely, but let's avoid the topic altogether because you seem to be getting a bit touchy.
t1_dt05fdj	-0.585900	*	Rudolph Herzog (son of Werner) wrote a really great book covering all the times humanity basically should've ended because of fuck ups with nukes. But we lucked out. We have no idea what we're doing.

t1_dt0iijl	0.000000	*	So what's the original conflict? Why was it started and why is NATO doing nothing? Or are both sides just as guilty? Any solid, non-biased answers are appreciated. 
t1_dtkuobz	0.624900	*	America has a great education system, most choose not to take advantage of it. I see it as a cultural issue more than anything. 
t1_dsds10n	0.000000	*	Humidity.

t1_dtjs4i0	0.000000	*	I think it's common sense that a random soldier captured in the battlefield is not going to have information like that.  This whole thing sounds like an urban legend.
t1_dsro0rt	-0.599400	*	Yeah it means trying to find a better way than a binary dichotomy you think is inescapable
t1_dsjv8j5	-0.886000	*	isn't his comment kinda like, the opposite of /r/incels?

t1_dta4txn	0.907100	*	Maybe in the states, other countries don't allow the military to shoot passenger planes down. One life on the ground isn't worth more as one on the plane.
t1_dtbm3gq	0.000000	*	The A321neo is pretty much untouched by any 737max jet. We're talking almost 7,000km range and that's not even counting the planned Long Range variant of the A321neo.

t1_dtp3bsu	0.000000	*	RTs hit and miss with their politicized content but their documentaries are really well made.   They should still be labeled though  
t1_dtlavid	0.000000	*	Not always. Some people justify their dislike of Muslims by saying that Muslims are anti Semitic. 
t1_dtoews6	-0.128000	*	Disenfranchisement is an issue.  The Battle Flag is not disenfranchisement.

t1_dtd2vhx	0.000000	*	That's really not how tyranny starts. A lot of countries have democratically elected leaders in for longer than 8 years who never become tyrants.
t1_dtnysty	0.509300	*	Just look at the upvote/downvote ratio bud.   Most people just believe what they want to.
t1_dt6xfs7	0.337800	*	Someone has to pay taxes.  It's corporations or it's you.  If you decrease the taxes on one then you raise it on the other or you expand the amount you are in debt.
t1_dsg1cpl	-0.775700	*	Hard to rig an election that's already decided.
t1_dsl5ob8	0.526700	*	I disagree. I dont hear many members of the GOP standing up to denounce Trump. Silence is approval in my book. 
t1_dsrfpex	0.097400	*	Precisely. Most major retail chains aren't supermarkets.  And I'll just point or the number of votes on the top comment.   A lot of people were wondering. 
t1_dt2o2rc	0.776400	*	The NSA gives no fucks about any ToS you signed. In fact ToS are only relevant between the user and company, most of them aren't read in the first place. 
t1_dtvecnr	0.944600	*	Ukraine is an example of a non-NATO state being directly interfered with by Russia in a way they have never done with a NATO state. It proves that Russia is still a threat to isolated countries. 
t1_dsftp29	0.571900	*	Holy cow, is this true!? Do you have a source for the drunk Nixon story? I _really_ want to believe!

t1_dtcqh0b	-0.542300	*	The idea of a government in exile in a different country is strange to me. Can you really be in charge of a country remotely? 
t1_dsm768r	0.000000	*	That's what Jews thought in Germany too. Didn't work out too well for them.
t1_dsiiem7	0.690800	*	It's not sensationalized at all. Brits have been reaching out to every country they can in the EU to make sure they can keep the benefits of being European. That's all it is. 
t1_dsxa3ob	0.000000	*	Yeah right, try telling the Venezuelans that the rapidly increasing supply of their bolivar is irrelevant.

t1_dtqget0	-0.296000	*	So if people wont boycott on their own accord, you will use political pressure to essentially do it for them?
t1_dtl0ixp	0.000000	*	That time the Nazi collectively punished the Jews and the communists for causing all of Germany's problems. Yeah I remember that... It's the wrong thing to do in all cases
t1_dsklt7d	-0.557400	*	Proof of these illegal immigrants? At all? Any? 
t1_dtbn7wc	0.226300	*	Yep, back to the argument that has been used to ban cigarettes in basically every public place in the entire country for the last decade.  I think that argument has won the day, really.
t1_dtrfzgx	0.628300	*	I mean..if you're at that level it should be kinda obvious though right ?
t1_dswpnev	0.000000	*	 Thanks I learned something new.   Although the line is still arbitrary. Being in pain doesn't make something human or not.   Is someone not a murderer because they killed them in their sleep? 
t1_dthkkkx	-0.925300	*	Dude, you began your post stating Obama was the first president you thought was good at everything. Why the hell would anyone read anything else you say? 
t1_dsoyhy0	0.493900	*	> How about killing all of the people involved in actually participating in finance? That would help too.  Hmm, I guess maybe not all lost lives would be mourned.

t1_dtipm7n	0.685800	*	Presumably because they've been training longer? I can't imagine a random out of shape 50 year old would pick up the sport faster then an out of shape 30 year old...
t1_dt7u3vr	0.394700	*	Yes you can know, learn to read people's body language. You say I think in black and white because you probably can't tell if someone's into you without very obvious signs.

t1_dttev8v	0.000000	*	Biggest irony is that the poor wouldn't even really pay anything towards it anyway, since tax is income-based. 
t1_dtrdgtq	0.102700	*	Im awfully unaware and off the subject, but is dust off pressured air that just blows dust..off? Or something cooler? Could google it but I gave up multitasking for the new year.

t1_dtxzsyz	0.000000	*	Well yeah because they already do that. When they visit Auschwitz for example.  But yeah sure you can come and wave your flag, whatever makes you sleep at night pal.

t1_dsdm7c8	0.361200	*	part of it , is they think that by attacking clinton they can make bernie guys support trump.

t1_dtju1y1	-0.372400	*	The point is that people wouldn't know it was fake.
t1_dt1aws9	0.128000	*	I disagree. An uneducated populace is easy to sway toward not voting in their best interest, which destroys the beholden to the people benefit. See: Donald *fucking* Trump.
t1_dt7gl2f	0.000000	*	Maybe more men are interested in the industry then women. Maybe theres just more qualified men than women.
t1_dskfsab	0.891000	*	Exactly. That's the problem with research today.   Go ahead and downplay it tho. I'm sure your precious research papers you rely on quoting are perfect. 
t1_dt4vv2k	-0.102700	*	Assuming everyone spends as much as you on weed isnt a great comparison either. I never said I had a random dealer  Hes a friend, a grower, and a dealer. 
t1_dtp0ve5	0.000000	*	The Marine jokes come a lot from being the red headed step child of the military in regards to equipment acquisitions.  There budget stems from the Navy so the tend to just get hammy downs.

t1_dt69zvv	0.559400	*	I wont feel foolish in the least. I trust Muellers investigation. Weve already seen the evidence of a cover-up. Which is precisely what brought Nixon down.

t1_dt3qxtu	-0.778300	*	What are you on about? Ive only said that I disagree with a government murdering peaceful protestors. I said nothing about everyone should be democratic.
t1_dta6gst	0.000000	*	But in the context of the article it's not. Also I dont understand your last sentence. 
t1_dswplwk	-0.778300	*	Bishhhhhhh

t1_dtsc5g0	0.718400	*	Riiiiight
t1_dtjh3wk	0.571900	*	I'm sorry but medieval persecution doesn't give you the right to mutilate babies genitalia. Maybe some of the persecution happened *because* Jews were mutilating babies.

t1_dt1ocot	-0.275500	*	It could be an interesting book, but my understanding of the term identity politics is that it's just code for a social issue that I want to dismiss because I don't think it's important. 
t1_dteisg1	-0.510600	*	those things are just not a reasonable ask globally. some other solution must be found.

t1_dtctihk	0.510600	*	That's just a trait of Germany though, not because it's landlocked. I mean the area along the Rhine is extremely fertile isn't it?
t1_dswpnev	-0.648600	*	 Thanks I learned something new.   Although the line is still arbitrary. Being in pain doesn't make something human or not.   Is someone not a murderer because they killed them in their sleep? 
t1_dsk2mqx	0.859100	*	Why not we have the room. And if they can be productive and law abiding members of society, like most legal immigrants tend to be, then why would we exclude them from our countrys economy? 
t1_dt0axwy	-0.051300	*	I get it, and i dont consider it wrong, but it easily gives out the wrong idea.

t1_dtr4zk6	0.000000	*	Doubt there are a lot of jobs for people with degrees in nuclear engineering in Vancouver...
t1_dt30wvi	0.997400	*	Quick tangent question- I'm starting to read Doomsday but never read Rebirth.  Am I gonna get lost?  I've read Watchman a million times, but I'm not that up on the DC world beyond the basic dudes.
t1_dttfw3h	-0.296000	*	Works for preventative care tho - I'll see the GP way more often of it's cheaper. 
t1_dspgk89	0.431000	*	Damn, I probably couldn't stomach watching that.
t1_dtiyl3a	0.562400	*	Completely unnecessary in all cases?
t1_dt69dgm	0.000000	*	Yeah, I'll listen to the German guy that actually lives there, thanks for trying to spread your bullshit though buddy. 
t1_dtdto5d	0.308400	*	Its nothing to do with parties. Some of us just wanted anyone besides Clinton or a Bush. No more nepotism!  Ps. I voted for Gary Aleppo Johnson. 
t1_dsdlxrk	0.991800	*	[Corporate Personhood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood) is also good to know about
t1_dtospnn	0.000000	*	You mean the Russian aircraft that pull Gs so hard they incapacitate pilots?
t1_dshok7p	0.128000	*	I'm sure you would've gotten a different perspective from many local Afghans. You know, the people who live in that country we invaded.
t1_dthjyfu	-0.537200	*	That's not relevant to his comment at all and drags the thread into ad hominem attacks which slow the discussion.
t1_dtaa38h	-0.980600	*	Incited hate   -  Ahh, what a great phrase to build a law around.  Only 100% subjective and abstract!
t1_dt1as2h	-0.932500	*	Neither. While US has its strengths it's severely flawed on almost every level of government.
t1_dtw54yc	0.675900	*	Are you saying Trump is illogical and unreasonable? Or are you still pretending he didn't call Democrats treasonous?
t1_dtpxo71	0.000000	*	Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in White House. 
t1_dtn45ea	0.795100	*	Sorry my bad. Rosenstein did the renewals.
t1_dsk8l2b	0.594100	*	That's fine, but it's a bad system to have H1Bs distributed by lottery. It shouldn't be capped, and if the numbers are a problem the salary or requirements should be raised.
t1_dtjiboj	0.000000	*	You just highlighted the key flaw of democracy 
t1_dsdp53m	0.000000	*	Bruh, why do we drive on the parkway but then park on the driveway?  *hits blunt*

t1_dtrdzjv	0.000000	*	What's your original language?
t1_dt1fjp6	-0.690800	*	Forced relocation is not genocide. Not understanding germs is not genocide. If the US wanted to, genocide of native americans would have been trivial. 
t1_dt1vrm0	0.401900	*	How is that populism? Populism can literally be anything.
t1_dt8g0ax	0.000000	*	Link? 
t1_dstd3nk	0.840200	*	Thank you for the ELI5ish explanation! 
t1_dtx822s	0.349800	*	Thankfully your country has some truly excellent systems of checks and balances and the EU moves slower than those systems.
t1_dtn3vb3	-0.363700	*	Lol so Steele was researching stuff for an opposition research company and didnt know why? 
t1_dt55t8g	0.000000	*	Alabamian here. Alabamians hate Mexicans, so the 10% of us that can read are outraged right now. But hey, at least we're not Mississippi!
t1_dtdx2dd	0.000000	*	At the South Pole the only direction is North. When you are part of a group that is an edge case there can only be two sides. 
t1_dtfi25t	0.542300	*	My mother voted against Al gore because she couldn't see a first lady named Tipper being a thing.
t1_dtup5nt	0.226300	*	Gimme a gold and you got it  Edit: thank you sir. You shall be given the movie rights.  Now then to figure out what people use gold for since this is my first one.
t1_dte1sg2	-0.944000	*	That is not violent, it is just the threat of violence
t1_dswry4t	-0.718400	*	In the context of Trump has MAGA'd because the stock market is up, it's meaningless. It is a massive gain for the top 1 to .01%, but for everyone else, it's not a meaningful metric.
t1_dso8li1	0.140600	*	Just waiting on the rights that Arab citizens dont have
t1_dtrablm	0.000000	*	You're unhinged.

t1_dsgj4up	0.000000	*	I did not and will not vote for Trump or anyone who relies on your line of reasoning. I would rather die and take all of the extortionists with me.

t1_dt9avck	-0.648600	*	> who see meanness and vindictiveness as signs of a strong leader  The god of the Bible is also mean and vindictive. I'm sensing a pattern.  
t1_dsl0kbk	0.421500	*	If taxes weren't collected you'd have no country 
t1_dsdndu8	0.000000	*	And there's still a huge cache of fossil fuels they own that they need to sell.  If people start using solar power they won't buy oil anymore.
t1_dtrfr5k	-0.927000	*	What the fucked does being Muslim have to do with antifa?     Alt left isn't a thing. 
t1_dtgf49r	-0.016700	*	FBI is law enforcement - his bodyguards would just detain him?  Your system is laughable if impeachment has to be accepted...
t1_dtiyyog	-0.389200	*	I mean you as a collectivity. As the American people.   On them individually, I don't know who they voted for and I don't care, since in the end it does not really change anything. 
t1_dsh3ahj	-0.970500	*	sweden is one of the countires that supported and funded these bombing.
t1_dt01iot	0.440400	*	Its not even a fetus at three days

t1_dttpm9r	0.000000	*	More like AI take over 
t1_dtaco99	-0.202300	*	I don't need to know why, but if someone is willing to give me something else in return for my poop, then that makes my poop valuable
t1_dt8xp30	0.000000	*	If this were spun, it's because Donald Trumps personality allows it to be.   If I recall correctly though, there's a named source in Britain saying the same thing.   Not in this article, but another. 
t1_dt4qr03	0.000000	*	it doesnt go away as you stated, my neighbour smokes weed and the scent lingers for months
t1_dt3g8oo	0.568700	*	Well yeah, but people like to explicitly focus on Israel's actions when it literally happens all over the world, just by world powers much more powerful and less controversial
t1_dt5jbw0	-0.655300	*	You have to be kidding, lol. Or trolling.  Either way, not worth my time anymore. 
t1_dsebjnd	0.000000	*	Having the best doctors on call is nice but it doesn't stop you from having an aneurysm in your sleep.
t1_dsk2mqx	0.804700	*	Why not we have the room. And if they can be productive and law abiding members of society, like most legal immigrants tend to be, then why would we exclude them from our countrys economy? 
t1_dsshsdv	0.000000	*	>Need I remind you about the millions killed in the Korean war?   The Korean war that began when the North crossed the 38th parallel & tried to invade the South?
t1_dtbdaro	-0.077200	*	In a parliamentary system like Germany's in the 30's a single party was never going to win the majority of seats on its own.

t1_dtg5olm	0.700300	*	Thankfully that's mostly the core that won't procreate, because that would require a female willing to stand stale cheetos and Mountain Dew breath.
t1_dtjalzw	-0.798100	*	Some religions use psychedelic drugs, but the government had no problem banning the drugs in spite of that. Why should genital cutting be given a pass?
t1_dtop9wj	0.296000	*	No, it is still you. Reading must be hard for you.
t1_dstivxj	-0.202300	*	Kimmy can move the rest of the universe to make the rock appear lifted. 
t1_dtc32nj	-0.077200	*	During a time of peace a nation should just not have a military? And when someone declares war on them how do you propose obtaining a trained military out of thin air?
t1_dtduajg	0.427600	*	It is legal, but that's not mutually exclusive with being sketchy nor is it the same thing as being good. Something being legal just means people with power didn't want a law against it.
t1_dt3fuze	0.000000	*	Lol. Have you ever lived in Delaware?

t1_dtku8y0	0.611900	*	And if you weren't how could you know what it's like to be? 
t1_dtmhgph	0.960500	*	You are right and I would normally agree. But they voted Trump into power. How can one let that slide? ;p 
t1_dt1flvl	0.258400	*	Wow, what a brilliant criticism of my reasoning! Does that apply to the presidential election as well, because there's nothing that says gullible more than voting for Trump
t1_dt6e9dr	0.000000	*	As a heavy nicotine user, not *once* have I ever experienced psychoactive effects comparable to cannabis or even caffeine.
t1_dtgcadb	0.000000	*	Wait, so wait, water is 100% water so it is a 100% wet, but becomes dry because it has reached absolute wetness???
t1_dt9e0q3	0.169500	*	The Penguins aren't that good this year relative to what they've been the last two years.   But the Lightning have been on fire all year. I'm actually really looking forward to a Boston-Tampa series.
t1_dsn9tlz	0.542300	*	> Hiroshima had a total destruction radius of... less than a kilometer, I think?  Just watched Oliver Stone's history last night. It was a 1.2 mile radius, so just shy of 2km
t1_dsqjwv9	0.296000	*	I'm not sure if you replied to the wrong post or were just continuing my question, but your confusion is mine.

t1_dslw9n3	0.295700	*	Does martial law come before or after sharia law?
t1_dtcx50a	-0.927800	*	You are implying that he actually did what the NK government accused him off. Quite a stretch if you know the regime's relationship with the truth.

t1_dtwkl7z	0.000000	*	Oh reallly? I'm soooooo sureeeeee.
t1_dsunzc5	0.585900	*	I think we all know that Trump has supporters and haters in the US. But it's not exactly a myth that there actually are Russian troll accounts all over Reddit and social media
t1_dskie3o	0.000000	*	Trebuchets?
t1_dsohouq	0.000000	*	The order that theyre written in is basically a side issue when you look at how theyve presented it in the article, and when you look at the title. 
t1_dttcyzm	-0.510600	*	Unless your a guy and/or not attractive.
t1_dshd8c0	-0.836000	*	Fair enough, but still, being lumped together with pedophiles leaves a bad taste. It could of been phrased better...maybe? 
t1_dt1eyof	0.683000	*	Mao had been dead for 13 years by the time Tianmen happened, I mean, he did enough awful things, no need to invent new ones.
t1_dt8vorp	0.077200	*	If Trump and May could just be isolationists on an island of two.  
t1_dsz0tgz	-0.548300	*	So what was the point of your ironic Yay free market! comment if the US doesn't have a free market on healthcare?

t1_dtb5w8c	0.493900	*	Yes.
t1_dttngo7	0.585900	*	No, the American way is to go to the emergency room, get it taken care of, and stiff the rest of us if insurance won't pay.
t1_dtnh1us	-0.250000	*	More moving goalposts! Days ago, the memo itself was supposed to end the investigation! Now, at some point, if more information comes out, the memo might do... Something! Hahaha weak sauce man.
t1_dtd5tot	0.000000	*	Of course it will get worse and soon but my personal choice won't affect anything. /r/vegan have achieved precisely nothing, their numbers are so insignificant that they might as well not exist. 
t1_dt63x8w	-0.090000	*	Ok, so yeah, dogs were not originally bred to be companion animals. We selectively bred them and changed them into friends while a divergent group evolved into food. 
t1_dso4n8c	-0.296000	*	You do realize people immigrate right?
t1_dsmx6iw	0.000000	*	What if you travel back in time to the point where there is no river there, cross the area it would be , then travel through time back to the present?

t1_dtkv76p	-0.479800	*	You ignored the UK bit of that guys comment.
t1_dth7as2	-0.250000	*	But you do think theres evidence of it possibly being true? I mean nothing by these questions other than understanding your view
t1_dsff4eq	-0.296000	*	Okay. Cause obviously the U.S. *wants* more tension with NK. That makes so much sense.

t1_dse6bd3	0.631000	*	I didn't cherry pick anything. It can be used for either tense, just like I was implying. Affirmative action is often part of an effort to combat current issues.

t1_dtgpd6s	0.702100	*	What do you mean by a more objective form of government?  I'm also a little confused by your last time... wouldn't a country with shite policies also go bankrupt?

t1_dt1u8xf	0.226300	*	No fucking way you have to be joking
t1_dtu3nlt	-0.335900	*	Women are having their insides regulated and held hostage by a bunch of Christian men in the US.  Doesn't have to be a straight 1-1 comparison of oppression to be a parallel.  Are you a Christian?
t1_dsr27vo	0.077200	*	You sound like the guys who think tax is theft.  It isnt. It is something we all agree to do, for the greater good. This is just another the like that.

t1_dsuil6q	-0.095400	*	It would make more 'sense' to have it go hostile if it *didn't* receive a transmission, if it's supposed to be a second-strike/retalitory platform.
t1_dszfdgo	0.613300	*	You've lived in those countries thus you can make your claims? Or are you just pulling that claim out of your red hat?

t1_dsyych2	0.911800	*	There is free market on procedures insurance doesn't not cover, such as lasic eye surgery and imaging services (MRI, X-RAY, etc.). Because of this prices are lower than ever and continue to decline.
t1_dstj7ec	0.008500	*	Eh, I'm used to it. It's oftentimes funny when a foreigner comes up to you and tells you about how you should live life in your country. I don't go tell a French person what to do in Paris after all.
t1_dsgug0a	0.318200	*	Right, and that's not my point. I am simply annoyed at the very /r/YUROP attitude that always comes up in these articles.    
t1_dtvn1ce	-0.923000	*	There's absolutely no nuance to your views on poverty though. As if you think it's completely in someone's control, even easy, to not be poor.

t1_dt2jsms	-0.778300	*	Wow, you literally have more freedom to move around the  EU than within China.
t1_dsy855y	-0.476700	*	I already addressed the science, if you want to believe in a vast conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of scientists, and billions of measurements then feel free.

t1_dtd7nhi	0.000000	*	You missed the O

t1_dt0gnjq	-0.911100	*	Who defines a terrorist organisation? Is the IS a terrorist organisation? Yes. The RAF? Yes, but not in the same way. Is the PKK? I don't know.
t1_dsmy297	0.000000	*	It'd be a liability (debt), not a credit but in any case it doesn't matter. A bank is not a charity. Handling cash costs money, so it's charged for.

t1_dtvwdpr	0.542300	*	Again, can you state your arguments and not talk in riddles?
t1_dsffjtb	-0.920100	*	That sounds rational. But what happens when you call the bluff? Do they strike forth with nuclear weapons, or become an even bigger laughing stock on the world stage?

t1_dsyziys	0.000000	*	So in Ontario Canada if your child needs pediatric surgery within 30 days the average wait time is 93 days.  THAT would never work in the US

t1_dsftg2q	-0.723700	*	Yeah I know, mostly joking.  
t1_dtdwqqr	-0.714000	*	The problem is that shit *is* legal, but it's nonetheless a really underhanded and cheap tactic to get ahead in an election.
t1_dsnyqx3	0.000000	*	Let me guess, you also credit Trump with the stock market and ISIS being defeated?
t1_dticj64	-0.202300	*	The refrigerator on AF1 costs $24M. A golf weekend at mar-a-lago costs $3.6M. No way that shuttering a military base costs only $2M.
t1_dswyxt3	0.352700	*	Yeah, science *does* have evidence of the big bang. That's why it's an established theory and not a hypothesis. Do you even know what that means, or are you one of the it's just a theory! dumbfucks?

t1_dt4utb2	0.368700	*	Obama called Netanyahu chickenshit and it was leaked by his staffer.  It shouldn't have been leaked.

t1_dstb6y2	0.945000	*	You made some good arguments for the most part, but this is not how autism and adhd work. They do not end if you become less bored or learn more social skills.
t1_dtj6j38	-0.804200	*	No, it was pretty low-key in terms of the religious aspect. Mostly, they just wanted to help poor kids.
t1_dt93p7e	0.000000	*	 How is it sexist? Women have been outperforming men academically for a while. It isn't sexist to state fact just like it isn't sexist to state that men are stronger than women.
t1_dsp3eui	0.463900	*	If we dont divest from fossil fuel by 2050 the coasts will be underwater, desert will spread across inland fertile areas, and there will be mass starvation and wars over water.  Youre in a fantasy.
t1_dszubt0	0.153100	*	Easy to be a philanthropist when you are a billionaire.  Most billionaire philanthropist will never notice the money is gone.   Unless you prove he gave til it hurts, I'm not impressed. 
t1_dsqfosq	0.003800	*	Just to be clear, there was nothing else but a disassembled clock in that case. So much for making a clock.   https://youtu.be/kHk_6Vh4Qeo

t1_dtidg9i	0.000000	*	To be fair, so is a lot of the most egregious commentary on Fox News.
t1_dtw2axg	0.932000	*	What about the costs to society? People who don't have jobs sometimes get into crime to put food on the table. Workers get burnt out and compensate by drinking and doing drugs.

t1_dsgj5fm	0.000000	*	Not to mention the plain and simple fact that Obama isn't President anymore.  Trump is, and the fact that Obama supported it doesn't change the fact that Trump chose to do it on his own watch.

t1_dtc0f2z	-0.429900	*	I wasn't referring to this incident in particular, just to the old myth that terrorists and freedom fighters are the same thing from different view points

t1_dt1dhvh	0.660200	*	A lot of places these days have basically foregone entry level positions in lieu of contractors. That way, they can give you all the grunt work, while not paying you benefits.
t1_dto1l3i	0.599400	*	Yes, but they're pale in comparison.
t1_dsfgyvy	0.153100	*	So, what's your solution? Public funding of the media via television/radio taxes like they have in the UK? Only trusting non-profit media like NPR and the Christian Science Monitor?

t1_dsq190k	-0.599400	*	The CBO is using a Democratic Party statistic and is also terrible at estimating anything. You also ignored all of my questions.
t1_dsycyq1	-0.872000	*	We only need to kill the children of the people with guns, though.  They are the only ones that pose a real threat.
t1_dswbm1s	-0.130800	*	Ok. Ill entertain this for a minute. What is the chemical composition of the fly ash and where are the clandestine airport locations?
t1_dtmijp8	0.440400	*	Almost as if the upvote system is only good for jerking and getting opinions from people who already agree with you, or worse, manipulated by those who want you believe a certain way.

t1_dsrpnho	0.000000	*	Right, people assume that only people from shit hole countries do bad shit. I wonder what would give then that idea? 
t1_dsils4a	0.153100	*	This is bullshit. If you look further back than the last election year you would know this.  And he did disparage Trump.

t1_dsuth91	0.128000	*	Sorry, I should have been more specific.  These Haitians are extremely small fish.  The bigger issue is stopping the agricultural industry from using illegal labor, regardless of country of origin.
t1_dt2qcn5	-0.649700	*	So it's a random coincidence that every political polity that pursued centrally planned economies was run by inept autocrats?

t1_dtoo67n	0.000000	*	I hadn't thought of that, but you're right. Clearly we should start sticking these on pilots, just in case they get their chance.
t1_dsr5i67	-0.585900	*	Mining lithium to make batteries uses more energy than the batteries can ever carry.
t1_dsnv9lw	0.000000	*	Weak straw man argument.   I didn't say anything about how you feel but your comment seems to insinuate that you know how your whole country feels. 
t1_dsn3rq1	0.909100	*	Overvalued the effect of the attack and hella undervalued the production capability of the US.   Also midway. They should have read a book on encryption...

t1_dt2v2c9	0.273200	*	There is no social safety net in China, do that's out no matter what. If you don't have a Hokou (the living permit) you aren't permitted to rent/buy a home, go to school, or work.

t1_dtbo2gn	0.000000	*	You read what he said again, after you read what I said. 
t1_dsutjg0	0.432900	*	Like how can you get angry about that? It's like if you showed Americans the Constitution and they called it a mockery of the president or something.
t1_dsmq5ko	0.000000	*	The two republican senators said they did not hear him say it.  They then recounted a different series of events.

t1_dt77cno	0.719300	*	This is why Trudeau/LPC is still popular: those talking points are weak as hell. Like grasping at straws covered in Crisco.
t1_dsrloq0	-0.680800	*	You use violence for a political gain, while not sanctioned as a military or government force. So it's terrorism.

t1_dsurced	-0.932000	*	I don't really count opinion pieces as news, especially when that opinion is he said this, but we can certainly presume he meant something worse.  NPR's actual news is pretty reputable though.

t1_dt76ktf	-0.071100	*	Civilians that don't even understand how most modern technology works. It would be an economic disaster. You might as well try to adopt a country from 50 years ago through a time gate. 
t1_dsls4pj	0.101200	*	Right? Im over here upvoting everybody. This is the most civil, well rounded and well defended debate Ive seen on reddit in along time. Both sides made me see their points!
t1_dsus8oc	0.202300	*	So then why not just stop giving visas to low skilled immigrants, if that's the problem? Why the dog whistle shithole country list, like they are the source of all low skill immigration?
t1_dsuwbaw	0.000000	*	$$$$
t1_dtwqmot	0.542100	*	It surprises me as well. Too many people only consider their own family and friends lives as valuable. I think it explains most the issues we have in the world I think.

t1_dt0uh1j	0.000000	*	> it won't work.  Can you explain?  EMP is a known, *experienced* phenomena.  Why do you think it won't work?

t1_dsdxuv6	0.599400	*	I'll take a not insane republican too. I'm not sure how thinking Trump is a lunatic who's out of his league marks me as a democrat supporter. 
t1_dt2eep6	-0.925300	*	Thats probably because Snowden committed treason. Ya know, stuff like breaking laws is frowned upon.
t1_dtd1m0w	-0.735100	*	TBH it seems that any collection of Americans results in rape of some kind whether it's an interview for a movie part, college parties, prisons or homeless shelters.

t1_dsye483	0.750600	*	I think they were competing with CSI to see how much shit they could get past the producers rather than the audience, but your point stands. The people involved at least realized it was absurd.
t1_dt9znoo	0.493900	*	None of what I stated was opinion. Funny thing about liberals is when they try paint people as something its usually them thats guilty of it.
t1_dsj86ub	0.661900	*	Can you expand on this? My understanding is that the electoral college has never altered the outcome of an election.

t1_dtabb9j	0.726300	*	Well you know, in Germany your freedom goes as far as it doesn't impede on another person's freedom, so insulting people is not allowed. It's easy to understand and makes quite a lot of sense
t1_dt61i4n	-0.901900	*	I've given up on every older person that thinks this way, there's no point in wasting my time. We don't have to beat them, they have to beat us. All we have to do is let the clock run out on them.
t1_dta9ut9	0.613600	*	>I don't like them so they're not true.  Not exactly a valid argument.
t1_dsutt15	-0.273200	*	The 30% of the USA that are his hardcore supporters don't care what he does, so why appease them?  He is alienating 70% of America. That's stupid politics.

t1_dtb1ohx	0.000000	*	Pshh, you mean Russian ninja woosies. After, all, I am trained in the ancient art of interpretive dance, and will vanquish these Russian baby men, or, ninjas as you call them.

t1_dsdolvc	0.248400	*	Well, pooling money is a way to help poorer people gain influence. A rich person can spend more than a poorer person. However, by combining resources they may be able to spend more. 
t1_dt9xv77	0.421500	*	PopTarts are indeed hopless, unless you get the beer flavoured ones.
t1_dt9syu2	0.790600	*	I think you're heavily underestimating how many people are willing to go out and punch Nazis.

t1_dslfybp	0.495100	*	I don't think most American's are remorseful for the shitty parts of history of this nation. Stop holding other countries to higher standards.
t1_dthce3d	0.993300	*	> too bad you cant drive and dont have access to a car  I don't use airplanes. But still I use them because much of what I buy is transported by airplanes.

t1_dslbcj7	0.718400	*	> Yep, sounds aweful.  I never said it was awful. You're deflecting from the facts of the matter, which are that the U.S. has a lower standard of living than many other countries. It's a simple fact.
t1_dsst2xc	0.549900	*	In that case you are clearly uninformed, do some research and come back to this question
t1_dt93f6m	0.659000	*	Because they aren't pertinent to what we are talking about.

t1_dsm1d7h	0.762200	*	Culture in many ways does influence society, yes. But what about hatian culture is responsible for corruption? Why is hatian culture somehow not worth having in the US? Is it because they're poor? 
t1_dtwzvrt	0.557400	*	That last part is hugely important. Pretty much *every* disease that's more detectable than it used to bewhich is to say, pretty much every diseaseis subject to that problem.

t1_dsl1tj6	0.000000	*	A phrase? You said something which was easily proven to be a lie - not unlike a certain president!   Grow up and own your mistakes.

t1_dt1tu24	-0.356700	*	Nah I'm pretty satisfied.
t1_dtoq02r	-0.924900	*	depends on your personal view. Zoroastrianism also has some bad parts such as rampant incest.

t1_dtjc709	0.000000	*	I want your peer reviewed sources if you are going to claim something like that.  Removing the clitoral hood is very similar to removing the foreskin as it makes a highly sensitive area desensitized.
t1_dt1ftty	-0.786700	*	Make them suffer for supporting certain politicians.    Truly a failure of democracy and a mark of shame on the former administration. 
t1_dt74hrc	0.025800	*	No because they make the least. If you need social benefits to support yourself then you clearly are in no position to give back.

t1_dtpv45s	-0.421500	*	Yes quite, canned food is pasteurized inside the sealed can in 99%+ cases.   You're talking about foods that are not sold in cans. Like milk.  Apples in a conversation about oranges

t1_dtkaegi	-0.532100	*	Thanks for the clarification, but ethnicity does not change, right? My 10th cousin would probably still be the same race as me if they lived and married from the community. 
t1_dtd1fi6	0.571900	*	The liver from the last half cow I bought was about 10-12 lbs, kidneys were about 8 lbs. The meat yield was 750 lbs. We use every part of the animal(tallow, bones, all internal organs, etc).

t1_dt31gy1	0.812600	*	That's a good point. I think acting (in any capacity, including as a GM) is probably the only time it's not plain making fun of the accent. I just can't think of any other reasons.

t1_dsixlyc	0.000000	*	I really think the whole thing was blown out of proportion and so many things skewed and twisted. People still quote Tina fey thinking they are quoting Palin.
t1_dsna8xj	0.000000	*	And a lot of that is because it's all become politicized. An unfortunate pile of the right seems to think women being allowed to say no under any circumstances is somehow offensive.

t1_dtn2on2	-0.051600	*	Again as I mentioned the dossier was originated by Republicans. Democrats picked it up when Trump won the primary.
t1_dsjzup3	0.924900	*	Well the White House secretary said It's both sad and telling The New York Times would print the lies of their anonymous sources' anyway. so I would see that as denying it.
t1_dtrjch1	-0.990100	*	What, the system where you don't get rewarded for deciding you don't wish to be part of the workforce?  More are dead because of the communism that you propose

t1_dt0kajn	-0.241100	*	But if Europe stopped buying from Saudi - they would instead, have to buy from the same places the US buys from - so the price would go up - quite a lot!

t1_dtp1u2u	-0.402100	*	There's a difference between them letting you do it, like trump explicitly says, and you raping them like Harvey did.   Of course you can't distinguish between SAYING one thing and DOING one thing.
t1_dspdpev	-0.340000	*	That was over 60 years ago. How is it relevant today? 
t1_dskedrx	0.636900	*	I don't doubt that the data is correct for the countries it lists. But it does only list 35 of them, which does not cover all countries.

t1_dsq3bn8	0.101000	*	You're still not providing sources. These are not scientific sources, this is just you making claims that you make no effort to back up.

t1_dsuxmxa	-0.296000	*	Im sure you know several trump supporters being a the_donald troll.
t1_dtu8rry	-0.902200	*	Why not set up resources for women to report abuse rather than assume anyone dressed in a way you dont like must be a victim of oppression? Seems pretty bigoted.

t1_dsms5rs	0.000000	*	> Between 12 and 24 hours, which is a lot faster than the legacy banking system.  Maybe it's different in the US, but every bank I've used has made transfers basically instant.

t1_dtl4eav	0.772100	*	The point is if citizens didnt have guns, the police wouldnt need them either. They could survive with tasers and other non-Lethal weapons.
t1_dtcuecl	0.000000	*	So, we're supposed to give praise that 45 stepped in and stopped his corrupt people from doing something wrong? Is this supposed to be noteworthy, and not run of the mill?

t1_dsmrntw	0.153100	*	You asked for (well, you suggested  incredulity) explanation why someone would consider 241 not much time.  In comparison to most of Europe, 241 is barely the tip of an iceberg.
t1_dtgddyf	-0.381800	*	You have a very limited scope of things.
t1_dtd3oah	-0.188000	*	What's the deal with the cheese? I think I've missed something. 
t1_dtbs6vf	0.000000	*	You can have an opinion on whatever you like, but if you want people to listen to it it's got to be a good one.

t1_dt9web0	0.000000	*	It doesn't really matter how you personally feel about the cops, they're allowed to do their jobs. 
t1_dslkrij	-0.983600	*	Sure, but it also makes you wonder why.  Something tells me it has more to do with money and less to do with putting bad people behind bars.
t1_dstp1t5	-0.179600	*	Exactly.  It's a small landmass and was busy rebuilding itself fantastically.  It should be expected that the food is more homogeneous than massive countries like China.
t1_dsyzu9o	-0.859400	*	Without laws and standards, bad doctors wouldnt survive because no one would go tho them. Simplyfing things ovbioulsy but u get the point. More laws and regs isnt always a good thing
t1_dtnfpdf	0.177900	*	Incompetence. Did you not read how many of the judges were not endorsed by the ABA due to sheer lack of ability and incompetence? 
t1_dtiwb9r	0.421500	*	Limited internet access though.

t1_dtoodsj	-0.375100	*	We would save lives by being racists? 
t1_dt9qckc	0.273200	*	The cab is not the issue here. Also, did you forget which alt you were logged in to?
t1_dtczvfx	-0.469600	*	We should charge oil execs with crimes against humanity for poisoning the planet, then we should eat them.  
t1_dsrt0dv	-0.016400	*	Again you have diddly fucking squat of a basis for your most claim.

t1_dsycvwj	-0.690000	*	You forget about Halle Berry sunbathing?
t1_dt57s70	-0.453600	*	Damn I didn't realize that. I guess I assumed smoking on a balcony was okay because the idea that it isn't is just so fucking stupid and outlandish I never even considered it a possibility. 
t1_dsq4l48	0.000000	*	It helps that Gregory Peck absolutely kills it.
t1_dsh0cqh	0.318200	*	see edit

t1_dswlzbu	0.624900	*	Well, if you have to delve that far, saying Oh, they aren't trying to make it illegal, they are just trying to force everyone to their opinion, you may have a problem with comprehension in general.
t1_dsk93jp	0.000000	*	So true, btw didn't London only have 5-7 gun deaths last year? Hell it might have been the whole country.
t1_dsyc5ux	0.318200	*	I was beaten by an Albanian border guard for not bribing him. Mind you this is 1981. I have been beaten by many thugs but his moustache was magnificent. 
t1_dt320cx	0.361200	*	Yeah I didn't even read Before Watchmen or Doomsday Clock. Watchmen will forever be a standalone story in my head-canon.
t1_dtkwodf	0.754400	*	IIRC, yes. The info still resides in the genes of the microbe. It just isn't expressed.   Total layman on this topic for the record... but I think I'm correct here.
t1_dt79h05	0.493900	*	You know they wish every day their forefathers had just made it south at this point. They know about the outside world now. They know NK sucks dick. 
t1_dtx8cdx	0.636100	*	I always wondered what they would do if you just rocked up, but in their ads they do say you cannot vote if you aren't enrolled...

t1_dtjsuu1	0.419900	*	go on
t1_dsvehsp	-0.933600	*	I thought they were a pretty strong military power overall, but lacked force projection. Could they not clean up against Eastern Europe pretty easily since its just a direct land route. 
t1_dt8wnvo	-0.037000	*	That I don't care what a man thousands of miles away that doesn't affect me? No not really. It's not nazi germany over there

t1_dsmxut0	0.000000	*	There is more public knowledge out there than you would think. You can get the exact coordinates of all U.S. land-based nuclear missile silos on Wikipedia.
t1_dt6i7iw	0.373600	*	> I can't tell if the commentators here are RW Brigaders, are being sarcastic, or are all this uninformed.  I didn't put words in his mouth. He just said it. Brigaders = russian troll bots.

t1_dtm16su	-0.831600	*	A 7km/s railgun projectile can cover 100 miles (~161 km) in 23 seconds. Unless the enemy ship is moving evasively, predicting where it's going to be in 23 seconds is child's play.
t1_dss0rry	0.440400	*	Shoot, 10C is tshirt and jeans.  It's about -5C here at the moment, I'm good in a hoodie.
t1_dt2rpiq	-0.190100	*	This always confused me, it's literally titled The Second Story of Creation with a completely different timeline and setup.
t1_dsm8j4w	-0.361200	*	I bet you're wrong.
t1_dsmv96r	0.000000	*	Huh? Both Australia and the UK, from what I can tell, use it similarly. Before sporting events and at official events and such. It's not that much different from Canada either.
t1_dsyzhi0	0.340000	*	No we dont have a free market in any sense of the word. Can you call around asking for prices on an x ray? No you cannot.
t1_dt9cggj	0.669600	*	Oh even Fox is too liberal now. 
t1_dttdllt	0.000000	*	And america is exactly like what we see on tv? Basing a country on what you see on tv seems... Idiotic at best The fact that you found the comment interesting is.... Well....
t1_dttdof3	0.000000	*	Are we the bad guys?
t1_dsphfb8	0.784100	*	He's more like a parasite unto the world, but the electoral college just relishes its parasitic nature...
t1_dtkz9b4	0.273200	*	I do. I'm in one of them. Nationalised healthcare doesn't mean that private companies stop trying to muscle their way in.

t1_dso9dpw	-0.250000	*	This is hilariously edifying of fascist ideology in general. 
t1_dttz9hz	0.487100	*	See a psychiatrist. Get some help.
t1_dswrhdl	-0.908900	*	I think there are scenarios where it can be morally justified. Can you justify abortion for a healthy baby where the mother isn't in danger?
t1_dsf768p	0.273200	*	Yes? Why not?
t1_dsfo5af	-0.883400	*	You forgot to include the term state-sanctioned doping program in there.
t1_dt6ox72	0.051600	*	That's also true. Insulting a place is not necessarily the same as insulting the people who live/lived in that place. 
t1_dso9742	-0.820500	*	Yeah, you turned the tables right on me! Master strategist that you are. That was totally not you deflecting right there, you're just a rational, calm being promoting the free exchange of ideas.

t1_dtm8z3i	-0.241500	*	The only advantage of Methadone is that is legal. It is just pharma money making scheme. 
t1_dtqf0gu	-0.153100	*	I mean, sharing is part of what *defines* a meme.
t1_dtoofva	-0.840200	*	Sure, they were comparable. Stalin's brutality towards his own people is probably even unique to the soviets.  Thread is just mostly aimed at the Wehrmacht.\^\^

t1_dt1h9if	-0.421500	*	They don't need ports. Just Chinese and Russian vessels to support them.

t1_dt5w6yo	0.000000	*	Wow I thought they just used some sort of soundbyte from Dawkins when I watched the first few seconds, but this is an actual snippet.  It is a good example honestly!
t1_dsy3b17	0.458800	*	I dont have demographics, but Id say there is a decent chance that most people who consider themselves hackers are actually teenagers who are looking for laughs or petty revenge.
t1_dtq5v24	0.250000	*	season 2 is easily the worst season of the show. (that's the dock workers season, right?)
t1_dsl4drf	0.000000	*	Sad. Have we not made any progress this last half century? 
t1_dshsbyx	0.488200	*	You're absolutely right, but the trend of that violence spilling over into murder is becoming less and less popular of as device for change.
t1_dtcrkka	0.898600	*	Have you tried it? How do you know it would be brutal? It's worth taking a month or a week and just trying it out, it's our planet after all! :)
t1_dsf20p9	0.000000	*	So you're claiming female graduates are just better than their male counterparts so they can chose to go to Google, while men take the leftover jobs?
t1_dshaoh4	0.308000	*	It might mean something if commercial real estate wasnt experiencing a massive fallout right now.   This is a shit strategy.

t1_dslgdy9	0.000000	*	I did indeed. A flower used to make the blue dye that Celt warriors painted on their face. You could have read it before commenting.
t1_dswv760	-0.877700	*	If you use the word believe, you already lost the argument.
t1_dsmbnnv	-0.339500	*	Why? As I seller i would not. Too easy to be robbed. 
t1_dt0ucyj	0.177900	*	Then why was Trump called a misogynist when he attacked Rosie O'Donnell and Megyn Kelly? You can't have it both ways.

t1_dto0pll	0.752700	*	B-but, at that specific moment, the one number got bigger than the other number. That makes it better. What is this stability you speak of?
t1_dtby8j0	0.000000	*	Adding fragmentation to a bomb isn't exactly a new or revolutionary concept that no one knows of. Does basic knowledge of military ordnance qualify you for the list these days...?
t1_dto81ur	0.718400	*	Yeah I also know that Steve Buschemi was a firefighter at 9/11, reddit never shuts up about it. You spend so much more than the rest of the world yet endlessly portray yourselves in a positive manner

t1_dt61i4n	-0.849200	*	I've given up on every older person that thinks this way, there's no point in wasting my time. We don't have to beat them, they have to beat us. All we have to do is let the clock run out on them.
t1_dsv1zza	-0.318200	*	Huge amount of people living in poverty, barely educated, in giant metropolitan areas and the huge amount of illegal aliens and victims from the drug war put that figure into perspective 
t1_dto35iq	0.636900	*	I'm not seeing any connection from what you just posted and the original argument. You've derailed buddy.  Also, swingers are awesome. Sex is fun. You should try it.
t1_dsjfmfw	-0.728800	*	And war was the means the military used to affirm that ideology through hegemony. And during war they did a lot more nasty things.

t1_dtg6jle	0.000000	*	The diet = political belief logic is something I've had quite enough of. I bet I have better cholesterol than all you fucks using the term soy-boy.
t1_dtl3orz	-0.077200	*	How can you know that? The Russian doping lab was a fraud, all Russian tests that went through there are suspicious at best, and down right useless at worst.
t1_dttyqm4	-0.918800	*	I think this could be a Canadian thing - don't they (you?) - have issues with the First Nations as far as previous acts of violence? I.e. the spending is a political decision.
t1_dsfwdhq	-0.872000	*	So they better kill all the Palestinian huh?
t1_dswoedn	0.794700	*	Nah, all languages have weird bullshit. I'll probably get it wrong but German has 'ich Fresse einen wessen' which means I'll eat a broom.

t1_dt6jmnn	0.000000	*	You're still proving his point though, they're volatile. Good to suddenly awful back to suddenly good. No true long term stability.

t1_dsuv9u3	0.648600	*	Merely a joke. 
t1_dtqdio3	0.373600	*	Banning firearms entirely is pretty simple tbh, there's no good reason to own them.
t1_dt4p4mu	0.458800	*	Oh and, that wiki page has some other false information in it, there is no Palestinian State yet, because well, according to you, the whole world needs to recognize it, and it hadn't.

t1_dtdda1e	-0.921000	*	I'm saying China doesn't have freedom of speech.  What set the stage for modern China was the abandonment of Maoist policies and embracing western capital and foreign investment.
t1_dtm41s5	0.226300	*	The united states could never enforce it's will on major NUCLEAR powers. It could influence but it did not have direct authority. 
t1_dtosoui	-0.476700	*	I dont feel its a fact. Whites get killed by cops at a higher rate. I suggest your gullable ass stay of blackpeopletwitter.
t1_dspgems	-0.401900	*	Yeah, combined with weapons that have a ~10m accuracy and 10 100kt weapons will do way more damage than 1 1mt.

t1_dtj7vwk	0.670500	*	Forget flowers, why not open your own home to the homeless? Seems like a very tangible way be being the change you want to see in the world.
t1_dtibx4v	0.000000	*	30% more is a little?  Man your life must be sweet if you can afford a 30% increase to the cost of everything you do.
t1_dss7nu8	0.000000	*	I'm sorry, but you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. The USSR **was** a super power, but Russia is not. The US is considered to be the sole superpower on the planet today.
t1_dsmj478	-0.058000	*	I mean, you have a point, but the Wall Street Journal *usually* doesn't report things that are truly unsubstantiated when it comes to Trump.
t1_dsho7oa	-0.223000	*	I'm saying that he COULD do those things and people still wouldn't give him credit for it. I didn't think it was too complicated to be honest.
t1_dsvsm7n	0.000000	*	I hate to break it to you, but they were poor long before the socialist revolution. They got poor because the ruling class took everything.
t1_dt2qi2k	0.000000	*	You do know that America is two continents, not a country, right?
t1_dssin82	-0.973300	*	But most hoaxes dont get reported at all. Just some stupid kid wanting attention and everyone gets it and gives them a little, etc.
t1_dtr0zub	0.690800	*	The fact that comparisons can even be drawn between the two speaks volumes

t1_dt5rfk5	0.493900	*	Its spicy sauerkraut, right?
t1_dtojeip	-0.816800	*	The Soviet Union operated labour camps and undertook forced resettlements throughout the war.
t1_dsussmh	0.000000	*	Right, this is another important distinction to make. Trump is not cutting out a program that was providing a path to citizenship, just one that provided visas to work.
t1_dt5pgm6	0.000000	*	Maybe he's agreeing with you 
t1_dseaydo	-0.541300	*	So it's acceptable for the government to put it's own citizens into the crossfire down the road? I wonder if Japan regrets not doing anything in the past because now their country can easily be hit.
t1_dt79jx7	0.361200	*	I haven't heard of any Russian bot campaign for the release of evidence, only for Nunes' writing.

t1_dsrofau	0.796400	*	There's only one Korea to Koreans
t1_dtd5tot	0.000000	*	Of course it will get worse and soon but my personal choice won't affect anything. /r/vegan have achieved precisely nothing, their numbers are so insignificant that they might as well not exist.

t1_dsv8y1e	-0.224700	*	It takes anyone with common sense to see that.  Obama was gaping pussy apologist
t1_dsdgfbe	0.401900	*	How does this work? How do you control 8 characters simultaneous?
t1_dt4jckh	-0.383900	*	This would mean that all refugees in Europe from syria/iraq/Afghanistan are economic refugees.

t1_dtjjpg2	0.000000	*	If you think that's bad, there were about 80,000 Americans (inmates and the mentally disabled) forcibly sterilized by the government in the 20th century, some as late as the 1980s.
t1_dsnrvwz	0.000000	*	I hate Islam, not Muslims. #MAGA

t1_dsvaqd0	0.000000	*	I imagine your risk goes up if you jog in their home
t1_dtgt6gi	0.440400	*	I know we have different opinions but saying he deserved death for a hobby you don't agree with is delusional. Sure it is wrong, unethical, and plain stupid, but those hunts fund conservation. 
t1_dtr33nl	0.077200	*	Ok. Show me.
t1_dsfje6m	-0.632600	*	I don't work for the non profit that wrote this up. Read their summary page on their website.

t1_dsrzufy	0.421500	*	Well luckily Hillary outspent Trump like 3:1 and still lost so think you still got a shot.
t1_dt97ark	0.979600	*	Its just another thing on the mountain of stupid things Trump has done that aren't actually criminal. I'm so past being mad about it by now. 
t1_dspk0ap	-0.700300	*	Why, because freedom of expression shouldn't apply to stupid people?
t1_dtsq8e2	0.000000	*	The term 'nazi' has changed a bit in modern use of the word. If one supports hitler and/or his ideas, I think it is acceptable to call the person a nazi.
t1_dtgknan	-0.521600	*	Yes, it's a shame the citizenry of the US neither set up the system nor have the power to change it.
t1_dt6x30v	0.129800	*	Wait, -22%? Is the Italian government *paying* corporations? That IS insane

t1_dsldy6p	0.000000	*	Here's my spin: you guys would support that perfectly reasonable quote if it came from a white conservative.   You're only against it because it came from a brown left wing muslim.
t1_dslaauz	-0.051600	*	Now that you mention it, I think we're both right.  Quick search of a [cryobi video](https://youtu.be/-b7ORqBtHVM?t=40) pulled up Homeless Despot.
t1_dt7f4bk	0.968400	*	He assassinated his uncle with nerve gas...
t1_dt71h5o	0.571900	*	Lol. Wait until they cut Medicare and social security, robbing you of the money you have already paid into it. Then we will see about that victory...
t1_dthfcln	0.491200	*	> So one is 'poor' by virtue of being unable to pay seven figures for a shitty duplex. Huh. TIL.  No.
t1_dtrossd	0.440400	*	its a joke man. and more like Canadian English vs British English, which people do joke all the time are not mutually intelligible, because we have a sense of humour and you guys don't 
t1_dsyz43l	-0.361200	*	Which then either pays off the debt, liquifies assets to pay the debt, or runs out of money. In the final scenario, the debt doesn't magically transfer to your kin.

t1_dsnf5si	0.848700	*	If I recall correctly, Bush was only told that someone flew a plane into the WTC. I do not believe he quite understood exactly the scale of catastrophe it truly was.
t1_dtvvfir	0.000000	*	I knew lots of bankers that were really into coke.
t1_dszmnys	0.179500	*	Poorly structured if they can't pay living wages. If your company is so shite that it can't pay its people right, it deserves death, and fast.
t1_dtd7sow	0.318200	*	No its not.
t1_dsrjwyp	0.771700	*	He is gaining followers fast I hope this trend continous so he can influence as many Muslims as possible
t1_dt6mbr9	0.585900	*	So?
t1_dtszgco	0.000000	*	Then your point makes no sense as how much clothing costs or what brand they are have nothing to do with modesty.
t1_dtkwkei	0.000000	*	It's a matter of being able to regulate human behavior on a global scale.  ...that's almost impossible.
t1_dt4zyij	0.764500	*	Yeah the rural areas are pretty bad, but a lot of the cities are good enough to bring it out of shit-hole tier. For me a shit-hole is a place where even the major cities are awful to be in.
t1_dslvxql	0.000000	*	quick maths
t1_dssb6b4	0.190900	*	Donna Brazile is trying to sell copies of her book and thinks the Russians killed Seth Rich.   Shes not credible.   Anyway, this is entirely beside the point. Sanders lost. Full stop. 
t1_dtj8inc	-0.275500	*	Question, do you actually know anyone who is mad at their parents for getting them circumcised?
t1_dtijun2	-0.585900	*	But then we'd have to deprivatize prisons and actually spend money on them instead of someone making money off prisoners. 
t1_dtt7i2v	-0.848100	*	They have a habit of this sort of thing.
t1_dslx2oq	-0.451500	*	Not a fan of jalapenos, but I've sprinkled tabasco sauce on my slices and I enjoy it like that.
t1_dsu0ueo	0.000000	*	Yeah, up here in Michigan, you just go to a hill to practice. Also, damn never seen an Ann Arborite on Reddit before.
t1_dsmghwg	0.624000	*	Im  not sure what that has to do with my point. Trump was incorrect to wonder why we need people from the shithole continent. 
t1_dtvmkdw	-0.381800	*	I never understood why circumcision studies were done in Africa and then people try to apply those results to the USA 
t1_dsxv908	0.598400	*	Youre welcome! It is pretty fascinating. So fascinating I decided to study it at university!
t1_dsn1xqk	-0.762900	*	Why would the birds die? What about fish or people?

t1_dtmwq8v	-0.594000	*	Ah but in that scenario you're seeing that alongside a bunch of different viewpoints. What if you were stuck in somewhere like the donald for a month, where views like that were all you saw and heard.
t1_dtd26pm	0.000000	*	It's almost like if you shove 50 homeless people with no screening for mental illness or temperament or drugs into a building meant for 20 that you may have a bit of an unsafe environment.  
t1_dt7osmb	0.826800	*	Dijon is usually much more spicy than that artificially-looking yellow,  sweet stuff you Americans call mustard. 
t1_dt7au9u	0.590400	*	Day to day speech.... Hmmm 
t1_dtjdvkh	-0.584900	*	As far as I know it is legal for parents to spank their kids, so yeah... do it.

t1_dtk8w7a	0.440400	*	Many of which we just dont know.  Were a loooong way away from being able to accurately and functionally recreate a human being down to the molecule with a computer model.  
t1_dtx0p1w	0.000000	*	I thought the postal vote on marriage equality showed that the electorate can do a 'bang-up job' as you call it.
t1_dtdu684	0.000000	*	Well that was a good explanation that showed a thorough and nuanced understanding of the situation.

t1_dsmxut0	0.000000	*	There is more public knowledge out there than you would think. You can get the exact coordinates of all U.S. land-based nuclear missile silos on Wikipedia.
t1_dswlray	0.665200	*	Not kissing a religions ass is not the same as persecution.
t1_dtq1yaa	-0.128000	*	No one should be smoking under that age anyway.  Wait until you graduate high school. Problem solved.
t1_dtnxlz4	0.566100	*	What about Syria and Lebanon and Jordan? They partitioned that with the French too and pissed off arabs living in the area as well

t1_dsydhby	-0.822500	*	Oh yes. Like the same trial that israel gave before it killed the Palestinians he collaborated against you mean?
t1_dtkvfty	0.000000	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...
t1_dtrhra0	0.421500	*	Not just the ten of them, but the ten of them that post the same damn meme that they posted days ago, but you are just getting now.

t1_dsllhl3	-0.496900	*	They aren't all thrown out.  I provided sources. You provided opinions and random exaggeration.   Anyways.. not my country.. not my problem. Deal with it or not. It's upto you.
t1_dsn1b7b	0.273200	*	Can confirm, not owned by Murdoch. I think you're right in that they sensationalize their headlines, but they're most definitely not the worst offender for that in the UK. 
t1_dtss71r	0.000000	*	But how is that third world tier? Most of us can afford to cough up $100-150 every once in a while when we need to see a doc.

t1_dt00bdk	0.510600	*	Think, Watson. What can be deduced of the evidence and where is my cocaine? 
t1_dshcqdz	0.000000	*	Again, show me the IRC rule that taxes an individual for an inheritance. That money is taxed at the estate level, which as you said, cannot be taxed by the IRS.
t1_dta4fw5	0.443500	*	I have never heard of anyone getting sued over flipping the bird or insults in the USA. Just driving in New Jersey would make you a millionaire.

t1_dsnwfbd	0.000000	*	So, ~1 per year in a frame of 700years? Dude, at least use relevant stats. Alone the fact of different education and lifestyle / more presence in nature hundreds of years ago....

t1_dtp4jek	0.000000	*	Only source was the Fire and Fury book. I'm not a Trump supporter but I wouldn't trust a book that can't hire an editor to correct simple spelling mistakes let alone confirm sources.
t1_dtd5ysu	0.000000	*	Not even close to saying that, but thanks for trying.
t1_dt1aws9	-0.153100	*	I disagree. An uneducated populace is easy to sway toward not voting in their best interest, which destroys the beholden to the people benefit. See: Donald *fucking* Trump.
t1_dt73jzx	0.051600	*	43/50 states have income tax, and everyone has to pay FICA tax which is 7.65%.
t1_dt9ne6x	0.000000	*	What point are you even trying to make? You have like 15 posts in this thread and it's all inane garbage.

t1_dsgpz16	0.000000	*	People keep saying that, but it's not the core of it. Religion alone doesn't drive people to commit horrible crimes. There's more to it than that.
t1_dts3gnq	-0.687200	*	If it makes you that mad, maybe you need to spend some time with yourself and figure out what your problems really are. Good luck!

t1_dtovmof	-0.872400	*	53% of us native italians aren't employed. Since they aren't a resource, should we send them out of the country? Should we also send overseas the disabled and unable because of their uselessness ?

t1_dtitm3v	-0.168000	*	A tumor is an anomaly that should be removed. A foreskin is what **100% normal** humans are born with and not cause for concern... what else you got ?
t1_dsiv3tr	0.000000	*	I remember one of the pieces of info that came around that time was that the technology exists to read information from the computer just by listening to it run. Nothing is secret on a cumputer.

t1_dtiq4ws	-0.354900	*	Speak for yourself, I'm here to support the devices. What is and isn't moral is subjective. There exists no one who isn't aware there is homeless people.

t1_dsr1m4y	0.000000	*	The only way around the trickle is the societal equivalent of ripping our dicks out and not living luxuriously. Or we just invent some shit and get on with your day. 
t1_dtn03ts	-0.151100	*	How do you know if it's not the other way around?   What if the other reason is why they attempted to get the warrant and the warrant is based around that issue? The dossier is just the cherry on top?

t1_dsm4ncp	-0.525600	*	Paris is a shitshow. London is also fucked.
t1_dteuit8	0.153100	*	Isn't that the key to selling anything though? Pretend you're just as excited about stuff the customer likes as they are, and act like you're their best friend.
t1_dsvato9	-0.893000	*	Then what the fuck is the point of gun control? What the fuck is the point of the war on drugs? 
t1_dswojn4	0.743000	*	It can very easily be transformed into law and I'd actually say that right now the facts are ambiguous enough to be able to support either side 
t1_dsx67k3	-0.949300	*	Sure but if suddenly everyone is foraging and hunting for everything vaguely edible there may not be a lot left.

t1_dtkx4u3	0.189100	*	I don't see how they're doing a bad job if they're telling the truth. They might be doing a bad job and not covering *all* the arguments though, that's about it.

t1_dtisktb	0.000000	*	It shows that you're dishonest, since you believe intent to imprison someone who opposes you politically isn't literally 'one step removed' from carrying it out.
t1_dt959tr	0.273200	*	You mean that time they threw British tea that wasn't owned by Americans into an American harbor, thereby sending their message without destroying their own shit? Yeah, I remember that.

t1_dshaoh4	-0.341200	*	It might mean something if commercial real estate wasnt experiencing a massive fallout right now.   This is a shit strategy.

t1_dsxo9e5	-0.128000	*	Why is the mass decreasing? I thought the size change was because the sun ran out of hydrogen to fuse, and began to fuse heavier elements. Which fucks with the equilibrium.

t1_dsznq38	0.273200	*	It's a very useful word
t1_dsiqg86	-0.752200	*	This thread has been radically derailed. How did we get from protecting the border from a geographical area with more deaths than an active war zone to fuck Disney for using H1Bs?

t1_dszkxd1	0.677100	*	Agreed, until minimum wage goes up again next year, and continues to adjust for inflation. Until we see basic income guarantee we'll probably never stop fighting corporations like Tim Hortons.
t1_dt7gl2f	0.611400	*	Maybe more men are interested in the industry then women. Maybe theres just more qualified men than women.
t1_dttxooe	-0.443800	*	because if all the current species die how will new ones repopulate? animals don't just spontaneously spring in to being. this sort of apathy is so useless.

t1_dt96yyw	0.822500	*	Does it have to be in the article? They are literally giving women more time for exams.
t1_dtreglr	0.000000	*	You're coming across as a bit of a dick. 
t1_dtg6dhe	0.154800	*	That's because it dilutes the states power. That being said a state is free to apportion their electoral vote however they see fit. You can effect this by voting in state elections. 
t1_dsrecen	0.000000	*	Texans are saying the same thing. It was fucking 65 yesterday, and it's not going to break freezing today. Everything is ice.

t1_dtcwrtr	0.542300	*	True, but it's also worth noting that the Republican Party of Rutherford B. Hayes and Benjamin Harrison bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of today.
t1_dtx2l6w	0.000000	*	This will lessen the massive potential selective advantage for an effective pathogen ... how?  Serious question, we're straying from my area but I'm curious.  
t1_dtdnd6o	0.765700	*	To be fair, one is a generalization about a current set of people who have a set of traits.  The other one is saying that humans governing themselves is always about corruption. 
t1_dta0lja	-0.962900	*	Please explain.
t1_dsfyr8c	0.000000	*	saving the environment is not about saving money... money is worthless if we are dead...  but of course if you can do it while spending less money, that would be great

t1_dtp3rry	-0.476700	*	LOL this is always my favorite. Too many words, egghead! Because knowing things and articulating ideas is for liberal elite pussies, amirite?
t1_dt5jmp0	0.077200	*	Cut out the superfluous words and leave your proposed noun in and see if the sentence makes sense.  'There is a number to spell definitely.'  'There are ways to spell definitely.'

t1_dt1b93e	-0.884500	*	Do some research on how many of his businesses failed and how many times he went bankrupt. I'm not even going to give you the answer because you probably won't believe me. Just do some research.
t1_dsnqzcz	0.834500	*	Just waiting for anyone to answer my original nonbiased question. Quite simple. 
t1_dtigp95	-0.851900	*	Yes, but how many people who saw that ad knew that? The vast majority probably just heard a muslim-sounding name which is exactly what was intended.

t1_dslvs3s	0.743000	*	I'm not even upset lol. What I don't understand is why people ARE upset. A lot of the countries these leeches come from are shitholes. That's why they leave in the first place
t1_dtfrwwz	0.872000	*	I am honestly lost how you get from 0% interest rate to needing no money to loan...
t1_dsk8rtw	-0.743000	*	I do too. But when I get home I'm happy that I helped society. I don't despise all the non-white poor people I just helped out.
t1_dsx8w66	-0.259300	*	Because you own an equel share of what your company produces, that's not stealing, companies paying people 1/10 of the wealth they produce for them is much closet to stealing.
t1_dtnynk1	-0.389200	*	Either you are trolling or you didn't understand a single thing that I just said. Try reading it all again and come back to me when you actually understood it.
t1_dtbpbfj	0.000000	*	I didnt even have to apply, one day a bird just dropped the closing docs for my dream house on my kitchen table, next to 4 racks for moving expenses/anything new I might need. 0% for 200 years.

t1_dt4qbyq	-0.340000	*	Which is my point. You can be a Republican, and not be backwards, just as you can be a Democrat, and not be an annoying SJW.
t1_dt6ayu2	0.000000	*	That is literally the opposite of what I said and Democrats in congress said.  Have you ever considered that maybe something is wrong with your position if you have to lie about  everything?
t1_dt2klpj	0.000000	*	There's a whole subreddit dedicated to him saying shit in the past and now it's happening again for him. I'd give it an A grade for a subreddit. /r/TrumpCriticizesTrump

t1_dsqbwr1	-0.296000	*	Did your robot have a countdown timer, and start beeping loudly in the middle of class for him to pull out and open up?  
t1_dswo9ox	0.421500	*	Wow a redditor actually admitted they may be overreacting. I don't know if you are or not but I feel like this may be a first time for this website
t1_dsgvfp2	0.542300	*	 Yeah, that's why I clarified certain segment. Not  every Republican is on board with what happening in the party.

t1_dta0s1v	0.153100	*	She seems like the kind that will tell you she is, but in reality is only up to the point it even slightly inconveniences her.   I didn't know that though. That's super fucked up.
t1_dsobhzm	0.318200	*	I have a very firm grasp of it. It's actually one of the fundamental concepts used in Russian propaganda.  
t1_dsm61w8	-0.659700	*	OK, but then you're a hypocrite. The only reason you are able to have this conversation with me is because you and I are different to other animals.
t1_dt9hvqf	0.874300	*	Ive never reaped the benefits of anything youre talking about. Please tell me how I personally have perpetuated these alleged advantages.

t1_dtxtom5	0.920100	*	> You can in fact eat things that aren't on the menu at McDonalds.  What a surprise, a conservative that only argues in strawmen.
t1_dtqf8mm	0.476700	*	I think asking for some examples of minority party politicians calling for a foreign country insulting the President to respect the highest office of the US government is pretty reasonable.
t1_dtlb9c5	-0.407600	*	Maybe produced, but designed?
t1_dtvecnr	-0.827900	*	Ukraine is an example of a non-NATO state being directly interfered with by Russia in a way they have never done with a NATO state. It proves that Russia is still a threat to isolated countries. 
t1_dsfzt2v	0.000000	*	im just saying that comparing a larger nation to a small one and saying The big one is worse in percentage is pointless because the size difference.

t1_dtdncuo	0.296000	*	So what?
t1_dt5uuef	0.177900	*	Exactly my point.   Anything that confirms this bias is going to be treated as truth, anything which goes counter to this bias is going to be viewed as propaganda likely spread by Russian bots. 
t1_dsmf8w1	-0.440400	*	Ur a murderer
t1_dtt3emp	0.539900	*	No claim of truth or falsehood was made, merely a comparison of two sides displaying the same unhelpful behavior.

t1_dtv7gkw	0.458800	*	I'd rather someone back out of a deal when it's too late than stay in the deal then not follow through. Sure, I'll be pissed either way, but I know which one I would prefer.
t1_dtbn7ii	-0.258400	*	You're commenting in a small thread on Brexit mate. If you count that as stalking you've lived a hell of a sheltered life.
t1_dt9euaq	-0.897900	*	He would literally turn this country into a Theocracy with a Republican controlled Congress. It'd be Christian Sharia.   Trump is a moron, Pence is outright dangerous. 
t1_dtiq1xq	0.757900	*	You know what does curve off after 50 meters though? A 4.2/4.5kg rocket. The tracer is designed such that it will (mostly) follow the trajectory the rocket would.   For ranging.
t1_dteeh7e	0.025800	*	So, racism is indoctrinated into American society, then.  Comparing now to 50 years ago does not equate to racism not being indoctrinated into American society.
t1_dtoews6	-0.202300	*	Disenfranchisement is an issue.  The Battle Flag is not disenfranchisement.
t1_dshzvs6	0.844200	*	Where in Africa? What kind of influence do you see?
t1_dsto5fz	0.685500	*	Think of it like investing in a new (software) technology that might catch on. Or supporting the developers of that project.
t1_dsvuucw	0.000000	*	You know national socialism is far left, right?
t1_dt8w5jw	0.000000	*	That just means the problem is throughout the entire education system and not suddenly appearing at the college level.
t1_dtg5wxd	0.012900	*	And look at how well No Establishment Bullshit is going...
t1_dsko366	0.000000	*	After WWI and WWII, absolutely. One of the main causes of WWII was endemic poverty caused by crippling war reparations after WWI.
t1_dstfqim	-0.872300	*	Well, regardless of source, finding ANY source in regards to things in NK is rather difficult, even worse to try and find someone to verify it.

t1_dtjjqol	0.000000	*	I don't know how that makes any sense to an adult's mind but that's horrifying.
t1_dt2aei1	0.136300	*	Im stealing the Liberty bell whos with me?

t1_dt9s2c1	0.000000	*	My dude, I think Axle was also joking, as in it's ironic to have to download a phone app onto a phone.
t1_dtgglau	-0.726900	*	Youre completely missing my point.  My point is, if Yeltsin is what you get when you elect someone fairly, maybe its better to just have a dictator, because lets face it, Yeltsin ruined Russia. 
t1_dtdtpq9	0.000000	*	Agreed. What I don't understand at all still are the women and people of color who voted for Trump and stand behind him. 
t1_dsn0a48	0.361200	*	Technically if an F-22 can locate an ICBM is it entirely possible to shoot it down.  Highly fucking unlikely. 
t1_dsn0ah7	0.542300	*	Lol no. The most extreme/right wing version of capitalism goes to the Austrians like Murray Rothbard and Hans Hermann Hoppe. A centrally planned economy is literally the opposite of capitalism
t1_dsl7xsi	-0.980900	*	Demographics of Tibet. Still waiting despite the pathetic attempt to deflect.
t1_dsk3ea0	0.419900	*	Yeah, but he linked a source where they were comparable and then says consider deviations among the public.... That doesn't seem that crazy does it?

t1_dsj3icc	0.108200	*	For what? To show that a strong naval super power reduces piracy? Or that we currently live in an Era of relative peace? Any history book will show you that.
t1_dsqcwm0	0.000000	*	did anyone say that it was? bias is consuming you bruh
t1_dsup9v6	-0.361200	*	Good luck buddy, you can't expect Republicans to argue facts, or have facts to back up their arguments.
t1_dskyy1i	-0.102700	*	Why military spending? Why not think about trying to fix the disaster that is Social Security? 
t1_dsppwc7	-0.340000	*	Pal Kal was banned only after that happened. The engineer went to jail cause the judges had no clue about engineering and people died so someone had to go to jail.
t1_dshq9ry	-0.764400	*	And the blackjack!
t1_dtqdqb0	0.401900	*	True.  I need to get better at differentiating all these dictators

t1_dthkwb8	0.762000	*	So you gained support for Trump because he is playing a character that is fucking over the country? 
t1_dse87ce	-0.361200	*	I've already addressed his state,  the guy is nuts.      This is not addressing his state, this is a sensationalist headline 
t1_dttav5q	0.903400	*	You think Canada is communist? Or you don't know what Canada is a gigantic, underpopulated but mineral rich country which can afford an extremely light form of collectivism? Which is it?
t1_dsoppot	0.000000	*	Just don't be binary.  In the real world, people aren't so easily categorized.  That's a neoprogressive delusion.  
t1_dt9xshk	0.409800	*	Yes actually I was joking.
t1_dsiv3tr	0.000000	*	I remember one of the pieces of info that came around that time was that the technology exists to read information from the computer just by listening to it run. Nothing is secret on a cumputer. 
t1_dtmy053	0.316900	*	Thanks for admitting defeat. Have a nice day.  Oh... you won't though.  https://imgur.com/a/JbCxw#1dJpNzM

t1_dt8bkcg	-0.240600	*	>Well, American journalists aren't killed by the government  Lol, yes they are. James Dolan was just killed by the US government. 
t1_dtdcss7	-0.899200	*	If you don't know much about the country, why are you stating your opinion as fact?
t1_dtoaanw	-0.536200	*	I'm a bit skeptical of him willing to enforce NATO rules in the event of an attack on Canada. He won't even enforce laws passed by his own government. 
t1_dt5qo6v	-0.990000	*	Didn't he murder an American citizen, a doctor or something?
t1_dsl52i5	0.446800	*	But when it pays off its worth the risk 
t1_dtai0mq	0.458200	*	Against the law can only happen with power + prejudice. Women are marginalized in this patriarchal society and don't have the power to be against the law by definition. 
t1_dsukg4o	0.000000	*	Says the person who has never worked on a farm.  Most western people would not want to work on a farm even with a decent salary.

t1_dsmd9xm	0.250000	*	How did Me Too come up? it was not mentioned anywhere in story.  Also this happened and was reported in the 1980s.

t1_dt847gh	-0.401900	*	I don't hold the first position you mention but for that to be hypocrisy those two positions would actually have to be related to each other. They have nothing to do with each other
t1_dsx0725	0.421500	*	Dont be like that. You know thats not the issue at all. The issue really does just boil down to at what point do you believe a fetid is a child. 
t1_dsx2ni6	-0.380400	*	That's why we have the charter
t1_dt5cype	-0.296000	*	no, it's 14k lower.  but nice try.
t1_dticj64	0.000000	*	The refrigerator on AF1 costs $24M. A golf weekend at mar-a-lago costs $3.6M. No way that shuttering a military base costs only $2M.
t1_dtg9mpu	0.000000	*	Yeah bought first house on outskirts of Seattle at 24. Not that it's easy but still do-able. Definitely not as easy as the older generation leads on though.

t1_dtjz7xg	0.878600	*	Jeez, even tripadvisor agrees with you: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attractions-g39604-Activities-Louisville_Kentucky.html  Parks, historic sites, museums and caverns as the top things to do. :(
t1_dsvht4r	0.140600	*	You literally made that second number up. Great lies, best lies.   Edit: number is still wrong after edit
t1_dt3vtdr	0.000000	*	No luxury resources traded out of the country = more luxury resources for your own population maybe? 
t1_dsi0uqf	0.000000	*	Not everyone, but a lot of people. I think the success of Fox News, a non news network, is a testament to America's lack of critical thought.
t1_dtfmbh4	0.000000	*	Youre missing the point. His point is not about feminism.

t1_dslvdis	0.000000	*	Yeah but no one would ask you no but..where are you REALLY from if you say youre from Indiana. You know its different so stop pretending otherwise

t1_dtjlgro	0.000000	*	Interacting with you is like conversing with a retarded child.
t1_dttn4ao	0.726900	*	Fuck me, that's horrible.  I had days to carry over this year so I've got 31 days holiday to take this year. I think the legal minimum here in the UK is 20 days.  
t1_dt9101a	0.000000	*	I can see where you participate on reddit, you either voted for Trump or aren't old enough to vote

t1_dtrxbk6	0.216800	*	> The only reason that (overt and boldfaced) corruption doesn't run rampant in every level of government in America is that there are systems of checks and balances.  Should we tell him?

t1_dtpu5qg	0.897900	*	art used to be open source
t1_dt8kv0u	-0.463000	*	It is not misleading.  It was expected there would be an extension.  It was up to Trump to choose whether or not to extend it.  It is newsworthy regardless of which option he chose to take.

t1_dtv44tz	0.000000	*	They'd be mad either way since they were expecting the US to give out a lot of money. The difference is the US isn't breaking its word if it doesn't sign.

t1_dsebaxl	0.552500	*	But if they had kids here in that time, they'll only speak English most likely. So what do they do if they're a minor and their parents are getting deported? 
t1_dsv7zvl	0.000000	*	I'm sorry these mouth breathers beat you up so bad for making an observation fun your home. Why don't you tour middle America then you don't have to tell us about movies

t1_dt2pm5f	-0.770200	*	Just goes to show that no matter how far we go is never enough for some people.  You will never be happy.  So why bother even trying to please you?   
t1_dtky5vj	0.000000	*	Mature adults don't want to take it out on people. They want to work together with other mature adults to fix the problem.  This doesn't lend itself to hot takes. Sorry.

t1_dstfavu	-0.812600	*	So potentially this is something Bannon could verify (Comey was fired before Bannon was let go IIRC)?  That would give Muellers investigation some teeth I imagine. Or am I barking up the wrong tree?
t1_dskrkks	-0.247700	*	No it really is a lie.   You can block an entire country of people because Barack Obama enabled future presidents to do so.   You should probably read up on this.

t1_dsrny2j	0.000000	*	That saying 400,000 people have died in North Korean concentration camps is perhaps spurious at best, and doesnt tell us much.

t1_dslwm9h	0.077200	*	Multiple sources have *also* said that Trump *didnt* say it. At this point youre just believing what you want to believe.

t1_dtd0sus	0.709600	*	Everyone realizes that Obama can't be president again right? There's a term limit of 2 terms for any one person that's it. He can't take a brake for a couple of years and then go again. 
t1_dsdy5ix	0.000000	*	The money was involved in a crime so it (the money) gets sued in civil court. That's the theory anyway

t1_dtwqy2u	-0.917700	*	I don't think you're sufficiently taking into consideration the many preceding decades of context of this nation when you say what you're saying. As if they should somehow be grateful.

t1_dt21hj3	0.802000	*	Oh, then I guess we're both wrong. Me for thinking that wealth earned in 2017 is the same as income, and you for thinking that wealth earned in 2017 is the same as total wealth.
t1_dt1sudt	0.316700	*	Would they know who struck if this weapon hit, or does second strike just assume a target?
t1_dtouy97	-0.790600	*	I guess selling out your country to another foreign power is much better? Whose the bigger terrorist? Khadr or Russia? Hmm.. 
t1_dtcv8wy	-0.557400	*	Do you like Rick and Morty? 
t1_dsogxlw	-0.177900	*	If ever there was a clear-cut case of don't stick your dick in crazy, this is surely it.
t1_dto9ic8	0.717800	*	Those trade relationships are secured through our military. Its defense because the military defends our interests, not just the homeland.
t1_dsyoijd	0.000000	*	Just google it. Or keep living in denial. 
t1_dt36ydl	0.202300	*	Right, but cultural pride isnt idpol. Its i like the culture i come from that i was raised in, and id share it with someone if they asked me to

t1_dte9ogr	-0.557400	*	Yep, I'm the one doing harm by pointing out that russias problem extends further than russia. You just can't do that, you know? Nice projections btw.
t1_dsp9i3f	-0.294200	*	That's part of what I meant by efficiency, no point in targeting a city with 200,000 ppl with a 50mt weapon 
t1_dsxo2zk	0.440400	*	I'm being pedantic and not serious, the sun isn't pushing the earth into a larger orbit as it's mass decreases. 
t1_dt4lxho	-0.240600	*	Unless they're a robot I doubt they feel no emotion :) Anger is also an emotion.
t1_dteh08r	-0.802000	*	If you notice, you didnt actually address any of his points. This kind of lazy arguing will get you trump 2020. 
t1_dswyv31	0.000000	*	Clearly if there's a need for the position, then those employees cant handle more on top of their current workload. It would make the position redundant and they wouldnt have it in the first place
t1_dt2k91z	-0.625600	*	But millions can. Ironic that you profit directly from the companies you despise so much. 
t1_dt74nml	0.687200	*	I bet even if nk collapses without war, the people being suddenly told everything is a lie and the Kims are Hitler would lead to widespread rejection and mass riots.
t1_dsus6c9	0.000000	*	Immigrants arent making it harder for middle class people to have jobs.
t1_dsr0um4	0.226300	*	Part of the problem is, if there's no punishment then these kind of propaganda events will continue.
t1_dtmzjf2	0.000000	*	I said to check back in the morning since it was classified last night. [Now you can read it and weep.](https://imgur.com/a/JbCxw) Turns out Trump was right all along. 
t1_dsivb3h	0.526700	*	I hate to kill the joke, but the commonly accepted acronym for the US Department of Agriculture is 'USDA'.

t1_dsuleez	-0.599400	*	Israel is not the one causing conflict and no they are not building any bases on land that is not theirs.  again, it is time that all decent people in the world stop rewarding riots and terrorism.

t1_dswixxk	-0.917900	*	It could very easily be argued that they want to GIVE RIGHTS, the right to life to an unborn person. You are not seeing this from an unbiased position IMO.

t1_dsxhu25	0.000000	*	Is that the same as how the Romans didn't have a state when their empire encompassed hundreds of cities that weren't Rome?

t1_dsjwte4	0.908100	*	Freedom isn't always fun :(
t1_dtrtia2	-0.886000	*	That would be a great sci-fi comedy premise. We keep creating sentient machines, but they always kill themselves once they're exposed to social media.
t1_dsqirmu	-0.102700	*	Yep. And there are a lot of things that fall under public record. Having your address in a phone book for example is considered public record if somebody spreads it. 
t1_dt6iepw	0.401900	*	Was it a limited space though?
t1_du0utzt	0.789600	*	Can't remember if I said thanks for the direction or not. Exciting Friday night means I'll be starting on this soon. Cheers!

t1_dsjiyt6	0.318200	*	Hmmm, I don't remember that, honestly.  Let's just agree to disagree, and at least agree that our media is a whole lot better than in the US :p
t1_dske1qi	-0.051600	*	He is an absolute cunt. 
t1_dsjjlex	0.872200	*	You just did what Libertarians hate the most: getting called out on their bullshit.
t1_dsno7yu	0.000000	*	Spoken like a true psychopath. Which isn't surprising. Nothing gets conservatives angrier than protests.

t1_dsown02	-0.750600	*	Im saying they could probably get it there without us noticing. Im also not saying this would be their only avenue. But having another means to deliver a payload still ups the ante.

t1_dtomnyz	0.401900	*	Mark Blyth is an awesome speaker and has some pretty interesting ideas on austerity. Highly recommended for his youtube speeches and his books.

t1_dsr8ytx	0.000000	*	You do need a passport (or national id card) to travel within Schengen, though, because you need to be able to show id abroad. They just don't check your id at the border.

t1_dtx5q77	-0.778300	*	Rights can only be deprived by a court. So you'd have to commit a felony. No one complains about felons and misdemeanants not having gun rights and that's also enumerated.

t1_dta7pji	0.963600	*	No, I just treat women as the individuals they are, rather than objects to get sex from.  &nbsp;  ...works wonders.

t1_dsecc9v	0.318200	*	Why isn't anaesthesia used first before hanging or using the chemical injection?  That way there is no risk of the person feeling a thing.
t1_dsucs8c	0.000000	*	The ONLY reason its not sovereign is because Israel shoots dead any Palestinian who attempts to exercise sovereignty over their own territory. 
t1_dtorow1	0.705900	*	That's a really scum bag thing to say dude. Like seriously where do you come off?
t1_dt31hnk	0.000000	*	Holy American mental gymnastics.        I guess you are going to insist that US has no responsibility in Iraq or Libya being the way they are either, yeah?

t1_dtvinrt	0.670500	*	Carlsberg is Danish, but not a good (or bad) beer. We have many more that are better but you wouldnt know them. 
t1_dtri8au	0.000000	*	2/3 of my suggested videos are the same damn music videos all of the time. It's irritating. 
t1_dt384m2	0.000000	*	Not only is it bad, it is the slogan of horrible beer. Kill it with fire. 
t1_dt4l627	0.778300	*	I mean feel free to google all you want.. but sure we wont see the actual text messages until the democrats stop stone walling their release.
t1_dsure4i	-0.145100	*	Uh, did you read that?  He was found not guilty.  
t1_dtaysxc	0.510600	*	Pretty fuckin' dumb analogy too. The purpose is to facilitate commerce and not get robbed blind for half a billion dollars.
t1_dtabwr2	-0.296000	*	Not really? Youre saying that have to be ultra careful to not get shot or arrested because police are like crazed dogs, willing to kill or attack at the smallest slight.
t1_dst9nbf	-0.177900	*	Ive seen the whole thing uncensored. Do you think its CGI or some shit?  And even if it were fake I dont think it would be that crazy to believe it went they fuckin strap bombs to children.

t1_dsl1pz2	-0.970400	*	Well done, you can google a word. Now answer my original question and tell me how many school shooters were Muslim? How many mass shootings in the US were done by Muslims?   And Im not a liberal. 
t1_dttuvn2	0.000000	*	The surgery cost 14,000 up front. I didn't have 14,000 because I was fucking 16 years old. 
t1_dtsf0o6	-0.102700	*	I heard Arby's is hiring, you should check that out.
t1_dt2hggr	-0.951400	*	They dont, now you tell me how America justified it is okay to have school kids shot by assault rifles and daily mass shooting is okay. Did you forget the recent leaked cia document about torture? 
t1_dsp0zkp	0.526700	*	My GF is a goddess. Being with her reaffirms my belief in the divine. Downvote away, jealous haters! Hahahaha!
t1_dtg5pi7	0.000000	*	Huh. She went from Aeronautical Engineering to acting. That's fascinating.
t1_dswq0dr	0.421500	*	Dont forget that bizarre foray into barbaric cultural practices and appeals to old guard Canadians  Lost his mind that last year in office... 
t1_dshgfte	0.708800	*	yeah, that's why i said on all those issues in the next sentence 
t1_dtput9s	-0.700300	*	How is it irrelevant? The law applies to everyone it doesn't matter if they're been taught it or not. I guess that means i can go murder someone and then claim I didn't know murder was illegal, right?
t1_dth35mk	0.530500	*	Because you could do a million more lucrative and easier without having to sell billions of people
t1_dsmai86	0.422000	*	You did say he was a trade off though. So you conceded he was bad but he traded well. If you're now saying that you're not getting much out of him, then where's the trade off? 
t1_dto9s5c	0.401900	*	What's Brampton? A musical?

t1_dss6ii7	0.340000	*	Unfortunate for them? Seriously? They tried to scam their employers with a fake degree and a fake interview, they are as honest as those Nigeran princes with their billionaire legacy!
t1_dtalj55	-0.341200	*	Not in bavaria
t1_dsuver1	0.000000	*	Again, just curious, Y not Stein? She was personally my backup (context from Texas, my vote dont mean flip unless it's blood red XD)
t1_dtm11sz	0.000000	*	Don't know about mushrooms, but you can't exactly fit LSD into an afternoon. That requires basically booking a day for.
t1_dsk7ts8	0.250000	*	How is it forbidden if it's something the Prophet himself practiced? Something is clearly not adding up. 
t1_dtowk19	0.000000	*	So basically what you and the other commenter are saying- is that due to the fact one Nigerian killed a woman- all Nigerians or black people for that matter are responsible and should be shot at? 
t1_dtx7uu3	0.735900	*	Not even arguably, like definitively worse
t1_dt2bb5p	-0.735100	*	50000 Kurdish women and children butchered in the 1990s is hardly bullshit. 
t1_dt5e218	0.880800	*	There are a lot of people in favour of the pipeline also. It's only hypocritical if he said he'll shut it down and didn't.
t1_dt9nuly	-0.128000	*	It doesn't matter in this context
t1_dtawgh2	0.000000	*	 This is true, and I do not disagree, but the question then becomes what do we stand for, and where is our country going ?   Edit: Proper sentence structure.   
t1_dt5uuef	0.000000	*	Exactly my point.   Anything that confirms this bias is going to be treated as truth, anything which goes counter to this bias is going to be viewed as propaganda likely spread by Russian bots. 
t1_dt9k21z	-0.401900	*	If Pence is in the clear, I doubt it'd be hard to get 67 votes. Republicans would love their theocrat Pence in. 
t1_dt1qf68	0.401200	*	Wasn't the reason that angle was dropped is because studio execs thought the general audience was too dumb to understand the concept of cloud computing?
t1_dsy3n2q	-0.476700	*	> Other people said burger king owns it now, then another cited sources saying it was some Australian conglomerate.  The same Brazilian conglomerate now owns Burger King, Tim Horton's, and Popeyes.

t1_dstbno7	0.458800	*	dude edited about 8 of the 10 mistakes so far

t1_dsqc0ct	-0.177900	*	It still seems like that would be hard to prove, or I might be a cabbage.
t1_dt8uiv6	0.000000	*	Yes, but it appears that feminism is for equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.  The former requires tyranny - the latter only fairness.
t1_dtx6mr0	0.216800	*	You think the POTUS will be charged with anything less than watertight evidence? Why do you think this is taking so long?
t1_dswlt7q	0.000000	*	Bang on, you hit the nail square on the head with that one.
t1_dsrcbus	0.000000	*	For example you, I guess. You haven't stated one reason why it's good.
t1_dse37st	-0.554900	*	Yeah thats why hes going to win. You cant take something that you infer from someones statements and say that is the same as them actually stating it.
t1_dsf8trm	-0.510600	*	What has Verizon done to you?
t1_dsjtkpd	0.679400	*	That's OK! Editor titles and leadership structures can seem arcane even to us. But we all answer to Marty. Thank you so much for the support!

t1_dt55l0y	0.000000	*	In the nicest way possible I think you are completely correct. China agriculture and manufacturing is corrupt on a scale that makes even American and Brazilian corruption look like playground stuff.
t1_dt5da1t	0.000000	*	So not a democracy.
t1_dte8c80	0.000000	*	Yeah, it's not really worth putting any consideration into an allegation against a cop killing someone unlawfully, right?

t1_dta29jy	-0.742400	*	See. That's what I mean. Liberal isn't left. It isn't right either.  You don't even understand the basics. And then you throw in extremist for good measure.
t1_dtgmqrk	0.571900	*	Everybody come look at Alexi's post. Demetri, see how Alexi pull reversal. Vassily, you need do this more. Bonus  rubles for Alexi! Wodka for all!

t1_dtsyj5y	0.000000	*	They, and Russia, are the USA's current designated enemy, so that's the propaganda that goes out the most. Seasoned business travelers laugh at us rubes and our stupid mass media instilled worldview. 
t1_dswguky	-0.077200	*	It matters.  Soros cannot be allowed to continue his corruption of governments that don't follow his leftist agenda... obviously.
t1_dtdfw0l	0.000000	*	Hi when your leader lost the election by a million votes I don't think you live in a democracy

t1_dt8ulqw	0.601200	*	Can't tell if this is super serious or very sarcastic. I'm 19 in the UK so don't actually have much knowledge on the issue aha 
t1_du03351	-0.557400	*	Nice one. The poppy becomes a drug after it is synthesized or extracted...   Your logic is like saying dihydrous oxide is a drug because its used to make alcohol
t1_dtauh1y	0.000000	*	This mess has been going on since the Spanish, Mexico has always been this way?
t1_dt6agk0	0.000000	*	I would argue that many of the deniers are the same misinformants that are actively attacking us. The top warfare tactic is to covince your enemy that they're not being attacked.
t1_dt7h2ww	0.000000	*	Not enough native history gets taught in the US. These people existed here for thousands of years before too.
t1_dssqx48	-0.624900	*	I feel like you are conflating Muslims with the doctrines of Islam. 
t1_dt1rweq	-0.662600	*	Man, i don't think you get what income distribution is and how the rich has affected them.

t1_dt79t08	-0.395000	*	Germany reunified, it was very difficult and led to problems that persisted for decades, but now they have one of the world's strongest economies. 
t1_dtgl93l	0.000000	*	Which book?
t1_dsk5qep	-0.340000	*	> Getting mad at immigrants...   > hating poor people ...  Wow, lots of emotion you're injecting into a debate about policy. Sounds like you're the one full of rage and anger.

t1_dtvestq	0.000000	*	License fees almost universally go to conservation.

t1_dsw8knx	0.491900	*	Can you make that sound during a race to make other horses stop and pee?
t1_dtokcw5	0.318200	*	Old school mic drop, sounds like.
t1_dsk97to	0.000000	*	Yeah, Hollywood has way more impact on people than the Renaissance. People in Thailand don't see ads for the Renaissance on TV everyday.
t1_dt0hk50	0.296000	*	Made by foxconn. Apple tell foxconn what they want and then buy the product, apple don't make it.
t1_dtdtpq9	0.529600	*	Agreed. What I don't understand at all still are the women and people of color who voted for Trump and stand behind him. 
t1_dtkvfty	0.701000	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...
t1_dsvz32a	0.419900	*	BBQ Sauce.

t1_dt76ktf	-0.648600	*	Civilians that don't even understand how most modern technology works. It would be an economic disaster. You might as well try to adopt a country from 50 years ago through a time gate.

t1_dszykpu	0.025800	*	Yes adjusted for tax avoidance, which happens because of the outrageous flat rate. Thanks.

t1_dt6cwkg	0.000000	*	The article you quoted is from 2012 at 50%. Worldbank.org says 57% in 2016 so probably around 60% today. 
t1_dtvcay2	0.000000	*	Thats not even what trolling means. And there is no rule saying that lol. Stop making things up.
t1_dt39jbx	0.000000	*	Yeah, Israel invests a lot of money into water infrastructure. Still slowly drying up though.
t1_dthcrnp	-0.784500	*	You realize it takes effect Jan 1, 2018 right?    You know what, nevermind.  As the saying goes,  no point in trying to teach a pig to sing.  Waste of my time and it annoys the pig.
t1_dtdp7is	0.542300	*	No... The Tories were literally founded with the mission statement of supporting the upper classes. 
t1_dsg3xe1	0.648600	*	Prove that another shell won't just take that incumbent's place, and continue doing exactly what the incumbent did.  If your voters are dumb, your voters are dumb.  Term limits won't fix that.
t1_dtm26zt	-0.542300	*	Death is necessary, else we must stop breeding entirely.
t1_dsh1fk4	0.163300	*	It feels like shovelling shit in a wind tunnel, but somebody has to correct the liberal stupidity. 
t1_dt1kefp	0.102700	*	True, it's important to remember that there is a person on the other side of the keyboard as well. I apologize for calling your comment stupid. While I don't agree with what it, that was uncalled for.

t1_dt8slr1	0.000000	*	Where's that from?
t1_dskwel4	-0.177900	*	Well, 60% of the federal budget does go towards entitlements which does include things like Medicaid. 
t1_dteh08r	-0.805400	*	If you notice, you didnt actually address any of his points. This kind of lazy arguing will get you trump 2020. 
t1_dsjwwkz	0.458800	*	Is Afghanistan conquered and under US military rule yet? 
t1_dtub98z	0.831000	*	What is the difference between skepticism and closed-mindedness, in your opinion?

t1_dtnrhq6	-0.648600	*	Vote for candidates that are funded by the people and that are worth their salt in POLICY not surface level social issues. We hate bad things isnt good enough.

t1_dtcr966	0.361200	*	Of course! My partner eats meat. I'm happy to offer any kind of suggestions that will help. Even eating a single day a week (meatless monday) goes a long way for the planet.
t1_dtvfhkg	-0.476700	*	Eating is a necessity, but killing a chicken to eat isn't.
t1_dsudr2u	0.000000	*	Haven't changed my comment or stance. NoKo is a despicable regime.

t1_dt563i5	0.000000	*	Me neither! I've flipped back and forth on this forever. Is the sentence more about how there are ways or how there is a number?
t1_dsql886	0.000000	*	I haven't appealed at all. I was also rejected for unemployment. :(
t1_dszwkbv	0.000000	*	Plus backup, multiple routers, monitors, security for the storage location...it would use up much more space than a conventional system. 
t1_dtdugx9	0.000000	*	if we getup off of our butts and vote, and continue to vote, and run for elections ourselves, and then do that every year till we die, stuff can change
t1_dtsq4u9	0.000000	*	I am in my house dude.  And here we have the classic idiot-argument. It is commonly seen when someone doesn't have anything to contribute and wants to hop on a karma train.
t1_dstpdry	0.549900	*	so.. Gatorade? 
t1_dswojyr	-0.947400	*	Exactly. And that makes it pretty clear that, like a lot of groups these days, they don't truly believe in (or think about) what they preach.

t1_dtvtm3s	0.717700	*	Be quiet!

t1_dtcpg1q	-0.913600	*	That's the definition of it. 
t1_dtd11fm	0.000000	*	I would consider myself a classic republican by ideals. I'm saddened that this is apparently a party *position*. But science isn't a partisan issue. Science is science.
t1_dtr4zk6	0.000000	*	Doubt there are a lot of jobs for people with degrees in nuclear engineering in Vancouver...
t1_dtvgyg7	0.735500	*	Of course there were no polish death camps. But this law outlaws much more than just that specific phrase.

t1_dtvox0a	-0.549900	*	So canned hunting = modern meat farming?
t1_dti4ibi	0.748200	*	the fact that 97% voted state hood in proportion to 1.5% even though turn out was 23% only further proves my point.
t1_dtdyvb6	-0.025800	*	It's called bribery when I do it to get out of a speeding ticket.

t1_dtijz6j	-0.057200	*	Without sleep you won't survive more than 10 days. They saved your life.  edit: I'm wrong, 10-11 days is when you *start* dying, and not *end up* dying.
t1_dss8jk1	0.318200	*	But you're talking about it going back up after it dips as if it's a certainty. 
t1_dsdfjs0	0.294200	*	I'm sorry for the redundancy that so offended you.  But I'm not changing it.  I could have put a therefore in there, but I'm on my phone and I don't really care enough.

t1_dt6y5q2	0.783400	*	I mean yeah. It's important to actually explain why it's fake news, but the contention was whether manipulative narratives count as fake news, and they do.
t1_dta4ux5	0.966800	*	You probably were top 5-10% at top law school too
t1_dsrnys7	-0.335000	*	That's right they are known for that, especially in all the countries we invaded and they don't have black concentration camps known as prisons. 
t1_dtp1abq	0.000000	*	While I agree with you, it's pretty common for countries to lie about how many losses they have in a fight, I guess for morale.
t1_dsfkgmh	0.102700	*	What's the matter, don't you know about Israel history? 
t1_dtkx665	-0.447900	*	Unless you have an inelastic commodity, like, I don't know, food.

t1_dt28c9x	0.000000	*	> Marxism has been tried.  Let me fix that for you: Marxism**-Leninism** has been tried.  You do know that there are more than one strand of Marxism today, right?
t1_dt44o1b	0.802000	*	Die welt __literally is a conservative newspaper.__ You saying no it's not is simply ignoring the fact that they have a conservative editorial bent and conservative readership.
t1_dsmsa7z	-0.571900	*	I want crime not to pay. I want criminals to actually pay their debt back to society. Prison is not meant to be a holiday camp.
t1_dt1aws9	0.000000	*	I disagree. An uneducated populace is easy to sway toward not voting in their best interest, which destroys the beholden to the people benefit. See: Donald *fucking* Trump.
t1_dt1j6l2	0.000000	*	Do you really think legalizing cocaine and heroin is a solution? 
t1_dsita53	-0.296000	*	You know if you put your money in a bank you can wire transfer it to other people for free, it's fast, and if your account is ever robbed you are covered up to a few hundred thousand.

t1_dskpskg	-0.624000	*	So basically you're saying if you're born in a shithole you shouldn't be allowed to leave? Like some international caste system? 
t1_dsevkq0	-0.624900	*	So 10+ cases from a company with 70k people working is proof of systematic bias? And most of them are not related to being white men but being sexist or part of the far right.
t1_dt0g349	-0.265800	*	For the first time in history, walls do not keep people out. Thank you for discovering the follie of thousands of years prior to the US making the mistake one more time.

t1_dto6af4	0.340000	*	True. If the US completely eliminated military spending from the budget, we would still be running a deficit due to Medicare and Medicaid. 
t1_dthb73h	0.000000	*	Man to many vines have turned your ability to see nuance to shit
t1_dtiukrq	0.693400	*	The trend is that Russia will be seen as a force for good?  Then humanity is fucked.

t1_dsp7kst	0.000000	*	You're a crackhead.
t1_dsq5w8y	-0.963300	*	How exactly is prisoners working as punishment racist? I could see maybe saying that because black people make up a large proportion of prisoners that it's racist but the law is not inherently racist

t1_dsq3sfv	0.000000	*	It's funny. You guys can't decide whether you love Bill Burr because of his edgy commentary on feminism, or hate him because he recognizes that where there are white people, there is racism. 
t1_dstubxg	0.380200	*	Perfect for the country and others around it too!  Nothing like creating a power vacuum for the worst people in the world to take over and create even more concentration camps (I.e. Khmer Rouge).

t1_dslv62n	0.790600	*	Why is their heritage of so much interest? Would you ask a 'white' person with an American accent the same thing as an introduction?
t1_dsjyfdd	0.372400	*	These arguments conveniently ignore Canada which has better social mobility and has health care, it's not homogenous. It also ignores the fact that most European countries are not homogenous.

t1_dsyus9c	0.872000	*	Because they were so accurate in determining the winner of the election.  Obviously something in their models was not capturing all the variables correctly.

t1_dsjv19e	0.771700	*	So obama was a saint and the rest of our presidents were scum. You really think that? Thats called PR. Obama spent 90% of his time on his image. 
t1_dtmo0lk	0.000000	*	Actually the law says we can grow 2 plants for personal consumption, with restrictions on plant height and amount you can possess all at once. 
t1_dsdxol1	-0.102700	*	That's true it's when you *choose* one over the other when both are wrong that their is implicit acceptance, just the existence doesn't make it true. Fair enough!
t1_dta3s6b	0.000000	*	What you're advocating is laicism, not secularism.

t1_dtivvjs	-0.591600	*	What was he supposed to do, just ignore congress?
t1_dtdlxfr	0.125500	*	 I'd imagine that part of his support is due to what often happens to his opposition. Navalny was jailed 3 times in 2017... that has what is called a chilling effect. 
t1_dtac5uf	-0.139100	*	It might have something to do with all the third degree burns and shit that she got.

t1_dtvpa2u	-0.879900	*	Could just be he wanted to go and do it himself. I do think people who eat meat then proceed to complain about hunters are quite hypocritical. 
t1_dsjemf2	0.322200	*	But why? you have yet to say why. That's what I'm curious about.  If you have personal issues, changing the country or place you are at won't solve those issues. 
t1_dtrc7nu	0.401900	*	You just reminded me of the old palm pilot my mom gave me as a kid, which said it could store web addresses, and I was so let down that it couldn't actually do the internet in the palm of my hand. 
t1_dtkvfty	0.380400	*	I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  Big Pharma will most likely find something that at least blocks some diseases...for a nice monthly fee of overpriced medicines...

t1_dsi54oi	0.600300	*	Why though? Russia, outside of it's nukes it can't use, it a fucking joke. Piss ant economy and garbage military. Why do we allow them to act like they matter?

t1_dt5ah35	0.153100	*	You make that sound bad.  Get Americans to pay tax to reduce the price of milk in Canada?  That would be great for Canadian consumers.
t1_dsqehgm	0.000000	*	Yeah neither of those links shows her being a leftist. You can't just link to random things and claim it's a source.

t1_dtg8nwq	0.000000	*	If I had to guess, I'd say because he fell for the trap of believing news that sounds too good to be true.  Once you start down that dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
t1_dt2mkxf	-0.296000	*	Agreed.  *Sky Fairy* is a trollish term for god, I won't deny that.  Although *supernatural creator being who existed before existence* can be a bit of a mouthful...

t1_dt8wmu1	0.000000	*	Do you really think speech and movement are at all the same, and that insulting or making fun of someone is the same as trespassing on their private property?
t1_dt3bhm4	-0.937100	*	After 50+ years of occupation ofcourse there is quite alot of resentment and hatred, you do not govern through an opinion poll. 
t1_dsv94cr	0.000000	*	What about the 120,000 Canadians that overstayed their visas last year? Should we ban Canadian visas?
t1_dsj3gtt	-0.102700	*	Even then I think they usually just call the police. The FAA is more likely to come after you if you violate airspace, crash your airplane, or buzz an FAA inspector in your airplane.
t1_dso351h	0.851500	*	Nope, Ive never actually worked in IT. I do love to visit r/talesfromtechsupport. If that sub has taught me anything its that anybody no matter what their profession can be a complete moron.
t1_dtakt9s	-0.476700	*	If that's not allowed in the US either then I'm wondering why so many people, from the US, seem to think that Germany has so much worse laws?

t1_dtjckm9	0.699700	*	That's like saying there was an Anti-Semitism Party in Germany before World War I. There was, but it didn't become popular until after the war. 
t1_dswwey2	0.547700	*	Well no. Bill of Rights 1689. The crown can't execute or dispense laws without consent of Parliament. 
t1_dst2php	-0.792500	*	Huh? I'm just telling you the source of the meme. Look it up and you'll see it's not an acronym.

t1_dtf9dhn	0.361200	*	The middle East is fucked up and our culture at the moment is much more progressive. That isn't racist that's true. That doesn't mean Muslims themselves are terrible people

t1_dsz1smg	-0.250000	*	Can anyone find a statistic on the infant mortality rate of the US but divided by race? Im sure once its separated by race, the results will be way more shocking.

t1_dtv1jvr	0.000000	*	This law does not make it illegal to point out individual collaborators nor does it seek to white wash that. It makes it illegal to ascribe Nazi Crimes to the Polish State or The Polish People.

t1_dtg4av8	-0.510600	*	More Scotts support remaining with the UK now than the Indyref result, and the SNP lost a lot of seats to the Tories in the 2017 GE. So why waste time and money on another referendrum?
t1_dtm2vb2	0.777600	*	Right? So easy to piss on something thats given the best living conditions ever without attempt to offer a better replacement.

t1_dt8t0ee	-0.961800	*	What they are trying to say is that an employer can fire you AT WILL. They do not have to give a reason. They are not insinuating that an employer can make you do whatever they want.
