t1_dss271l	-0.104300	*	Omg I'm pretty libertarian on most things but holy shit I wish we paid teachers more.  I would absolutely support cutting every federal program by 1% to fund increasing k-12 teacher's salaries.

t1_dtx51or	0.000000	*	(from the US) yep - voting integrity should really be a federal issue and not something left to the states to decide, at least for federal elections.

t1_dtdcn5q	0.565300	*	No the idea is to force an altogether better agreement. One that doesnt screw us and actually benefits those who agree to the stipulations.
t1_dsg6y3g	0.194800	*	You will never have conclusive proof without a camera in the room.  Their testimony and his general sleazebag attitude convinces me.
t1_dth8290	0.000000	*	Lincoln falls into the second category.   Also there's a lot of people out there saying Trump didn't provide the information necessary to justify the discretionary authority.

t1_dsxvi33	-0.936600	*	I am done trying to debate guns on a clearly non-gun thread. I let someone pull me into it, bad on me. My earlier point stands. The problem is the will to kill and not the method.

t1_dt5xlx3	0.635300	*	Yes, but in many places, govt doesn't care or doesn't have enough resources, so a lot of things slip through the cracks.
t1_dsg21yq	0.000000	*	So you're suggesting we ignore the congress and the senate committees because you don't like who controls it? That doesn't seem very constitutional
t1_dtfuw3i	0.000000	*	no, it really isn't, because the tribal councils have a geographically limited domain
t1_dtvmlch	0.599400	*	Trump said he would be willing to renegotiate. Instead of doing so, European countries just decided to cry about and point at the big mean USA. The EU is a joke.

t1_dsxjxb9	-0.659700	*	I'm sorry is that your attempt at trying to save face when you say something you can't really back up. Just make some kind of weird, vague allusion to Trump? That's....really sad.

t1_dtwqfu1	0.000000	*	I get how you feel at least, everyone gets mad when their beliefs are ridiculed or brought into question. Democrats and Republicans alike, its human nature to be passionate about what we believe in.
t1_dtf1qwg	-0.102700	*	So fuck these victims because there's not enough of them?
t1_dsf4l46	0.692100	*	What stance is that? Your stance of its better to go along with terrorists because they might kill you.
t1_dsfaotv	0.790600	*	Yeah... The west doesn't go to war or interfere unless the US has some kind of material gain from it.  Did the UN at least send an angry letter?

t1_dtvnxyp	-0.796000	*	I don't think that hold water either.  Lions are endangered.  Deer are not.  Hunting lions threatens their existence.  I think hunting a lion in nature is worse, if anything.

t1_dsshxhw	-0.921300	*	I'm pretty sure that when the bible was actually written, it was meant to be taken literally.  Some christians no longer take it literally, just like some muslim no longer take the quran literally.
t1_dtxwqr5	0.000000	*	Nope, that'd be due to political pressure from the US to extradite him by any means including false charges.

t1_dsh8dbj	0.273200	*	Yep. And increasing the minimum wage is meant to have wages catch up to inflation a but because the cost of living and wages have not taken a parallel growth.
t1_dshk0f5	-0.493900	*	And if it were Al Qaeda I would say, remember when the US armed the Mujahideen?? You're still not getting the point of this exercise.

t1_dsv2i9e	0.870800	*	How can you say that when there have been 2 million new jobs created and companies officially stating new/transfer of manufacturing factories back into specific states? Oh, it's denial.

t1_dsn8xnc	0.657000	*	Correct, Trump claimed the other day to have sold a bunch of F-52s to some country. Norway maybe?

t1_dt4plck	0.318200	*	Probably because law? They wouldn't count as full-time employed. Also, other people besides coders would protest unfair treatment...
t1_dtigcwp	-0.458800	*	I remember when Reagan was President it was a scandal that toilet seats on B-52s cost $700. Such innocent times...
t1_dt91xmp	-0.340000	*	I fired comey because of the Russia thing 
t1_dtcoqdh	0.439000	*	Youre one of those. Plenty of friends of mine have their own chickens and cows. They are not abusing their animals, thanks for your shitty opinion.
t1_dsz679d	0.757900	*	I wish they wouldn't do that. It's incredibly easy to clone a phone using the same stuff this kid did. 
t1_dslvpkd	0.525600	*	I legitimately try to learn the pronunciation and everything, but kind of got the idea I shouldn't even ask in the first place. In western terms, it would be a respectful idea but....

t1_dtvw132	0.000000	*	You just put the starting pay at $120k. That's pretty insane for starting pay.  I think you're just used to the luxury, considering most of us couldn't even choose the $60k job if we wanted.
t1_dthkc91	-0.296000	*	You just restated your statement from before. How are the bad and inappropriate but Trumps are not?.
t1_dt6t9vw	0.592700	*	That's metric pages. Way different.
t1_dsmz3q7	0.214400	*	the one thing russia has always been ahead of the united states in is rocket technology, the north korean's new icbm is based on a very reliable model.   north korea won, its time for talks and peace.

t1_dt4xwby	0.640800	*	Yeh I was incorrectly judging my back of envelope calculations on higher than average salaries which top out the higher tax bands. Your analysis is a great contribution. 
t1_dt2ris6	0.273200	*	Yours was likely more modern and/or more rational than mine. I'd be willing to bet yours was in the minority though, especially going back more than 20 years.

t1_dtb0n01	0.870800	*	and you claim to be a Christian based on various posts you make.. is there not something about not judging in the bible?
t1_dt044o5	-0.534500	*	Erm, no it doesn't. If rotation of Earth was the factor, you would expect the range of missile to be skewed towards west, not east.

t1_dt6ywvg	0.629300	*	Why would it be expensive?

t1_dtssmlw	-0.403300	*	Hate speech has those ramifications and more. And also hate speech are also generally lies. Which is defamation. So theyre very related.
t1_dtqu867	-0.401900	*	It's all crap bullshit activist nonsense. Mann is scum, both as a supposed scientist and as a human being.
t1_dtvgwzp	0.836000	*	Wow, I never would have guessed you'd put your reply in bold. Lame. Your comment is no more important than any other. You're not calling out anything.

t1_dt2jqrc	-0.659700	*	Average painter gets negative feedback and turns into mass murdering fuck head
t1_dsl745z	0.648600	*	I do too. Rewatching the video I can't help but feel like Obama fell into the same trap that Reagan did; he assumed Americans were better people than we actually are.

t1_dtjux51	0.000000	*	That's complaining.
t1_dtdwb5q	-0.104500	*	And the laws (or lack thereof) that make legal corruption possible are influenced by the same legal corruption that made the laws. It's a vicious cycle.

t1_dsl1ceh	0.025800	*	He never said it was part of the EU, he said it was part of Europe, which it is. Just because they arent part of the EU doesnt mean they arent part of the continent. 
t1_dtczhj4	0.025800	*	Its certainly better for business AND for money to support science and innovation. This anti-intelligence crusade their party is on will cripple the us economy if it wins out.

t1_dt6du26	0.645600	*	I know that I can't expect the Catholic Church to suddenly become progressive. And that's proven by the fact that his Pope isn't progressive either. He just has a better PR.  
t1_dtogxd1	-0.175900	*	>So now it's a contest to see who killed more   I don't know! I'm not the one who started this chain. If it was up to me we wouldn't be having a fucking contest. It's fucking inane.
t1_dsfu7w3	0.750600	*	I have negative faith in the repubs.
t1_dslowgg	-0.526700	*	Why do you deem animals to be more deserving of life than plants? They are living creatures too.
t1_dstt8f6	0.296000	*	70 years is three generations. That is anything but new.   But seeing them being recognized as such, even by Israeli, that is new.

t1_dtlfclw	0.000000	*	*shrug*   Okay. What does that have to do with American universities though? They're not taking these grads from anyone. They want to come here.
t1_dslpj3p	0.949900	*	Corruption's got nothing to do with it. A managed and orderly decrease in population will result in a shortage of consumers to buy things. This kills the economy. You do *not* want that to happen.
t1_dtln9uj	0.649800	*	Problem lies in the inherent racism of getting a permit, Israelis can get permits, palestinians get theirs denied 90%+ of times. It makes this legality counter arguement alot less valid.
t1_dt8m2qh	0.000000	*	The crux of the issue is that the initial claim is an antisemitic lie. Its simply not true.   
t1_dt45rd5	0.296000	*	> because they know they will get rejected.  Because none of those countries have signed the refugee convention, so they're under no obligation to take any refugees. 
t1_dtizs8w	0.921600	*	I think that making homeless shelters safer would be money better spent. Personally, I think that lockable sleeping berths (like pod hotels) would be a cost-effective solution.
t1_dtg9ndo	-0.513100	*	What do you mean by 'casual workers'?  I'm from the U.S. and would think 'casual' would be the opposite of 'professional' but that doesn't make sense in context.
t1_dse6ymv	0.077200	*	Death and suffering changes minds.
t1_dtw1npe	0.340800	*	That's an anomaly, or maybe they published the stats before the end of 2015, and we can also look at Sweden, but you didn't want that, as that doesn't prove your theory. 
t1_dsdgt7u	-0.510600	*	Not sure about that, maybe it's possible to land in a way that allows you to stay conscious for like a minute before you pass out and die from blood loss and lack of some organs.
t1_dtczhj4	0.493900	*	Its certainly better for business AND for money to support science and innovation. This anti-intelligence crusade their party is on will cripple the us economy if it wins out.

t1_dsfluhz	-0.875000	*	Yeah Trump is the real outsider fighting for the average man by filling the White House with Goldman Sachs employees and his children.
t1_dsh8hhr	0.000000	*	Yep. Where I grew up, Sears was the Anchor store for the mall. Sears became shitty, and the mall became basically abandoned. I doubt that property is worth much.
t1_dt0bjqp	-0.381800	*	Looks like a have different political perspective than you time to throw insults at me. 
t1_dtbuy29	0.000000	*	What are you insinuating? Nazi Germany was a fascist regime and not complying with orders had dire consequences. 
t1_dsfkjgo	0.000000	*	Nah, I think Football = Football
t1_dsjwg7f	0.000000	*	It's not. It was just an example.  Your outer points are more extreme.  Your poorest are poorer and your richest are richer.
t1_dtjjm2h	0.102700	*	Being impeached doesnt mean he is kicked out of office, it just means he would be committed of a crime. It would be up to the senate i believe to kick him out. And they won't want to get rid of him. 
t1_dtobxuu	0.571900	*	A change that might be 170 times faster than average. There's no way to say for certain,  because data of this kind wasn't collected prior to the industrial revolution. 
t1_dtiwbee	-0.525400	*	But regardless of medical need vs cosmesis, my dick looks the same afterwards. Therefore for one to be mutilation, they would both be mutilation. 
t1_dt6pndp	-0.639500	*	And you'll notice no country's been forced to accept refugees. And, in particular, countries that were doing the fucking up overseas have not accepted them in with open arms, either.

t1_dskzof3	-0.526700	*	Not really.  Everyone can just agree it was an unlawful order.  Unlawful orders don't need to be followed.
t1_dt55ohy	-0.778300	*	Read the history of Hollywood. Avoiding IP was actually one of the primary reasons it came to prominence. Lower taxes and weather were also factors.

t1_dso5kom	0.000000	*	Bitcoin and similar enterprises prove that upwards-movement is entirely possible if you make good choices. Very good choices, yes, but the opportunity is present.

t1_dt94slp	-0.536200	*	Why would anyone care about upvotes? They're about as useful as tits on a bull. Also are you implying McCarthy did something wrong?

t1_dstqhhm	-0.361200	*	So you cherry pick what you like in the article and dismiss what you dont like in it. I dont know who you think youre going to convince here with that line of reasoning.
t1_dta60rs	0.273200	*	This is not really comparable. /u/kazga makes a good point comparing it to bail money instead of civil forfeiture. A law like this does not really exist in Germany.
t1_dthp4ev	-0.612400	*	Still better than /askthe_donald
t1_dt60ajq	0.556300	*	That guy wasn't even really anti-Trump. Mueller got rid of him to avoid any potential conflicts and to take away a talking point.

t1_dtfd4o4	0.817600	*	To test our faith. Are you somehow implying that his omnipotence would logically clash with his creation of shaitan? I don't understand your implication here. 
t1_dt90nqk	0.401900	*	If you still couldn't understand it after having it explained you can fuck right off because you're beyond help.
t1_dtqghuf	-0.062600	*	Buddy, prohibition ended a century ago. Calling 3 beers a night alcoholism is near Volstead act levels of pearl clutching.

t1_dsh43oa	0.470300	*	You feel smart yet?
t1_dtp6jxb	0.077200	*	Except that's not how it works.  Few people wanted to kill unarmed civilians-- most war crimes were the realm of highly stressed individuals breaking down, or the axis powers.
t1_dttt8d4	-0.964600	*	Yeah, they may not be in jail, but they do get to experience the financial hardship of  job hunting with a criminal record for the rest of their life. 
t1_dskisa8	-0.526700	*	Too many people like him because they claim Trump only says out loud what people are thinking.  
t1_dsm4etc	-0.102700	*	Actually it is. But these kind of conversations don't appear in the media or internet headlines so you read only about the ones which are not normal.
t1_dtf1qwg	-0.802000	*	So fuck these victims because there's not enough of them?
t1_dslaom7	0.700300	*	Well it's at least undeniable that something to do with the presidency has a huge affect on the markets.

t1_dt3etn5	-0.226300	*	That's kinda... scary.
t1_dst00v6	-0.916900	*	At least most of those people weren't tortured to death. I'd rather go out in a flash.
t1_dsdsn4y	-0.718400	*	Did those jobs not exist before 2002? and you are out of your mind if you think they are all employed and not using welfare. 
t1_dseyhb5	0.514500	*	The Damore memo made no claims about superiority - it simply said there are biological gender differences and discussed ways to get more women into tech; it was literally pro-hiring women.
t1_dtujqhh	0.159000	*	But also no longer really a jury that represents the community as a whole
t1_dta7e1y	0.226300	*	Undercut... but damn close.
t1_dtnwqea	0.000000	*	We're not even at the point of shooting at each other yet  You obviously haven't spoken to some of these die-hard Trump supporters, they talk about killing liberals all the time. 
t1_dskz9ps	0.624000	*	If 500 billion fucking dollars in revenue isn't good enough for you then I don't know what to tell you. Walmart is one of the most successful corporations in human history.
t1_dt002mk	0.000000	*	Just sayin' that pros can disable security systems (not like in the movies). A strong magnet will fake that a door is still closed.

t1_dtn6jnh	0.339100	*	What other government issued id would be cheaper and easier to get? 
t1_dsy04yp	0.889400	*	So by allowing abortions, they reduce the amount of abortions.  What if they allowed theft if it meant a reduction in theft?
t1_dtrcri4	0.000000	*	Me too. Yet somehow the population is growing. 
t1_dsjxdgb	0.340000	*	That's the thing. Scale it down. you shoot it with a rifle. Scale it up, use the big toys.  At this point why not use a guided or u guided missile.
t1_dsuxnad	0.273200	*	So because someone voted for trump they automatically don't like people with dark scin?
t1_dsusib1	0.000000	*	We elect Australia?

t1_dtet61t	-0.823800	*	From a human rights perspective I dont see anything wrong with my equivalency. The complaint should be an issue of national sovereignty.

t1_dt1nl30	-0.202300	*	Where did I make any claims of numbers? Where have I said anything about capitalism. All I'm saying is that Bommunism is garbage. It's not really a controversial fact, either.

t1_dsg0gby	0.128000	*	Far smaller segment of Bernie supporters than you would think.  More Bernie voters voted for Clinton in the general than Clinton voters did for Obama.

t1_dt9gytu	0.735100	*	What does any of that have to do with the Democrats had 8 years?  That would imply Dems had full control of government, just as conservatives do now.  Having a Democrat president doesnt count.
t1_dsk7q8r	-0.657100	*	Yeah, nah. The side that co-opts white supremacy always loses.  Always. There's retarded and then there's pants on your head, batshit insane.
t1_dsfk7z7	0.578900	*	I just think typing soccer and football is easier than adding a countries name before football in both cases.

t1_dt9zr8s	0.077200	*	None of what you stated was sourced or proven either. Its funny that the far right holds itself to a lower standard than the left.

t1_dtcwke9	-0.432900	*	Umm.. you just described the electoral system again using an oversimplified analogy and then called me a Trump supporter. Neither of those things are arguments against the electoral college. 
t1_dta25m4	0.000000	*	You're lieing  Edit: Sure, downvote but you better have data in hand. Else you can suck on your own BS.

t1_dthj6ru	-0.402300	*	Did you even read the articles? No of course not.  > The Republican-led House Oversight Committee  I don't even know why I bother with evidence. Must be wild to be unable to trust facts.    
t1_dtfetd3	0.128000	*	No, I'm wondering why it got zero air time and zero mentions.  Seems like a really good issue to be in support of for that group.

t1_dtokt39	0.440400	*	Pretty much. It used to be standard at the end of all mathematical proofs until they started replacing it with a solid square. It's a shame tbh because it doesn't have that same mic-drop feel.
t1_dsg4tdz	0.000000	*	You missed the imagine part. Though, you do seem like the kind of person who would be sure of something you imagined. 
t1_dt6hl8u	-0.750100	*	I guess I just don't see killing defenseless animals with our superior technology, for sport, as much of an accomplishment.   
t1_dtwrrdq	0.421500	*	And the US can say Goodbye to most of their employment as well. Both sides would be hit hard. The question is, which side is more ready to do it.
t1_dt5wpl5	0.612400	*	Thats actually a really fascinating read...  Not sure whats supposed to be so damning about the linked article...?  Edit: words, and wow...subtle Captain Cheeto reference in there.

t1_dsmccv9	-0.065700	*	That's fair, there's tons of better reasons to criticize Trump. I was just making a quick comment on how Trump isn't really doing his job, and didn't mean that much with it, but still, fair is fair. 
t1_dt1c0ng	0.000000	*	I want to know what world you live in that Hillary was horribly unqualified. I didn't like her, but lack of qualifications was never an issue. 
t1_dsj9iyd	0.000000	*	I guessing you were not even born in the 1990s.  Everybody loved the fuck out of Bill Clinton (except congressional Republicans).  
t1_dtj7u9j	0.636900	*	Well if it's like any of the bay area homeless people, they just get free tents from people and sleep there. It's like camping every day of your life.
t1_dtk0qme	-0.648000	*	Apologies, I meant to say Lorde is not playing for Putin. 
t1_dsdj7ld	-0.788200	*	That's what my comment is saying. That said, doesn't mean I can't talk about how tarded it is to vote for a tard.
t1_dsovxer	0.000000	*	Not if you are using electric buses.

t1_dsq9h25	0.875000	*	You are guessing and you are guessing wrongly. But that's cool, the POTUS lets his freak flag fly that way too, so do it while the window is open I guess.
t1_dt0ia8i	0.771200	*	That game was invented during the Great Depression.  Its called monopoly.  If you played it, you know how it ends.
t1_dttnb9h	-0.757900	*	Well, our nation is moving backwards. I'd happily go to Canada if that meant I wouldn't be financially dead if I got hurt. 
t1_dtvim7a	-0.179000	*	The latter.   But that you thought you had a point is hilarious.
t1_dto3y29	-0.735100	*	So your candidate did lose then. Good to know. That whole LOL I didn't vote for Hillary champ was some pedantic gotcha moment your liberal brain came up with.

t1_dsgq5gn	-0.128000	*	Oh no, i understand. I just think leaving them alone and defenseless (by dying) is *more* of a risk (and therefore less rewarding) than having yourself survive to continue looking for food elsewhere. 
t1_dt312sz	-0.527500	*	Are all of these quotes verbatim? Im having a hard time grasping how profoundly retarded Trump is. 
t1_dtf0isl	0.000000	*	The hierarchy of the Catholic church is certainly sexist.   And I think OP was saying women priests might be nice since the vast majority of sexual crimes (and violent crimes) are committed by men. 
t1_dslvri3	0.000000	*	So I'm not allowed to ask anyone who isn't white where they're from, because apparently that means I'm assuming they're from a different country?  Do you really not see how stupid your comment is...
t1_dsxfuus	-0.695600	*	He just used your own line of argument against you, and you danced to it like a rube.  Holy shit this is good.

t1_dtev1qz	-0.163200	*	No, zhe is saying they don't want to stand by the things they have said. By the way,  you shouldn't asume gender, it's too easy to hurt feelings. It's 2018

t1_dthkhkh	0.000000	*	People are trying to, but bear in mind most policymakers are 40+ with several properties to their name - so they drag their heels on any reform intentionally.

t1_dsv90r0	0.000000	*	Do you not think trump's language and proposed nationalist policies have emboldened them? Or brought those tendencies out in many others?   Edit: for clarity

t1_dt2wzss	0.000000	*	LOL - from my perspective it most certainly did.  He was a catastrophe for my side (Democrats).  He is the reason why we are where we are now.  Don't be blind, my friend.

t1_dse120j	0.616300	*	What a waste of breath. Maybe it is clear, but then don't immediately use whataboutism to overshadow his point with absolutely no regard to whether or not his point is accurate. 
t1_dtvow0w	0.000000	*	It's not wrong. Try less hard next time to troll. It's a bit too obvious.

t1_dtil42i	-0.102700	*	Oh yeah, excellent point. The wealthy Americans were totally sharing that wealth with the Cuban people and definitely not hoarding it all to themselves.

t1_dtf6iqp	-0.562900	*	My point is that you can't overstate the barbarism of Iran's treatment of women. There is no argument to be made on the degree of mistreatment.

t1_dsfk4bm	-0.588800	*	It costs less to kill someone with a life sentence than it does to feed them for the duration of their sentence.  Also Giving them running water and heat and shelter.   
t1_dsxq2c2	0.486000	*	I have none of those things... I got a STEM degree from an affordable state school... I am currently employed and pay 87$ a month for health insurance...   So ya.. I like tax cuts and prosperity. 
t1_dtvnqf3	-0.025800	*	People have to eat. Yes, you can argue that people should just eat plants, but thats not always an option.  
t1_dt6yfp7	0.000000	*	I think you're trying too hard to be clever. 
t1_dtbb2fo	0.790600	*	You could hang truck nuts on a Prius xaf\\\_()_/xaf 
t1_dsk75ef	0.903700	*	In different ways, yes, but ultimately everyone is susceptible to biases and flaws.
t1_dt5xocs	0.859100	*	It has a regrettably strong history, although previously it was a matter of sabotaging the president of the other party in order to make them look bad during the election.
t1_dtoi4jj	0.960100	*	That's not how that works. They enter deals with people they *prefer* to work with, not because there is literally no other market to pursue. 
t1_dslxk9d	-0.612400	*	So the complaints are all about presentation? 
t1_dto68gb	0.000000	*	You're bloody brainwashed mate. No one wants the US acting like the world police and fucking things up in foreign countries anymore.
t1_dsuwm6o	0.000000	*	Because it's a dog whistle for the same folks who cheered when he said all Haitians have AIDS. 
t1_dt7044b	0.000000	*	Define minimal means? How would you factor in cost of living for different areas?  And why exactly 40 hours?
t1_dsznppr	-0.907700	*	Butthurt Americans can't handle the truth.  ;)
t1_dsvb1l3	-0.542300	*	The war on drugs is completely pointless. The point of gun control is to keep thousands of murders from happening in your country
t1_dsngepx	0.000000	*	But most of these 260 attacks aren't serious crimes, right? Spraypainting a mosque with mean Muslim stuff makes you a dick and will get you arrested, but it's hardly at the level of beating their ass.
t1_dtkyhvy	-0.567300	*	high cost is actually part of a solution. If antibiotics weren't so dirt-cheap - especially last-resort antibiotics - they wouldn't be used in such a widespread manner.
t1_dty7w7x	0.000000	*	unread
t1_dtty74d	0.421500	*	It works for me, but it's a joke at Ellison's expense. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deathbird) the link to the short story.

t1_dsn26hs	-0.296000	*	Would it be possible to track the course of the missile and have a bunch of F-22 try to crash into it at an altitude exceeding the radius of the explosion?
t1_dt1ofj3	0.700300	*	Unfortunately unless we get a not for profit healthcare industry I don't think our system will become a single payer system. It's too driven by profit. 
t1_dsqd2fh	-0.241100	*	Why can't they? I know many US born folks that have already emigrated here and live here for years now. Not to mention, we still have about 50,000 of Americas draft dodgers that Clinton pardoned.
t1_dtqghuf	0.695600	*	Buddy, prohibition ended a century ago. Calling 3 beers a night alcoholism is near Volstead act levels of pearl clutching.

t1_dttei9y	-0.172500	*	What can xa3200K get you that xa3100K can't? After a certain point money becomes meaningless and earning any more is either greed or a desire to see a bigger number.

t1_dt3gosf	-0.864500	*	fact is he knowingly sold booze and knew it could lead to this. A bull did not have the same choice.

t1_dsguyi9	-0.935100	*	Minimum wage of $7 an hour for 10 hours a week is still enough to buy beans rice, and some fresh vegetables and in season cheaper fruits.
t1_dtaqkdk	0.202300	*	MSNBC is nowhere near the opposite end of the spectrum from Fox News. Far right to MAAAAAYYYBE center left is the full breadth of the cable TV spectrum. 
t1_dsv2x0l	0.493900	*	The worse thing that could happen to Palestine would be sovereignty.   Then the first rocket attack would be an act of war and Israel could legally shit kick.
t1_dtg2nbg	-0.340000	*	Because their regions have important issues that aren't necessarily understood by people on the coasts, but that doesn't make their issues any less important.
t1_dt75epz	0.000000	*	Are you making more or less than the average wage?
t1_dt2nxm5	-0.661300	*	Well, maybe all those who got hunted by Chinese government also committed crimes, you know, stuff like breaking Chinese laws is frowned upon in China.

t1_dsk1gqk	-0.559600	*	What has he done wrong exactly?  Nothing that's been proven.  So what the fuck are you even going on about. 
t1_dsk5ssw	-0.153100	*	You kinda projected into baguette's comment pretty hard there at the end
t1_dsg4t2b	-0.598300	*	Talking post-primary is ignoring when the sin occurred and pretending that it's not a sin any more.
t1_dt1xukj	0.458800	*	Which is why they should be heavily taxed.
t1_dsxdr4w	0.000000	*	In the US we have a large deer and coyote problem. We may be okay for a little while.

t1_dt4klf6	0.000000	*	While I am sorry you have been cursed with a very weak stomach and constitution, most people can barely register weed being smoked around them.

t1_dsz4l6e	0.000000	*	You just validated every white supremacists argument. 
t1_dttwe0m	0.000000	*	The Brits, even with their royalty, have more class mobility than we do in the States.

t1_dtn0dvk	-0.373600	*	I'm not denying that point at all, as that is completely and totally irrelevant to the conversation we are having.  If you think it's relevant and key, explain how - in detail

t1_dt9ak8b	0.502300	*	Uhh, China's more or less always owned Hong Kong.  The British literally landed boats and had it taken away from them, then signed a 100 year lease on it which is expiring.
t1_dslbai3	-0.202300	*	I did read the article? Can you link to me where I admitted I did not read the article?   Also, nice strawman again. You need to work on staying focused in your argumentation.
t1_dtb7a03	0.051600	*	> your right  Insulting people for their ignorance while using your instead of you're.  This might be the most quintessential internet comment ever.

t1_dsvoev7	0.000000	*	I'm dead!!??
t1_dt0jrce	-0.784500	*	>Russia took Georgia  That's what you wrote. Don't act surprised now if you think people get confused by you stating that one country (Russia) literally occupied a whole other country (Georgia). 
t1_dsdu5bu	0.090500	*	Yea, that is why you need government to do oversight and keep companies honest but not provide the service themselves. Then you have a nice division of labor.
t1_dth30v9	0.633500	*	Please tell me your joking. Because i can honestly believe people would be offended by something as dumb as this.

t1_dtihzqg	-0.661900	*	The things he's doing to Puerto Rico are beyond cruelty.  His political beliefs are genocidal.

t1_dsuq2n1	0.864100	*	I've never heard of this. So if it is not a de facto dictatorship then who are these people who actually run it? It's not like they have giant corporations running things.
t1_dtvtohc	0.810300	*	I mean, if you want to use the literal definition of the stupid shit you just said, then all thy sons command only represents slightly less than half the Canadian population too.
t1_dtghbz3	0.801900	*	You had a successful circumcision by your choice, yes. That's not what was being discussed, unless you are one of these intellectually dishonest people.
t1_dt7cc3f	0.318200	*	Yeah making fun of the mainstream media for falling for it.

t1_dsdp8h8	0.375800	*	Hey, trump promised he would order his AG to appoint a special investigator to look into her situation. It's almost like he lied to get elected.

t1_dthpi7z	0.923100	*	...What?  No, I didn't say any of that. All I said was that there is rampant anti-intellectualism running through republican rhetoric. That's all. 
t1_dt65yva	0.771700	*	>which is pretty damn strict considering most of the country is anti-Trump  That is a stretch...Trump still has a lot of supporters, whether you like him or not.

t1_dt6xcut	-0.502300	*	If 0% is the ideal as the other commenter implied above, why not say that's what you're after and go after it? Besides trying to creep it in so people don't notice? 
t1_dsny2pn	-0.910100	*	My point is physical violence is not a reasonable response to verbal annoyance.  Do you have a point or are you just going to insult me?

t1_dt0jwas	-0.253700	*	Well, there's a conspiracy theory that believes that Yemen government agents were masquerading as the rebels to try and bring the US into the war instead of just sitting on the sidelines
t1_dsxfme1	0.932000	*	Having opposable thumbs is not at all the same thing as being smart. It lets you do cool things, but it is not a measure of intelligence.
t1_dspneyh	-0.859100	*	A whole stock exchange dropping that much is a huge deal when you see it. Usually indicates that there is some very wrong happening at the country level or greater.

t1_dsujz8y	0.000000	*	No one forced the woman to sleep with a man, no one held a gun to her head. Like i said , in special cases (0.01%) is a different question.

t1_dtv4l5y	0.829900	*	And also that, so long as the danger is just to yourself, doing something unsafe shouldn't be illegal.  For instance, it's not illegal to cut your own arm off.
t1_dss1wvq	0.731600	*	Why?   A lot of europeans who can afford to go to the US will go.  They won't go nearly as much as compared to the rest of europe because of distance if anything.
t1_dtnpp2s	0.090000	*	There's a man who has been in jail for years in the UK because he likes to walk around naked... The UK doesn't find that acceptable.  You're hypocrites who think your way is the only way.

t1_dtkxzr2	-0.659700	*	Ah but we can regulate their access to antibiotics. If they go to the black market for it after that... At least it won't be as many people

t1_dsur5el	0.000000	*	You can Wikipedia Haiti to see the ethnic make up. Trump's comments have targeted countries with largely black populations.

t1_dtqtlu1	-0.564700	*	Thats what the regime said. I disagree that homosexuals should be brutally murdered. Being called insane by the likes of you is a badge of honor.
t1_dswe1rh	0.346400	*	The War Department? Dude, either your information is heavily out of date, or you've got a serious bias you need to overcome. It hasn't been called that in 70 years.

t1_dszjiz3	0.128000	*	If the US spent had a humanitarian fleet, that would be great. That fleet would not include 11 supercarriers and thousands of advanced fighter jets.

t1_dsutebu	-0.624900	*	I'm not really involved in the argument you two are apparently having, but I just want to let you know that you're being a bit of a cunt.   You should try to be better in the future.

t1_dsy3uwt	0.318200	*	It's a non sequitur because what you argued and the proof you supplied doesn't have any relevance to each other.

t1_dsm369e	0.967000	*	Printing more money increases inflation which devalues the currency and makes the problem worse. 
t1_dtv85m9	0.421500	*	What left? You had a center-left guy attempting , Sanders. Just look how that went. Except him though , your entire political spectrum is without exception on the right.
t1_dsjxizg	0.000000	*	Oh, sorry. Reading all these comments make me assume the worst in people, ya know?
t1_dt9wpkd	0.401900	*	Fields that require memorizing facts = All of them.  I was gonna write except STEM, but then you HAVE to memorize a lot of stuff to be able to implement it or solve problems so yeah..
t1_dteyxxy	0.000000	*	I know - it was just my joke although if that rule was not there I strongly suspect one of those people would be president today - possible any of them?
t1_dtc7dn1	0.000000	*	Seeking asylum IS NOT the same as Immigration.  You can learn about it here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee

t1_dtbb435	0.025800	*	All you said was soda should be taxed. Don't be prick.
t1_dttbghb	-0.668200	*	I've been hoping Republicans would become non viable, Hillary Democrats would finally admit they are right wingers, and a new progressive party led by a Sanders type would come into existence. 
t1_dssf6eu	0.900100	*	Why dont you read the current article at hand and tell me why China think buying US debt is not so good right now.
t1_dsvm5p8	-0.815600	*	Not to be a butt hole but... Aren't most people throughout history alive during the most technically advanced era in human history from their own perspective?

t1_dtclqw4	0.000000	*	you are assuming a lot.  
t1_dtaqkdk	0.778300	*	MSNBC is nowhere near the opposite end of the spectrum from Fox News. Far right to MAAAAAYYYBE center left is the full breadth of the cable TV spectrum. 
t1_dt21mzc	0.540600	*	Im not sure if youre joking or not. Rich parents arent supposed to help their kids?
t1_dswpgjq	-0.883400	*	Right. People make mistakes, but not ones that should be erased by killing a fetus

t1_dswrisu	0.865800	*	That is the crux of the matter. At that point it becomes a philosophical debate and not a scientific one. And it's a debate I really don't feel like partaking in at the moment.

t1_dt8x3tr	-0.670500	*	Even still, the UK likely has strictly outlined qualifications for hate speech, and I trust a court to not frivolously charge people for such a law
t1_dsptoao	-0.637800	*	The issue here is his normalization of terrorism being part and parcel in any big city.
t1_dtouq7m	0.000000	*	No, just hate idiots like you.

t1_dtn2vhh	-0.493900	*	>Hey man, I don't believe the only proof that's come out about this.  Give me better proof!  You sound like you're unapologetically straight out of T_D.
t1_dtmromh	0.969100	*	As long as you think of climate change as an us vs them instead of humanity trying to better itself, you're doing it wrong.

t1_dt9xm3l	0.544200	*	/s ruins jokes  It dulls the humor for people who get it, and it barely adds anything for those who dont get it.  /s makes you mediocre 
t1_dssn8bs	-0.075300	*	That's a nice thing to tell yourself if it helps you sleep better at night but I don't believe it for a second.
t1_dtmthv0	-0.207500	*	Incredibly. No government so comfortable trampling personal autonomy should be respected or taken seriously.
t1_dt6bkb8	0.000000	*	Yeah and the GOP/Trump can declassify it easily if they want to but apparently it's not *that* important
t1_dsvhoak	-0.381800	*	Obviously. There could be *another* person drowning that they wouldn't see if they left their post. Best to stay there just in case.

t1_dshb42j	0.000000	*	No im a capitalist. Capital leave those who don't deserve/value it to those who do.   Saying businesses have a right to exist is not socialism. 
t1_dsk657n	-0.359700	*	The famine made Ireland a shithole but the people didn't.  Ireland was doing alright before the famine.  Ireland didn't have a drastically worse economy, education system, or government than the US. 
t1_dtgx9ae	0.709300	*	Greece was already in crisis. In a healthy, functioning economy it's not a good thing when the value of your currency falls. Period. Full stop.

t1_dsq6utd	0.254700	*	so are you saying the only way a law can be racist is if it explicitly said black people?
t1_dt2nxm5	-0.718400	*	Well, maybe all those who got hunted by Chinese government also committed crimes, you know, stuff like breaking Chinese laws is frowned upon in China.

t1_dtr7043	0.000000	*	but China is no longer in the 1800s, China was invaded when they were weak, now they are strong, and they can take their property back, the qing dynasty dont exist in a vacuum

t1_dt3hdcd	0.000000	*	I didn't reject anything.  I asked who they are.  I asked what was the definition of religious.  Why won't you answer simple questions?

t1_dtaxtt0	-0.800000	*	In Russia, that's the targeted killing of an opposition politician. In America, that's just a terrible coincidence. Amazing that people can simultaneously hold and sincerely believe both.

t1_dstw1ym	-0.006500	*	i thought it was weird in the first place that 1 was infected without the other being infected too. is it just tapeworms that are the issue?

t1_dsv7a8r	0.000000	*	That's what I hear every person who wants an American green card or visa say. I'd really love to hear an American's opinion on that.

t1_dsh4fko	0.421500	*	Interesting how a comment thread from ten hours ago suddenly got three downvotes. You must be upset. Downvote away dude. If I was here for internet points I'd bury my head in stubborn ignorance.

t1_dstpty3	0.851100	*	Ah, gotcha. Yeah, it is a nice-looking symbol, but I'm sure its absence is to not seem to favor the South's design over the North. If you go bland, there's nothing to offend.

t1_dthomw7	0.000000	*	Man I just couldnt get past the not doing anything because the other half of the time conservatives label him as the president that killed people with drones. Both of these things cant be true.

t1_dsxck7q	0.440400	*	You are ignorant of how anti discrimination laws,  or any laws, work in Canada, but I don't really feel like giving an American a Canadian Law 101
t1_dstq7sz	0.886000	*	It's called Glorious Leaderade in NK. Kim Il Sung invented it, as he was also an accomplished chemist. 
t1_dszmhpg	-0.377400	*	Interesting where your priorities lie.
t1_dsxxl4o	-0.571900	*	Yes, describing an entire continent and countries as a 'shithole' was clearly shorthand for illustrating a point regarding merit based immigration. /s   You are sick. 
t1_dtkpvsp	0.440400	*	Yes, its fairly easy to prove the government didn't collaborate, so I understand it being illegal to day otherwise. The headline would've been a messed up law.
t1_dtcd7m2	0.000000	*	Christ. Why do you say theyre Saudis! like thats some kind of revelation? All it tells people is that you learned everything you know about about 9/11 from a TIL or some shit.

t1_dsv6b4l	-0.453000	*	If you don't believe in God you're not a Christian. You're just pretending to be a Christian to get perks or friends.

t1_dt1bh4c	0.000000	*	It's about how China is using the shutdown to attack the legitimacy of US democracy. i.e., your government sucks.  People in this thread be like no, *your* government sucks.
t1_dsvqzz3	0.361200	*	The part where you said it was anti-American to be selective about who America lets in? I was just presuming you weren't calling yourself anti-American by the way you said it

t1_dsn0ih0	0.273200	*	This isn't really true. Most of our defenses are designed to intercept during mid-course and terminal. I work with those systems. 
t1_dtceeed	0.000000	*	I really do hate myself.

t1_dsjizb1	0.000000	*	That doesn't make him the same as Trump. Wilders is motivated by race, race, race, and anything he sees as directly advancing that cause. Trump is bad on race but also bad on a million other issues.

t1_dsdpfcl	0.743000	*	I think you'll find the rich, the govt and the media were strongly in favour of remaining. Bankers love the EU.
t1_dsq7ciy	-0.275500	*	And what happened to Trump after 8 years shit talking Obama? He became president. Oh yeah, real useless. 
t1_dsytkb6	0.673700	*	Nothing I said is in any way describing anything as black and white. I stated a fact.

t1_dt9ei8w	-0.490600	*	But he's also given the world a head start on understanding and resisting another campaign of the same style.  In a sense, Trump is the hero America deserves.
t1_dtbsy8l	-0.790800	*	Many many more have since died of cancer and various other illnesses caused by the rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts.
t1_dsgq5gn	0.700300	*	Oh no, i understand. I just think leaving them alone and defenseless (by dying) is *more* of a risk (and therefore less rewarding) than having yourself survive to continue looking for food elsewhere. 
t1_dsexv6y	0.440400	*	well that's how it's supposed to work, if you oppose a certain business practice, you can communicate that with your buying power, if enough people do the same, companies notice, and adapt
t1_dtn052o	-0.817600	*	His background has nothing to do with the access to information his position gets him. Attacking his education seems a weird way to show contempt.

t1_dsmu1u5	0.807400	*	> Getting birds in the air is a pretty normal response to something like this though.  except in the case when multiple planes are hijacked and rammed in to buildings.
t1_dto9xy1	0.401900	*	So you are saying that. Thats a lie. Thats literally the main point of the memo.  I read the thing. Lying about whats in it isnt going to work.
t1_dt8veow	0.000000	*	And theyll never accept his tiny hands 
t1_dt67xnd	0.361200	*	Ah, this old talking point.  Are you suggesting the propaganda cyber attacks had no effect? 
t1_dsf0w5s	-0.556300	*	If you want to be clear, dont be sarcastic. Choosing sarcasm and then ruining it for everyone is just a terrible decision.
t1_dsw117i	0.000000	*	If there's 10,000 people and 9,000 jobs then 1,000 people don't have jobs no matter what.   I don't know why anyone wants to argue about math

t1_dsuq9qe	0.985000	*	So I'll ask you, in lieu of OP's dad: Why do you support the president? Lay it out and maybe we can understand each other, because I'm on the other side of the fence.
t1_dt0h285	-0.859100	*	Actually there is an advantage. Depending on the prison itself and the justice system and corruption, they have a chance to escape and do it again.   The death sentence gets rid of that chance.
t1_dtwn91q	0.875000	*	without hunters we don't need to have reserves and lions are free to roam.  The only reason why there are reserves is to protect lions from hunters.  
t1_dt2igl7	0.000000	*	Well, what I'm saying is that he's completely right that US politics is unrelated. Everybody is acting like he's wrong.

t1_dsrp2kk	0.000000	*	Yea we should fire them all
t1_dslid42	0.595600	*	No, I'm not. The parent comment advocates pardoning everyone involved. There's a reason they aren't going to just pardon everyone: some people involved should have been in jail.
t1_dttt1lt	0.939800	*	To turn your last point on its head. If we are not around to experience life after our death, does it matter whether it exists?
t1_dsn12xb	0.401900	*	Are you a vegetarian, then? 
t1_dsp7prj	-0.693100	*	Same applies to the U.S. Which isn't a rich country either and spends all its money on 'stupidly' military expansions.
t1_dt3blsh	-0.401900	*	I don't claim to know things that are not evidently true.  Christians do it and call it faith.
t1_dtoyumz	0.000000	*	Though that didn't exist back then, that is the case however.
t1_dtrj22o	0.525500	*	Yeah but it's not a 100% reliable and you have to constantly double-check what you say. You can't be yourself when your family members are on your friend's list. 
t1_dtddayc	0.000000	*	But for the low low price of 2 nuclear warheads, you can show him that you actually were serious this whole time. 
t1_dswafiz	0.988300	*	I figured I would answer your bullshit strawman with another. If you don't like it maybe worldnews where everything is posted in a sad attempt to attack Trump is not for you. 
t1_dsfm8ag	-0.318200	*	Why do you think they make these big shows of aggression every couple of years?
t1_dt4zthp	-0.440400	*	Im sort of facilitating that, I make software robot's that replace white collar workers.
t1_dsmscbx	0.000000	*	Tell that to all the states who take more money from the feds than they put in.  California pays for West Virginia to exist.
t1_dtro6uu	-0.651000	*	Yep.  Same parents that told us dont believe everything you see on tv believe literally every single thing on Facebook.  
t1_dtczudm	0.071600	*	Well, he sounds just lovely. I'm sorry you live next to that shit show.
t1_dswnrv6	-0.822300	*	Care to present a single political position you hold that isn't ultimately based on a feeling or belief?  Seriously, just one. I've never come across one, I'd be interested to see what it looks like.
t1_dsl03c5	0.542300	*	Tonight on FOX: TRAITOR(!) refuses to follow President's Order to launch a preemptive nuclear strike. Possible Hillary Clinton connections? We'll discuss after these messages.  
t1_dt5tama	0.000000	*	I'd genuinely prefer an uninvolved, neutral third party to analyse the texts and tell me the same thing. A party with an open regarding its funding.

t1_dsddyd6	0.085700	*	I thought Trump people mostly thought the new Star Wars was SJW propoganda.
t1_dtjibp2	0.000000	*	No but the dekerintinzation of the penis head will revitalize the nerves that have been diminished by dead dry skin built up
t1_dt5rnin	0.297800	*	Maybe you need to look up what a shill is. It's OK if you delete your comment after.
t1_dsfry4v	-0.318200	*	Just another cog in the cold war era propaganda machine, eh
t1_dttcwhf	0.763600	*	But, I guess, not for cancer, or for degenerative neurological disease, leaving you in wheelchair, requiring constant care? What was your plan if end up needing heart transplant?
t1_dsp9c6w	-0.765000	*	This is basically the event that kicks off the book The Road. We don't want to live in a The Road world.
t1_dsou10s	0.000000	*	Let me know. Id be very interested in reading more. 
t1_dsg9jap	0.000000	*	Is it really hard to believe I outlasted a manager in a job? If you ever worked in the restaurant business youd know this isnt exactly something thats hard to do.
t1_dslvhwj	-0.549900	*	That's a different thing. That's someone being pushy and ignorant. 
t1_dt9x7g8	-0.381800	*	Just do it back. Be a fun person, not a negative one
t1_dsqsc6f	-0.025800	*	There is none. That is my point.

t1_dsk4b2y	-0.712600	*	Oh, because Nazis are delicate snowflakes and we can't call them out because otherwise they'll just hate us more.
t1_dt62f3z	0.000000	*	I dont remember implying that the Netherlands belong to most.
t1_dt2kk2b	-0.008300	*	Do you think that explanation applies to Egyptian mythology as well? 
t1_dsjit2f	0.440400	*	Lol if you think that.
t1_dstdf4u	0.025800	*	No, we're not. You specifically mentioned the fuck your feelings crowd as a direct attribution to why these teenagers hacked to death a homeless person.
t1_dstzdi2	-0.571900	*	Lol! You don't see the irony in that statement? As you fellatio the biggest lying president in the history of presidents.  But hey, enjoy that ~~wall~~ ~~fence~~ 2 extra boarder control guards.
t1_dtsqpj9	-0.971900	*	That's why its for the courts to decide how much was a joke ? and not the internet? hence he's not been convicted... 
t1_dsgcjsu	-0.726900	*	Ok, it just seems to contradict what you said first.
t1_dsvr8tf	0.318200	*	It's called a logarithmic scale.  It's used because economists care more about percentage change than absolute.  TYL.  Keep embarrassing yourself.  LOL
t1_dta0l3u	0.507300	*	Come on! Zoos don't count?
t1_dt6dttu	-0.865800	*	> When the US stopped torturing bad guys were you  1. You have no idea if they actually were bad guys, there never were any trials.  2. You never stopped.
t1_dsuv61a	-0.493900	*	Any time. The problem is when you express a desire to not let those people come here. 
t1_dstnl12	0.401900	*	Again, do you really believe the world thinks that the archetype American is blonde and blue-eyed?
t1_dssuxaa	0.361200	*	Can I get a description? Don't want to watch it and too afraid to search it.  
t1_dsh57m9	-0.778300	*	What would a dead person even be treated to? Brains?

t1_dswpg2r	-0.202300	*	That, my friend, is a straw man.
t1_dtnqk9j	0.595000	*	Maybe. But this falls pretty clearly into the oppression category. 
t1_dsjvs5w	-0.267200	*	no go is a pretty staight forward phrase that is meant to be literally interpreted. Its not no live for extended periods of time while drinking the municipal water.
t1_dtnepby	-0.624900	*	> If you stole my house I'd push you into the sea 100%.  Join Hamas.
t1_dt850fn	-0.202300	*	good that you finally learned. Also people should stop taking injections as the needle hurts!
t1_dsslnik	-0.654200	*	That's a weird time traveling strawman.
t1_dteo0yk	0.440400	*	Maybe if we eat 100% all food we produce, instead of throwing out 40% of it because this apple is not perfectly round and that banana is slightly off coloured, we'll be fine too.    So many options!
t1_dtdtd1k	0.000000	*	And more accurate to the book. Book ending is still the best through 
t1_dskqllk	0.000000	*	You know, you **can** distrust someone who is obviously a crook. Hillary clearly has skeletons in her closet, and if nothing else is a complete bitch. 
t1_dslklre	0.625900	*	Don't know that one.
t1_dt7eu9w	-0.128000	*	I would rather subsidize other citizens directly instead of helping Walmart deliver money to investors and running local retailers paying a living wage out of business. But what do I know?
t1_dsuy41m	-0.381800	*	Where's your sources? KMT commited the most soldiers in the war, and won the decisive battles themselves. You can even argue the Soviet Union or even the British helped the KMT more than the USA
t1_dt5e3sc	-0.455900	*	Uh oh. Don't give those Americans any funny ideas...
t1_dsdhse1	0.000000	*	Thats why theres a squad part to firing squad...
t1_dt3zhal	-0.265600	*	Why dont you? Oh right, because youd get run over by a tank... Meanwhile Americans continue to set historic records in protesting their government and passing new laws of reform. 
t1_dtfqyzv	0.695600	*	I'm sure the benefits were nice, but the cost of living in the DMV area is ridiculous. 
t1_dtejj4o	0.000000	*	I can't see why reducing meat, increasing renewable energy production, and reducing & recycling are impossible. Difficult, but definitely reasonable.

t1_dsrihjf	-0.866500	*	Honest question  what does memeing mean in the context you used it?  Trying to be funny? Being lazy? Using a cliche?  Seems less harsh than calling someone an idiot, like theyre just being silly. 
t1_dslb5sb	0.000000	*	Nope! Walked it after I decided I hated my job.
t1_dswodhf	0.848100	*	I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not but it will be a cold day in hell before it will come around again and it's not an error so I have no worries at all about it.

t1_dsnnqfo	0.444200	*	Source?
t1_dtczhj4	0.889800	*	Its certainly better for business AND for money to support science and innovation. This anti-intelligence crusade their party is on will cripple the us economy if it wins out.

t1_dsv5jvr	-0.647600	*	It makes someone racist to point out race? Maybe if you have a surface level understanding  of what racism actually is. 
t1_dtjx84v	0.735100	*	And because you say it's wrong it is? Who decides what's wrong?
t1_dt1eanm	0.000000	*	So you've never heard of tiananmen square? Lmao
t1_dsmgh0c	-0.864900	*	No, you gotta dig into that. Trump has HUGE mommy issues. The last video interview of her is very telling.   And both of his parents were in the Klan.
t1_dskq3dm	-0.077200	*	Your reading comprehension could use some work.
t1_dta1d5z	-0.865900	*	That's pretty normal, imagine if police would enforce every tiny traffic law... It's not practical and that's why these laws only get enforced in the extreme cases. 
t1_dsjxb8m	-0.072400	*	At that speed you could just shoot it with a machine gun though.  A very basic radar guided anti air gun would shred these things.
t1_dttdvay	-0.571900	*	Aren't you referring to junior doctors with no experience though. Iv seen doctors drive very nice cars.
t1_dtt9qab	0.000000	*	And how many of that 20% are allowed to vote in Israel?

t1_dthanyz	0.357000	*	Depends. Do you own a lot of land? Why should people who own 10% of the land have 90% of the say over the laws governing those lands?
t1_dsgih5k	0.000000	*	How did monopoly somehow develop these 'house rules' when the instructions literally came with the game?  And how come these house rules are consistent across america?
t1_dtby0n3	0.592700	*	Well, not every German was a Nazi.
t1_dtn73qp	0.223500	*	This may surprise you, but I've got complaints about food production as well. I need food to live though, so it's a little more like the polio vaccine if you want to draw that comparison
t1_dsgj149	0.000000	*	It was the government who bailed them out with the expense of tax payers money and allowed the banks to give bonuses to the people who caused the crisis. It was not capitalism.

t1_dswl3wo	-0.051600	*	Probably not the best example, many of those voters do actually live in multi-cultural neighborhoods in cities and outlying burbs.
t1_dtvv5rv	-0.868100	*	Nope he had it right. No one is saying that the lives of children don't matter. People just don't like false equivalencies that are intended to be inflammatory. 
t1_dsqasxi	-0.690000	*	How many pencils does a 14-year-old need in a school full of computers?  A gross?
t1_dtgpg9q	0.250000	*	> Corporate media comedians   Well fuck, I'm out.
t1_dt5qmvs	0.000000	*	So as argument, you've accused one person of mental illness and one person of excessive drinking, all without addressing any actual points. You're terrible at this. Who taught you how to debate?

t1_dshsao2	0.369100	*	Yes, but what hes saying is that right to work is another example of a phrase thats meant to sound like a good thing but actually screws over workers.

t1_dsgiwzo	0.000000	*	Garfield
t1_dt96sbj	0.025800	*	It's different. As you said earlier (I think it was you), they are not equal. Removing the clit isn't the same as removing foreskin.
t1_dt2k4nd	-0.700300	*	Dont forget & me cuz you know, ASSuME 
t1_dt2njca	0.493900	*	Depends on your family.  In some families unfriending another family member can and does cause fights/anger and drama.  Not everyone has a functional family.

t1_dtfhnmj	0.936100	*	No. Not really. US is basically on biblical law. Which is why anti gay anti abortion etc sentiment

t1_dsfhlcl	0.069000	*	You truly are a gullible and illiterate moron. Even liberal economists disagree. 
t1_dsltu1n	0.571900	*	'maybe' muslims burned dutch politicians.  Doesn't make it any less ridiculous.
t1_dsmzp67	0.765000	*	Free is not a metric of capitalism.

t1_dt9yt54	-0.958300	*	I already stated both are despicable.  Of course the Israeli government kill more, they vastly outnumber and outgunned their opposition. 
t1_dsx43fe	0.000000	*	Dude.. your math does not add up. 
t1_dt692nr	0.490200	*	Well FEMA distributed over a billion dollars of housing assistance on the island, so I guess youre wrong.

t1_dt6z3uw	0.848100	*	One of these companies makes the device that you are probably using right now.
t1_dtsiwxt	0.031000	*	Op-eds aren't proof of anything. All we can do is wait and see.

t1_dtvlc6t	-0.897300	*	Agree, just as every country has benefited from industrialization and the US doesnt owe other countries some sort of reparations.  
t1_dt1nj7g	-0.542300	*	As far as the Constitution was concerned, there was no debate about women voting, either. Do you think they should have compromised?

t1_dsmp899	0.544800	*	But what do you want Switzerland to do about your problems?  They even missed out on the last 2 world wars, they don't give a fuck if you guys blow each other up yet again.
t1_dsp4ebz	-0.549900	*	Have PAK FA and Kalibr been performing poorly in Syria? I didn't even think the fighter was in production.
t1_dtn86ym	-0.494800	*	Even if I grant you that, they also have a shit ton of money invested in the US via real estate and other ventures, that 18% is only the tip of how important a healthy US economy is to Chinas. 
t1_dtexe64	-0.099700	*	We were able to hurt them because we legalized alcohol. If prohibition of alcohol remained, we wouldn't have been able to hurt them in the latter half of the 20th century.

t1_dsut94h	-0.153100	*	Considering theres a vocal group of Republicans who disapprove of Trump, it really does. I mean, unless you keep yourself in an echo chamber.

t1_dsmcbui	0.000000	*	As someone whos been to Haiti (military aid), I wouldnt even want to be a dictator there. That place is beyond shitty. Id rather go back to Afghanistan than live in Haiti.

t1_dtmbadh	0.000000	*	Oh, good to know. I thought saliva tests had the same 1-2 month time as urinal tests. Can those be bought for personal use?
t1_dtiknna	0.585900	*	I want him to be sentenced to community service for life.  I want to see his fat ass in a reflective vest on the shoulder of Cross Island Parkway, picking up garbage every morning on my way to work. 
t1_dtablfs	0.581500	*	No, it's a simplification. But what do you think would happen if the law stops working for people? That they'll do nothing? Or that they'll settle for saying pretty please? 
t1_dtn052o	0.000000	*	His background has nothing to do with the access to information his position gets him. Attacking his education seems a weird way to show contempt.

t1_dsp49j0	-0.571900	*	Maybe they get their numbers from Tesla's truck division. 
t1_dsvp5y1	-0.687200	*	It is. Im telling you why we let them stay here instead of sending them back. Its our bleeding hearts. Most of us suffer from them being here and arent benefiting from their cheap labor. 
t1_dtnd2f7	0.734500	*	Every post you make is in the reddit echo chambers. Granted you seem to stick to the more delusional areas, but your weak concern-troll is obvious. 
t1_dsjrdct	-0.624900	*	I stand by it. Just love to see that liberals downvoted an anti Trump post. 
t1_dtupg2g	0.381800	*	You guys using the word we to refer to space x but not for NASA is confusing the shit out of me. 
t1_dsr32yp	0.000000	*	The problem is that the visual inspection doesnt solve this.  I can reflash my ecu to bypass all smog controls then just flash it back before testing and they wouldnt know.

t1_dsf4v9k	0.261700	*	Probably the one discussing managers booing each other, if they don't bring the ratio of white men under them down to particular quotas.  That would be the strongest in my mind.

t1_dsq9m23	0.743000	*	I just came across this. I love how this guy breaks things down.  Take a look if you're interested.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67B8-yHqum4
t1_dsnzjst	0.000000	*	You can say my comment is irrelevant, because you dont like it.  I didn't go around calling people autistic because I don't like their opinion though.
t1_dta5m80	0.081300	*	Ok, so at what point do you put up a fuss? What if it was your shoes? They look funny in the x-ray, they gotta go.. you're cool? Just get in line, look down, and keep moving?

t1_dsrvwpj	0.000000	*	You could say this, almost word for word, about white 'christian' terrorists in Anglo America. 
t1_dsrscph	-0.792900	*	Must have been the same class where they taught us that Poland deserved it in 1939.
t1_dt3u36m	0.610000	*	Speaking of qualifications, the dea still thinks Marijuana does not have any medicinal value. Would you say that is analogous to hiring a middle school drop out to teach physics at MIT?
t1_dttss68	-0.981700	*	God or no God, a ny species after  human extinction won't be  barbaric unless it is a tool-making intelligent form like us.

t1_dszrdet	0.362600	*	Then we can agree to disagree. Legislation reflects society, it doesn't shape it. If you don't accept that, then we are working from different premises.

t1_dtddj3j	-0.493900	*	global warming is alarmist bullshit in the first place. The U.S. should just keep doing what it is doing to maintain its position on the global playing field. Anything else would just be stupid.
t1_dtqbj2j	-0.296000	*	Do you really not understand how that's way different than claiming that Jews have too much control over the US government?
t1_dsrtv16	0.615900	*	Glad your conscience is okay with dictatorships. So long as they only torture, starve, rape and kill their own right?

t1_dsork28	0.556300	*	You have a quote there: Charity, lots of it, and in public and yet such a quote exists nowhere on the internet except in this thread. Do you have a source for that? Or for anything else you said?

t1_dska18y	0.807400	*	My bad I assumed you were an American and we all know what happens when you assume. Seem as you are Canadian can we still do a swap? 
t1_dtrnepn	0.401900	*	Depends on the ISP. Mine stays the same as long as my cable modem doesn't reboot. At one point I had the same IP for over a year.

t1_dto48jl	0.865800	*	> I want to do everything I can to make sure Trump and his accomplices in Congress get everything that's coming to them.  4 more years?
t1_dszmq39	0.000000	*	You can't associate the US to anything, you can associate regions of America to something but never the entire country.

t1_dtbwvuc	0.428400	*	>They deny being Brexiteers, knowing it is indefensible  Incorrect. I don't deny it to anyone who asks, and I can defend my position just fine.

t1_dts0c5w	0.451500	*	Mainland cities developed under one party rule, they haven't hit challenges that seem like it takes democracy to solve. Vice versa for Hong Kong. Status quo is a powerful thing. 
t1_dtafk5c	0.000000	*	Just put the poo on the blockchain like Tether claims to do with USD. And just like with Tethers you don't even have to have the poo as long as people believe you have it.  https://tether.to/

t1_dt7h5bu	0.000000	*	To be honest, I didn't expect you to look at evidence. You're acting childishly contrarian here, and we both know why.
t1_dtnezj9	-0.899000	*	We are cowards.   We'd rather have what is bad and familiar than what is potentially great but unknown. 
t1_dsl6s7f	0.128000	*	What does that even mean? nobody made that argument. 
t1_dshyfy4	0.542300	*	Nah, theyll still need the masses to buy the shit they peddle.

t1_dswnd4m	0.964300	*	Not only that. But if you have to ask about him being a sociopath, you either have no clue what Harper was or perhaps you're a conservative and he was a hero to you.
t1_dt8m125	0.318200	*	> Famously because they were demanding land that would put the entire country at risk for rocket attacks  I mean Israel could just relocate to Eastern Germany. That'll make everyone happy.

t1_dshtx6m	-0.385100	*	If you think that it's only about shaming countries, you're missing the point. The point is how can we and our allies protect against these sorts of attacks in the future.
t1_dt8uys1	0.599400	*	Yeah, the uptight twit routine really doesn't help your case.
t1_dso56wq	0.273200	*	Kind of feel like the US is the bigger threat here when it comes to this sort of thing.
t1_dta0r5u	-0.230200	*	I mean... Trump kinda is a racist and far right for sure. A Nazi? No (yet at least) 
t1_dsetmmt	0.128000	*	What backbone issue have you identified? As far as I'm aware, he's been pretty firm with his views on important topics (religious right involvement in politics for example)
t1_dt2llol	-0.523300	*	Nope, I saw that, but we`re talking about the 33% in america, which is *considered* to be in the developed world, so adding that into the quote is completely redundant.  
t1_dtoojzz	-0.401900	*	I'm not justifying them, I just wanted to point out that the real problem isn't immigration, but other

t1_dtnc2so	0.000000	*	Neutral doesn't mean correct. The explanation he gave was a bad one so I'm presenting the argument against it.
t1_dsgzlqc	0.735100	*	Sure, but Sessions won his last race with 99% of the vote. My point is even in as red as it gets Alabama, a Democrat was still able to eek out a win. 
t1_dsldooc	0.000000	*	Then who are these tens if not hundreds of thousands of people?
t1_dsd9dko	-0.296000	*	Huh, that's actually a bit of a surprise to me. But I guess it makes sense.

t1_dseudwr	-0.102700	*	310 lbs at 6 feet isn't very much by American standards, sadly.  240 lbs even less so.
t1_dtn9byi	0.000000	*	It's pretty clear he isn't a bot though. I mean you have tinfoil in your name so you must be a crazy conspiracy theorist right?

t1_dt9glzd	0.862200	*	Yet, all those people voted for him. I wonder what he would have to do for them not to vote for him. How can someone who didn't pay the working man, possibly represent the working man?
t1_dt04f6l	0.664800	*	Thats not the problem. The problem is poorly designed security measures and lack of education
t1_dt5wsff	0.000000	*	That place is mostly satire.  Everyone posting there knows he's not Clark Kent.  It's just fun to pretend.
t1_dtbmx87	-0.077200	*	Never mentioned Republicans once. You brought up Republicans. You also brought up Democrats and tried to deflect to Democrats.

t1_dt5wymm	-0.436400	*	Trump is a fooking moron, a con artist, and Putin's useful idiot.   General Mattis is probably motivated by a desire to minimize the damage caused by the Russian Puppet Trump.

t1_dsrvmv4	0.608600	*	Porn. It's the only thing Bing is good for. Basically Google filters so much shit out, even if you have safe search turned off. Bing doesn't do that though.
t1_dse3us3	0.000000	*	Communists advocate for the abolition of structures which facilitate and feed greed and corruption.  In a society where greed and corruption are meaningless, they don't matter!

t1_dsqa9bd	-0.440400	*	Your argument sounds like butthurt.

t1_dt8ri6h	-0.931000	*	Making fun of? Whatever you call a bunch of mra 4chins blurting shit about not being responsible for slavery or whatever. Yeah, I am a huge sjw joke.
t1_dt0mic3	-0.468500	*	All of what you say is true, but illegal immigrants do exist and work in the USA.  Making anything illegal doesn't mean it will cease to exist.

t1_dtgqh8z	-0.413700	*	Are we currently committing genocide? Is our current foreign policy resulting in a world war? Is the government sponsoring mass killings of our own citizens? Using gas?
t1_dssiu7j	-0.296000	*	The whole point of Christianity is that Jesus was born, and that there's a New Testament. Why are you talking about the Old Testament?
t1_dsmptnm	0.000000	*	holy shit, I never said it was acceptable, but you're an idiot if you think FGM is the same. It just isn't. It doesn't affect you reproductively, sexually, or lead to lifelong complications.

t1_dtd1hu6	0.611500	*	No you just don't understand that your political opinion is only an opinion, because you're naive to yourself and your snake charmer.
t1_dskd8f3	0.440400	*	No, everyone has a right to a healthy life. That means they can live like that if they wish. If they don't, society is not responsible for their poor productivity and lack of effort.

t1_dtucqii	0.000000	*	A short follow up. Actually, the plane shot in 2001 is relevant to the story as the Ukrainian military have a record of DENYING shooting down a passenger plane. Didnt they?
t1_dt8paj7	0.296000	*	Yes, that's why I don't. Thus my more realistic number of 30-60k  elsewhere.

t1_dsij4qw	0.526700	*	I prefer neither. End of story.
t1_dtn2zta	0.781400	*	I don't see how that contradicts my post, I agree with you. I just wasn't informed enough to discuss ISIS' twitter.
t1_dtvcpwk	-0.296000	*	what I meant was any given area an animal is confined to while it's being shot at. like the area might be that big, but do they put a lion in a smaller confined area when its number is up?

t1_dsy4qh7	0.421500	*	They still need to get to Russia dude
t1_dsnhcxt	-0.752400	*	Whatever, semantics... both arent acceptable. Surely the greatest country on Earth can produce better quality leadership?

t1_dthahm0	-0.771700	*	Oh, I agree, the idea that anyone is better dead is laughable if they're not there to make the decision. It's hard for death to be an improvement, unless it is willingly chosen.

t1_dt9yfhf	-0.361200	*	Nobody has ever said that, but it's the mental gymnastics they have to do in order to believe drones are a cause of civilian casualties and not any weapon in foreign wars in general.

t1_dtvgi1h	-0.771700	*	I'm saying that perhaps it can work in the short-term, but our longer-term efforts should not be reliant on encouraging extremely unsavoury behaviour. This has nothing to do with 'people with money'.

t1_dsm98o2	0.599400	*	I mean its one consideration for sure, but i think necessity should also play a role.  If its purely aesthetics as to why you boil the Lobster alive, then perhaps maybe we should kill it first.

t1_dthchbt	-0.893600	*	He did recuse his duties until he was cleared and so now hes back to business. The irony in your comment about conspiracy theories in a thread on Russia-related conspiracy is just too much to handle.

t1_dsguu5o	0.510600	*	Lol this is supply demand, and no we obviously believe different labor has different values. Commies are the ones who think even if that's the case it shouldn't matter. 
t1_dsh58c1	0.000000	*	That doesn't disregard the financial start up cost.
t1_dsgiako	0.102700	*	at least that's what she claims.  I can't seem to find any information corroborating the story.  I'm sure she'd be 100% truthful though. I can't imagine any reason to lie about something like that.

t1_dsh4jem	-0.594000	*	Fun fact, humans are one of the only animals that regularly choke. Most others can eat and breathe at the same time. We're fucked due to the development of our larynx that allows us to speak.

t1_dt9xawe	0.000000	*	Exactly. Tons of philosophy people go into coding type careers. I suppose it undermines their worldview if lowly liberal arts people can get well-respected STEM jobs, though
t1_dt8u04g	0.432900	*	When the media gets caught routinely making up stories for ratings, its hard to take them even slightly serious. I prefer to get my information from independent content creators.

t1_dtgm4hl	0.526700	*	Then how can you possibly have possibly been kicked out of the country? It wouldn't have gone through court if you were a citizen or had an in date visa so what reason did they use to kick you out?

t1_dsi4apf	0.757900	*	Reminding people to vote him out is really just a safety measure at this point.  We're all just waiting on our boy The Mueller to take out the trash.

t1_dtq3whv	0.690100	*	I mean I'm more in the boat of sexuality being fluid and society has made it concrete for many people. Less hormones more environmental control.

t1_dsl3mq7	0.567800	*	Dont bother arguing with this guy. It is someone else's alt account or a troll/bot.  Trump's behavior equates to treason by his definition but I am sure he will try and defend Trump anyways. 
t1_dsj9y4u	0.612400	*	If every Democrat in red states voted, I guarantee you Hillary would have won by far.. Individual votes almost never matter anywhere - it is the pool of people that matter...

t1_dttuuyg	-0.888300	*	Mmm no what Russia did was wrong which is why they are under rather heavy sanctions. It's appearently only ok if Israel does it (according only to Trumps USA, not the rest of the world)

t1_dsjkxbc	-0.296000	*	H1b has definite abuse, I agree.   But generally speaking, I don't think we take illiberal shitty people as Trumps shithole country comments suggest.

t1_dtcl9rn	0.476700	*	>The subpoena only covered work related emails, not private emails.  If it was Joe Blow, he wouldn't get the opportunity to have his lawyers to decide what is personal and what is work related.

t1_dtnruf5	0.211500	*	I'm talking about before Trump took office. It's too late if you wait til after he's taken office. You've now got Russian spies in the White House running the show. 
t1_dtmqbp8	0.000000	*	That's an awful lot of work to read some random webpage. If this is real news, the NYT et al will run the story later.
t1_dsvt6ct	0.510600	*	err...something more solid than It's true because I think it's true based on my own opinions
t1_dtbrkxw	-0.907600	*	The problem is that it's ultimately a cheaper system for you than the one we have currently. So annoyed feelings at morons aside, the most prudent financial choice is typically universal healthcare. 
t1_dtozl5a	0.000000	*	Then why ignore my point?
t1_dtafs6r	0.713600	*	Yeah, reading that article, I was actually with her up until the haircut remark and the refusal to let the deodorant go.

t1_dskkpg4	0.584900	*	Except under your thinking, people from Saudi Arabia would be banned as they have funded terrorism. Oh wait, Trump has business links with the Saudis? Of course they're exempt, no terrorism there!
t1_dsizecj	-0.476700	*	whatever, targeting != collateral
t1_dstv1kj	-0.828800	*	No, the police simply said the attack didn't happen. The part where you're assuming this was a grand evil conspiracy by an 11-year-old is where the crazy comes in.

t1_dthahm0	0.726900	*	Oh, I agree, the idea that anyone is better dead is laughable if they're not there to make the decision. It's hard for death to be an improvement, unless it is willingly chosen.

t1_dtqghuf	0.250000	*	Buddy, prohibition ended a century ago. Calling 3 beers a night alcoholism is near Volstead act levels of pearl clutching.  
t1_dtnheyi	0.294800	*	They had to let them into the US for that? And after the meeting they're like, enjoy your stay, maybe check out some national monuments or tour the White House while you're here.?

t1_dt2osej	-0.168000	*	Most Israeli PMs go down for some combination of those things because of how Israeli laws work. But yeah, it seems a little sketchy overall despite it being the best offer.
t1_dsgowh0	-0.947200	*	Weird how it's always Muslims throwing gays off of buildings and stoning adulterers though, huh? Buddhists need to up their game.

t1_dt0lac7	0.845100	*	I know and that's why an excessive amount of regulation backfires.  Better keep regulations to an absolute essential minimum.

t1_dsmqby6	0.000000	*	They said they do not recall him saying it. Vastly different from him saying he did not say it.

t1_dtjjr9q	0.680800	*	Sure but when you don't scrub everywhere and do it regularly, it can be dangerous. Better to get rid of the foreskin so you don't get to deal with that shit.

t1_dt0ot9t	0.128000	*	More like since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, when the British and French deliberately divided up the land in such a way as to force tension. It was more or less fine before that.

t1_dtb1qn1	0.452300	*	Grouping everyone who uses that subreddit a scumbag is way too much of a generalism 
t1_dtedxty	-0.510600	*	Obviously. It's a communist state where the government controls everything. A large part of the population is still uneducated and dirt poor. Hard to pollute when you're more focused on not-dying.
t1_dsgbxgi	0.290500	*	If they're anti-Clinton and sort of anti-Trump, that pretty much leaved Bernie. 
t1_dtua2dr	0.077200	*	polish government was in exile and the country was nazi occupied. so should be called nazi death camp. i would think less than .00001% of poles gave up jews.

t1_dtah3d5	-0.557400	*	He doesn't seem scared to me.  A scared man doesn't arrest the most powerful people in the country and hold them ransome for every penny of their wealth.  He feels secure.  And why wouldn't he?
t1_dt974ur	0.000000	*	Sure, could we use the same logic for why there are more male employees at Apple and Google?  Men and women college graduation rates are the same.  Maybe the men are just smarter?

t1_dshc1n8	0.887300	*	I worked for that company for a long time and know a lot of people both in stores and higher up. They are pretty much printing money at this point to be honest.
t1_dt5ycbp	-0.102700	*	Why? Why would you feel the need to disrespect their customs. Some reporters opinion doesn't matter in the grand scheme of the US's political ties to Israel.

t1_dtvy94r	0.229200	*	No... They aren't slaves. Please consult a dictionary. And yes, the country was founded on slavery. No one disagreed with that. He said it still is currently. Which is absurd. 
t1_dt68fn0	0.361200	*	It doesn't. The policy has never been challenged and there hasn't really been a need to challenge it, so it's just the going policy. In theory, a party with standing could challenge it. 
t1_dt9xz3y	0.000000	*	I enjoy your Sience

t1_dshvzr9	0.190100	*	I was a manager for 10 years at a pizza place.  Did your drivers shake the 2 liters of the non tippers too in addition to always delivering them last if there was more than one order ready at a time?

t1_dt6mmuf	0.000000	*	Difference between anarchism's dictionary and philosophical definitions. The philosophy is very different from the what you see in the dictionary.
t1_dshs2yj	-0.296000	*	> Using whataboutism to justify anything is ridiculous.  My point exactly.
t1_dstqhhm	0.000000	*	So you cherry pick what you like in the article and dismiss what you dont like in it. I dont know who you think youre going to convince here with that line of reasoning.

t1_dte1hmj	-0.843900	*	That's 90% approval from a very biased poll. There are polls out there that say the same thing about Trump.

t1_dtso60k	0.680100	*	Post sources for your gish-gallop or begone, Troll. Your first bullet-point is blatantly wrong, as the 1947 Partition Plan was refused by the Arabs and has no legal validity.
t1_dslh3kb	0.458800	*	Yep let it go.  This country probably doesn't need to be a leading superpower if we can't get our own shit together.  We need to drop a few pegs.

t1_dtj0txj	-0.817600	*	That's kind of fucked up. I can see why youd prioritize families over single people... but not women over men.. or single mothers over single fathers.
t1_dtb03mi	-0.102700	*	Wow. I'm literate so this isn't an issue for me but I have never heard of using 'our' instead.   Neat.

t1_dswlkfq	-0.115100	*	The Supreme Court in morgantaler explicitly stated that there is no substantive right to an abortion under s7.  So where else are you going to find it?
t1_dtvhkla	-0.807400	*	> Is that a fair statement?  Yes, it is.  Belonging to an ethnicity or religion is neither positive nor negative, it is neutral.
t1_dt1v6fy	-0.410500	*	Good thing the poor are to lazy to revolt.  Maybe a riot now and then.  But s full revolution sounds too much like work

t1_dt7zl5z	-0.970500	*	No it's perversion and a monstrocity which hurts millions of children worldwide. Pedo apologists are standing on the grave of all the murdered children by child abusers.

t1_dshipxf	-0.950900	*	Okay you're right. Iraq did it, but a government 10x worse than Iraq led by a guy that how fed his uncle to dogs wouldn't dare do such a thing. -__-
t1_dsjvfyk	0.493900	*	Jesus, theres a lot of triggered Trump fanboys on reddit tonight. You guys getting longer hours in Moscow?
t1_dswm5n0	-0.933600	*	Except for the ones that aren't. Leaving open legal grounds to force someone to carry their rapist's child to term is far more horrific, imo.
t1_dsuscq6	0.340000	*	I remember reading his business applied but what legislation increased the cap? 
t1_dtrmzj4	0.000000	*	If we are doing things right, we probably want to shift to base 12 :P
t1_dswpnj9	-0.648600	*	You won't get a response. It simply doesn't compute in this thread. There are tons of prolife people who have no problem with social services.
t1_dtaat3b	0.446600	*	Just out of curiosity, what happens if you call a cop a fucking asshole in the US?
t1_dsn0jsv	0.000000	*	The entire world is but a press of a button and less than an hour away from total irreversible annihilation.  Sleep well!

t1_dtmk452	0.672000	*	That's nice I wouldn't mind see the verified outlets and seeing if it's verified or just citing one article who's citing the same unnamed sources.  It seems to go that way alot 
t1_dto2jrz	-0.102700	*	Just curious when do you think the US will pay that back?   /s
t1_dsda79g	0.919000	*	House prices fell down 10-20ish percent because houses were still usable and useful. There is nothing backing up bitcoins. Bitcoins have potential to drop down to zero.
t1_dtxsoxl	-0.842700	*	It takes two to tango, mate.  Eta:  oh that poor woman...shes such a victim of the big bad politician taking advantage.  *rolls eyes*
t1_dsnwwrs	-0.243100	*	They target israeli military whenever they can. The casualties received by Israel during recent incursions prove that.
t1_dtvez9g	0.000000	*	I will admit that I don't know much about the process of cows becoming meat prior to the slaughterhouse.  
t1_dtmyj9u	-0.286000	*	Uh huh.  Innocent people don't lie to the FBI and Flynn like the rest are far from innocent.
t1_dsxnakd	0.000000	*	Wait, are you saying sea, meaning the ocean, or si, meaning, yes, Spain?
t1_dsj668j	-0.202300	*	After Vietnam, it took a while for a military action of any kind to be popular.  It would take an invasion on our shores to get the American public behind a military action.
t1_dt013qr	0.000000	*	Yay story time 
t1_dt745o5	0.000000	*	There are thousands of other fake news stories about how Hillary was investigated by the fbi and found not to have violated any laws. So don't pretend that was all the fake news.
t1_dtpxz4e	0.000000	*	I distinctly remember a meme about a girl crying over allegedly gay swans, which is what I was trying to mash up with the gay frogs. I took a shot.  What's the dove thing?
t1_dtv9zh9	0.144600	*	How is that in any way good for Trump?
t1_dt7av25	0.000000	*	Directed by Dennis Rodman.
t1_dtmr8hq	-0.077200	*	what subs are you used to where this level of discourse isn't downvoted?
t1_dt80jev	0.102700	*	isn't the waste minimal in nuclear? also I was pretty certain nuclear power plants nowadays have fail safes upon fail safes to make it essentially impossible to blow up.
t1_dtod0zw	0.257700	*	Your comment is dripping of racism and reveals your bias here. Roaming bands, dealing drugs, drinking in public, black ghettos... Jesus dude. 
t1_dt7he2u	0.000000	*	Canada is the middle child that moved away from the rest of the family and only calls to check in.

t1_dsknm3n	0.053100	*	Only the money will come out of hiring less staff and reduced infrastructure expenditure, so everyone loses. They cant just start paying their staff less or theyll strike again. 
t1_dsgowh0	-0.961200	*	Weird how it's always Muslims throwing gays off of buildings and stoning adulterers though, huh? Buddhists need to up their game.
t1_dtwpb8p	0.000000	*	American socialist ? Is that even a thing ? (Not being sassy here )I thought Bernie Sanders was the only one who dared say the S word
t1_dt7n031	0.318200	*	That's not how the real world works, you can't just use sketchy logic to justify whatever you want. 
t1_dsthisn	0.000000	*	You mean last year?  He wasn't alive 80 years ago.
t1_dsr32yp	0.000000	*	The problem is that the visual inspection doesnt solve this.  I can reflash my ecu to bypass all smog controls then just flash it back before testing and they wouldnt know.
t1_dsix9kd	0.401900	*	No.  
t1_dsq80tw	0.401900	*	So it's therefore a pencil case?
t1_dtgmlri	0.401900	*	I'm upset?  You overestimate my emotional attachment to anonymous people's opinions on Reddit.  I have no attachment, because they don't matter, I'm just here for the entertainment.
t1_dsn3znb	0.000000	*	Citations?
t1_dtgcer4	0.510600	*	I'm not even surprised anymore. This season of earth has already jumped the shark, And old characters like burlesconi coming back is standard for a team of writers with nowhere to go. 
t1_dsuczac	-0.421500	*	What concrete ways?
t1_dsx8op8	0.340000	*	 Provide scientific proof when life begins. That will prove this is not a philosophical issue.   You can't do that so you paint my ideas as emotional, but you have no logic backing yours up 
t1_dswpeqh	0.340000	*	A fetus is still a person. It will become a person. It has potential. If we got rid of everything we had before its potential was realized then we would have never gotten very far.
t1_dt60fw9	0.000000	*	Holy shit I just looked through your comment history...... I think this is my first interaction with clear Russian propaganda 
t1_dst9pys	-0.659700	*	It is true Israel could have been more careful about civilian casualties during its wars with Hamas. But Israel's goal is to kill terrorists. Hamas' goal is to kill civilians.
t1_dtrgb5n	-0.153100	*	Goddamn I would be angry if someone called for stuff like that while working Helpdesk.
t1_dtbe14s	0.440400	*	More like, groups of people trying to maximize profits.
t1_dt6ur6n	-0.102700	*	Yep. I live in Texas but my business is filed in Delaware.  You just need a registered agent to file it for you and youre golden. My Delaware Corp owns all my other corps. 
t1_dsknndt	0.000000	*	Wait... do you realize you just said there are more guns in London than Chicago?
t1_dsyy5zl	0.338400	*	One man's negative externality is another man's onerous and unnecessary regulation. 
t1_dshhmax	0.000000	*	> We'd look weird as hell  Only because we're used to the way we look currently. If you think about it humans looks pretty darn weird.

t1_dsgp2wt	-0.025800	*	I understand that the initial flood of light into a dark room can be painful, and such an awakening can be uncomfortable.  I underwent the same process myself.  The truth may ultimately set you free.
t1_dsz1h5k	-0.102700	*	Canadian Healthcare is generally better than American health care. 
t1_dtq38lb	0.000000	*	I live in Louisiana. Crawfish make terrible bowls but you gotta do what you gotta do.
t1_dt6q34k	0.820300	*	Well nice attempt at least. Contrary to what millennials think, Americans had nice healthcare pre-Obama. It was actually cheaper for most and better coverage for many back then.
t1_dttdvfu	0.000000	*	...neener neener neener?
t1_dsnwrf4	0.000000	*	I got that impression through reading the rest of your responses. In fact one of them was even complaining about downvotes, as if you couldn't be any more of a spastic.
t1_dtacpl2	0.000000	*	  What kind of dumb game is this? I'm not going to sit through five minutes of video and point out every person that may be bad. If you have a point then just make it. 
t1_dtkxzr2	0.361200	*	Ah but we can regulate their access to antibiotics. If they go to the black market for it after that... At least it won't be as many people
t1_dt8ua7x	0.296000	*	Most Quran burners are idiotic Christian nut pots. They need to be shut the fuck up because they are worse than the Muslims.

t1_dslhcdi	-0.893100	*	Wait what.....are you retarted...Your distinction between country/continent is irrelevant btw. 
t1_dtu97lb	0.401900	*	It's a post scarcity society
t1_dt09q8e	-0.833800	*	Can you read what you just wrote and tell me youre not insane? 
t1_dspcrs4	-0.250000	*	According to most of the world. But I guess we should listen to a country which is constantly invading their neighbors.
t1_dt25x2y	0.421500	*	It would hard for trump to be depressed about no longer being able to do something he has never done.
t1_dt0s95d	0.401900	*	Right. I asked why is he investigating crimes that aren't related to Russian collusion because that's why the special investigator was ordered. It wasn't rhetorical. 
t1_dt1vhdg	0.551400	*	of course you are, you don't want to feel guilt so you just ignore those less fortunate than you.
t1_dtoq3dw	-0.385900	*	That was mainly among the upper elite. It beats slavery, jihad, child rape which is all present in Islam. Also, the hadeeth mandates intra cousin incest, so it isn't entirely free. 
t1_dtupsl6	0.585900	*	Oh you mean like sending a car right?
t1_dsme7eu	0.000000	*	Holy shit the entire system is fucked from the top down but at least you have guns.  You really live down to your username.

t1_dtiys15	-0.593100	*	I didn't do that in any way. I just don't think I'm better than anyone else and have empathy for those who were unlucky enough to be in those situations. 
t1_dsuj0nz	0.421500	*	Sometimes walking past construction cranes or cross the road is absolutely necessary   Eating potentially fatal fish is not... I guess... I don't know, I hate fish...
t1_dsx11su	0.000000	*	The first, reprehensible. The second, curiously tempting. I can't imagine how these could be seen as being anywhere near similarly offensive. 
t1_dtaxbt0	-0.932800	*	I bet she takes the first bite off his plate [probably even before trying what she ordered] when the food arrives at a restaurant. 
t1_dswn6lv	0.534100	*	A lot of great nations are Canadas. South Korea is Japan's Canada. Austria is Germany's Canada. Sri Lanka is India's Canada. Italy has three micro-Canadas.
t1_dt1hc5u	-0.735100	*	Is it really suffering? You guys keep saying that but it's more disappointing than anything else. 
t1_dtr8rg4	-0.776400	*	That's the worst excuse at trying to disguise a dodge I've ever seen.
t1_dte24rs	-0.681800	*	I mean...know it's a pedantic argument. The 1A does not protect you from the law if you threatening violence.  In the eyes of the law, it's already violent. 
t1_dt74rm2	0.000000	*	In Canada, tuition for all levels of university are highly subsidised by government. One could make the argument that doctors benefit from having to pay a subsidised education through society. 
t1_dsmtlcv	-0.380900	*	Okay well chill 
t1_dsmtjgv	-0.476700	*	>It doesnt have anything to do with Trump.  Like I said. A bunch of times.  Doesn't mean it is something to be dismissive of.

t1_dsuvy3q	0.726900	*	> Minimum wage was $4.25 and I made $7.15 an hour.  That's pretty fucking shit. And in no way a livable wage today.  > Hardly slave wages at the time.  When, 1929? 
t1_dswl645	0.000000	*	That might be the most frightening thing I have ever seen on the internet (and I subscribe to /r/morbidreality/).

t1_dtttgma	0.000000	*	Don't worry, we're doing a good job of making sure they die too.
t1_dtelify	-0.585900	*	Each Google search you do requires as much electricity as boiling a kettle of water. I read it on FB.
t1_dtv4br7	0.757900	*	And when the capacity in the hospital is reached, you're stuck waiting because everybody else is seeking immediate treatment and is likely more injured than you and your torn ankle.
t1_dsm30d2	-0.296000	*	Wait, the physical Purple Heart medals given out since the Second World War all date to 1945? We have them in storage somewhere ready to distribute?
t1_dtkxzr2	0.541300	*	Ah but we can regulate their access to antibiotics. If they go to the black market for it after that... At least it won't be as many people
t1_dtol9b1	-0.493900	*	No, prisoners were stuck in camps where the conditions were squalid and you ran a good risk of dying from disease or malnutrition. Look up Andersonville in GA or the Chicago pow camp.
t1_dt19cx0	0.000000	*	Fuck off with your bullshit talking points, Trump boi.
t1_dsu5e5z	0.440400	*	If you're curious, the 25th amendment to the constitution dictates line of succession of the president of the US.

t1_dsgt67m	0.440400	*	There are some free, safe societies, but they are the exception, not the rule. And eventually they are overtaken by a more aggressive one.
t1_dsvt5m0	0.250000	*	>  Haitians and Dominicans had a tight knit relationship   What? This country has never had a tight knit relationship with Haiti. It is true tensions weren't always this high, but never tight knit. 
t1_dt4qt0s	0.318200	*	can all of you just chill a bit? Way too much passive aggressive going on and completely off topic too
t1_dt8u2tu	-0.126000	*	But i'm le tired.

t1_dsrihjf	0.000000	*	Honest question  what does memeing mean in the context you used it?  Trying to be funny? Being lazy? Using a cliche?  Seems less harsh than calling someone an idiot, like theyre just being silly. 
t1_dsppird	-0.900100	*	And you think that we should do what? Throw out the entire mental health industry?
t1_dt32yfb	0.000000	*	It might work if they had any credibility left
t1_dskypga	0.493900	*	Yes, the 35 countries from Developed areas that agreed to give the data out. It specif icy excluded the shitholes lol.

t1_dt3r8qe	0.680800	*	Calm down, mr.  logan paul.
t1_dt9f668	0.685800	*	Let me rephrase the question. What do you personally do to make sure you know what is going on in the world and to be informed about what politicians are doing? Who provides that information for you?
t1_dtfjumz	0.346600	*	Yeah it's abundantly clear you don't want to hear facts that don't suit your world view.  I'm happy to stop wasting any time on you.
t1_dt9bc2e	0.536200	*	They are reporting on a report.... What don't you understand about that?
t1_dsjf6dk	0.584800	*	I just dont buy that excuse. People voted for him. A majority of the Republicans in the primary picked Trump. He is wholly representative of the party and to voters. 
t1_dtteca1	-0.870300	*	Condition 12: don't have somebody prank-SWAT you or you'll die from just opening the door (or not opening the door probably).

t1_dskl4vd	-0.898400	*	The girl didn't consent to sex without a condom. That's a form of rape in my book.

t1_dtgi3uz	0.202300	*	>pretty much one of the highest in the Middle-East...  Rofl, if you are born into the right religion, then it's fine. If you are anything but Jewish, you're going to be an outsider. 
t1_dt2d0tv	0.000000	*	Yet mass shooting still happens every other week, you should spend your energy on your countrys flaws instead defending a minor issue over here

t1_dso29q1	0.000000	*	I love the aside in Night Watch about the neighbors fighting over a hedge. That whole book lays out the Vimes philosophy of policing so well.
t1_dtccezz	-0.128000	*	Ah, the endless debate of whether believing something doesnt exist and lacking belief in a concept are the same thing.  (Theyre not; theres two kinds of atheism: one makes a claim, the other does not)
t1_dty1oh6	0.000000	*	Like I said, denial and mockery. Offer something of substance, or continue to degrade yourself by resorting to ad-hominem non-arguments.
t1_dssxf7j	0.000000	*	It's how cryptocurrency works. If transaction costs don't rise with price, the cyrptocurrency is vulnerable to attacks.

t1_dt7quai	0.421500	*	Yeah, and this is why independent unions are illegal. Because they care about workers. They westernised technologically, so they should westernise politically too

t1_dsvr9zh	-0.250000	*	Whether you like it or not, thats how the gun laws work. Theyre incredibly partisan-split.  Edit: oh shit, sorry. I read it as I dont like to *think* that - my bad

t1_dtje50g	0.137600	*	I don't think we should force any body modification on others. Would you want a child tattooed? Why pierce a child's ears?  Let the kid want it to be like Mom or big Sis and it's normal and fine.
t1_dszi93q	-0.275500	*	People want to purchase it..... before Obamacare they were free not to, and they can still pay the fine which is way lower than premiums. Most people choose to purchase it.

t1_dsvh3bm	-0.747400	*	We *waste* more food every day than we would need to feed the entire planet.  We could increase our meat consumption and still feed everyone. It's an issue of distribution.
t1_dsi3fl8	0.542300	*	We could do it, easily. But weed is still illegal and nobody wants to put it down to help the government when they could work private sector and still smoke weed.

t1_dt05jli	-0.025800	*	It's not about controlling Congress, it's about obtaining 60 votes in the Senate. Do you not realize that?
t1_dtmv3tn	0.226300	*	Are you saying the American public isn't smart enough to understand the contents? I disagree. 
t1_dsjsdm4	-0.154700	*	My concern is for the country.  This isnt a competition.  Its not about winning and losing.  Its about saving the nation from the fallout from that dotard thats in office right now.
t1_dssk53p	-0.848100	*	And yet right above and below that, it talks about the conditions Jews are allowed to enter the Temple Mount.  Also, not all Jews are Ultra Orthodox.

t1_dthi2fc	0.202300	*	What? You're not making any logical sense.  I'm simply asking for evidence. You and nonody else can provide me any. You're getting extremely angry about it and deflecting.  You need help. 
t1_dsyyee3	0.000000	*	You're right. You're way smarter than me and I am too stupid to understand the concept of the hypocrisy of employing double agents in other countries while hoping there are none in your country.
t1_dsmo8ha	0.401900	*	Instead of using the word communist to imply someone is unpatriotic (see senator McCarthy) now people call someone socialist to do the same thing.
t1_dsjfjh5	-0.467200	*	Ironically I have seen many people over the last year say r/Politics is the way it is because of t_d pre Reddit censorship.

t1_dtuqs0p	0.250000	*	Because I wanted to point out and disambiguate the idea that the government pays people. People pay the government to provide services, it's never a charity, as some people fail to grasp. 
t1_dtu53pb	0.202300	*	Even if you had said something mildly rational, your grammar denotes how lacking your education was.

t1_dtj0kyv	-0.709600	*	Not really, since you have extra nerve endings + it keeps moist and sensitive what is meant to be moist and sensitive. Like and eyeball with an eyelid. 
t1_dtkxzr2	-0.344700	*	Ah but we can regulate their access to antibiotics. If they go to the black market for it after that... At least it won't be as many people
t1_dsus4s7	0.151100	*	>kool-aid.  Flavor-ade. Henry Zebrowski made me say this.

t1_dsnajm4	0.915300	*	It's quite good at hiding how democratic it is if the will of the people is disregarded. By your logic, The USSR and North Korea are democratic because hey, they got to vote for their leader.
t1_dtdcf20	0.916000	*	I disagree, just because he has certain skills does not mean he's an overall smart guy or even somebody who should be admired or respected, president or not.  
t1_dtsi1id	-0.526700	*	1. I called him ill informed not you  2. Nothing either of you has said has disproved that
t1_dtc994m	0.458800	*	Interesting. I don't think the should include suicides in those numbers, it seems really disingenuous.
t1_dtqcxqe	-0.202300	*	Then why complain about people that are working to change it?

t1_dt3ygun	-0.401900	*	Some houses also used to have open reservoirs. Like, literally open. Dead mice and other stuff could get in there, not very nice to drink.

t1_dt2ju9p	-0.140600	*	I talked about the government shutdown, because it's happening right now.   And it totally wasn't for the same reason. And Democrats didn't control the 3 branches.
t1_dt70pjn	-0.296000	*	If you think this is just about being offended, then you're completely missing the point.
t1_dsqctkb	-0.879600	*	A lot of the pushback seems to be from people who are more connected to a post millenium, big urban- centric stereotype of Canadian society.

t1_dt00jol	-0.632400	*	Just google it and find articles from December 17.  Everyone know it was suspicious.  A senator named Linda Frum said the day after his death she was certain it was a double homicide.
t1_dsnt0vv	-0.916900	*	And whats their kill count in the last decade?
t1_dt6sau6	-0.300700	*	More just mocking the transparent lol Reddit libruls joke the original commenter was trying to make.   Take it as you will.

t1_dt7f3vl	0.000000	*	of course, people routinely fight over millionaire athletes playing games on tv. people are really dumb
t1_due0j4n	-0.349200	*	You literally said Most of the alt right is hidden behind a computer, and are too much of cowards to actually go kill people (especially based on specifically their race). You're wrong. 
t1_dta6i8l	-0.153100	*	I think he meant more about the passengers fighting back against hijackers armed with box cutters, vs on 911 when people didn't equate a hijacking with slamming into a building.
t1_dsqoz5t	0.000000	*	Of course not.  But odds of the average native German being one was statistically significant enough for many people to be wary of them.

t1_dsfraxt	0.000000	*	Russia and all other asian countries minus 3 will help them out. 
t1_dswohb6	-0.153100	*	I mean, it is biologically. You probably mean person (in which case it's a philosophical discussion).

t1_dtvj6tk	-0.308900	*	I think cancer obviously promotes more suffering than a quick death. This could be a much different conversation if lions had the ability to treat their diseases, like humans do. 
t1_dt94ytr	0.557400	*	An advocate or supporter of fundamental Islam does not mean violent extremist like ISIS, as you said
t1_dtbe14s	0.670500	*	More like, groups of people trying to maximize profits.

t1_dt5uk6l	0.631000	*	Correct me if Im wrong... it seems like that would create not just public outrage but also outrage among congress etc. I feel like it wouldnt be very easy for him to just dismiss it. 
t1_dsk5xbw	0.296000	*	> He made assurances then failed to live up to them.  I'm baffled that anyone doing business with Trump doesn't just *expect* this to happen.
t1_dtus35b	0.658800	*	Hed not have the first clue how to even start that conversation.

t1_dt72fwq	0.936600	*	This is a naive view.  Work is paid based on value not based on whether the person can live on the wage.  The real issue here is that live means something different to every person.

t1_dt4f1uc	0.000000	*	How is relative self determination  (being friendly with fucking Iran for example)  the same as a tzarist conquest and functional annexation.  Iraq isnt a US anything.

t1_dspkx12	0.756200	*	I dislike people telling others, as in teaching them that their feels are the correct path to truth.  Like, you know, teachers and shit.  Also, you're the one who called them stupid, not me.

t1_dtmax6w	-0.959900	*	Its bad because it chose who could have a voice. A monster got put in charge with no way to remove him and europe burned. You enjoy your conspiracy theories.

t1_dtui13w	0.000000	*	How about the West Bank where Palestinians live? If you believe its Israeli territory than Israel should annex it and give locals citizenship otherwise thats apartheid

t1_dse2tsl	0.000000	*	Thing is that those that can vote with their feet do, leaving those that want to (but can't) in an increasing minority. Quite often this means that change is slower and harder to achieve.
t1_dto1pkb	0.025800	*	This right here. What do you think Fort Drum is doing there? Just chillin' right at the border? Kind of an odd place to put a military base, right on an international border.

t1_dtrj22o	0.000000	*	Yeah but it's not a 100% reliable and you have to constantly double-check what you say. You can't be yourself when your family members are on your friend's list.

t1_dsw82t2	-0.423200	*	> Sharks are dangerous animals, and we should be afraid of them.  I was simply correcting this statement.  What seems to be the problem?
t1_dtco20w	-0.476700	*	Lol, everyone who uses oil products has a hard on for the oil industry.  It's just whether or not they're ignorant about it or not.

t1_dso0v52	0.000000	*	ehhh were in luck and only about 1/3 of the country is delusional enough to support this president, mainly because at this point, there's nothing he can do to lose their support.
t1_dtpk571	0.000000	*	You're legitimately delusional.
t1_dtc6xfc	0.680800	*	Hmm. They have managed to survive as an organization despite being hunted by one of the most powerful militaries on earth.  That's impressive.

t1_dt7c3wo	0.000000	*	That's in the Old Testament, and that's a document that is very unreliable. We don't know exactly what's fact or what's fiction.

t1_dtkxhcz	-0.888800	*	I've encountered this in real life on many occasions as well. I just don't find people in real life showing me videos of mutilated live cows. 
t1_dt92ref	0.440400	*	Even most of his enemies would not describe him that way.
t1_dto537z	0.726900	*	As a Canadian, I have always viewed the US as Canada's couch - there's even money to be found down there in the cushions :P

t1_dsu1yri	0.000000	*	I'm not sure if you mean you have massive impenetrable Lego walls or if you just spread them on the roads ahead of advancing armies but I hope it's both
t1_dt86yct	0.571900	*	Great, now why did it tick closer before that? Before you could say shit we are closer to nuclear war. Now it could be just about anything that no on can relate to now. 
t1_dsm55df	-0.775000	*	Neither does Canada, but it is still his job. 
t1_dsztsah	0.000000	*	Educate yourself. MLK and Dubois both held great admiration for Margaret Sanger. Serving the POC community and wanting them dead are not the same thing.
t1_dsx4v3i	-0.553400	*	Kurds deserve a state. End of discussion. Turkey is wrong. 
t1_dsf2kkl	-0.296000	*	If black is a culture because they're unable to determine thier ancestry, wouldn't white in the U.S. be a culture if they've basically given up their original ancestry in favor of American white?
t1_dty51co	-0.905500	*	So this whole death for apostasy and holy war talk is just ironic, huh. And the mass graves are ironic too then?
t1_dtjoxwo	0.361200	*	And it's moral because why? Because you don't like seeing unkempt people?

t1_dt3hjp4	0.469000	*	There is a lot of waste in defense spending too. Much of it isn't even spent on US defense. But we could spend $0 on defense and still have budget / debt problems.
t1_dtg9ndo	0.296000	*	What do you mean by 'casual workers'?  I'm from the U.S. and would think 'casual' would be the opposite of 'professional' but that doesn't make sense in context.

t1_dswp0lf	-0.967800	*	Well not really.  The existence of ambiguity itself supports a less restrictive pro-choice public policy much more than it would support a highly restrictive pro-life public policy. 
t1_dt6uihn	0.371600	*	Effective corporate or average corporate. We were talking about effective though since that was the hot topic in the us.
t1_dt4h4i7	-0.918600	*	Most anyone who's lived there more than a couple of years dislikes China. Again, maybe you just know fuck all about that country?

t1_dsoicb7	0.000000	*	A ramp just makes a heavy barrel feel heavier. They used pulleys and a wooden elevator system most likely.

t1_dtkxber	-0.238900	*	Telling the truth isn't enough. If someone you know uses tanning beds all the time and you're like I hope you enjoy your skin cancer. That's not an effective way to get them to stop.

t1_dth9bev	-0.730600	*	Not liking Donald Trump is not the same as being left-leaning.  His approval rating is 30%, not many people on either side like him.  Because he's an unapologetic asshole.
t1_dsdsn4y	0.764500	*	Did those jobs not exist before 2002? and you are out of your mind if you think they are all employed and not using welfare.

t1_dswro7f	0.000000	*	And what do you think this does to the United States? 
t1_dslid42	0.000000	*	No, I'm not. The parent comment advocates pardoning everyone involved. There's a reason they aren't going to just pardon everyone: some people involved should have been in jail.

t1_dtu9s0y	0.000000	*	yea let's just forget history and let it repeat itself every few centuries
t1_dtedhpc	-0.079800	*	If you're Turkish, the odds are that your mother or father is probably Kurdish.    Why do you hate the Kurds so much when they are not just part of your culture, but literally part of your DNA?
t1_dtmjjmt	0.318200	*	Well I think generally, if you start getting in the habit of cancelling trade deals, people will stop wanting to make them with you and you'll have to start making ones that are worse and worse.
t1_dtgu0wi	0.485400	*	They found the vials had been tampered with. That's the evidence that supports the various testimonies from inside. It's proof. It's not speculation. 
t1_dskstfi	0.000000	*	> No wonder you like Trump.  lololololol again showing that ANY dissension means they are a Trump supporter in your mind.   And you were trying to take the high road... just couldn't resist, could ya?
t1_dtnf6hp	-0.340000	*	Makeup scandal? You mean that lady who got all indignant when she was posted to /r/quityourbullshit last week? That turned out to be a really shitty viral marketing campaign for a MLM?

t1_dt8rdxj	0.612400	*	That rule is genuinely the worst part of the subreddit. Just because you admit it's a circlejerk doesn't make it better.
t1_dtaelqx	0.939800	*	 Ms. is pronounced Miss where I live. Only ever heard Mizz in movies that take place in the southern US. 
t1_dtokskp	-0.995500	*	No. Because they thought their punishment met the crime

t1_dtrb2ss	0.585900	*	No threads here? 
t1_dswp0lf	0.318200	*	Well not really.  The existence of ambiguity itself supports a less restrictive pro-choice public policy much more than it would support a highly restrictive pro-life public policy. 
t1_dt95cv5	0.000000	*	>  Montana should have just as much weight as California.  Not if you want to be logical and have a government that is actually for the people.
t1_dtg2o60	0.469600	*	The growth is still due to Obama setting the stage, deal with it! Also like I said, the Dow doesn't mean jack to 99% of the people working! It could go over 100,000 and it wouldn't change a thing...

t1_dsn0ih0	0.778300	*	This isn't really true. Most of our defenses are designed to intercept during mid-course and terminal. I work with those systems. 
t1_dt8dra6	0.472800	*	How do polls indicating that polarization is increasing in Europe not accurate? lol
t1_dt9ztng	-0.340000	*	I love double posts, I can downvote twice.

t1_dsp5dti	-0.308900	*	I'm not assuming that at all, the opposite is plainly true and I'm marvelling at it
t1_dswkl4r	-0.762700	*	There is no life, only a fetus and that fetus has no legal rights. The only person with rights is the pregnant woman who gets to decide what goes on inside her body.

t1_dtndo3j	-0.220600	*	It's not that I don't care, its that I fail to see how it reveals, or can be used to buttress the claim that Trump colluded with Russia.  
t1_dtmzpst	-0.226300	*	Regardless, the Hadiths are still considered an inseparable part of sacred law.  The question is not only of The Koran but of Islam, and the Hadiths are a fundamental part of Islam.

t1_dsnnmii	0.153100	*	Yeah, I don't know what the other guys problem is.  This is like grade 6 math.
t1_dtd2lk7	0.000000	*	So, in an effort to get back at Obama, he had to enlist the Russian's help to become President. Only to prove to the world that he's just as much of a joke as he was made out to be.

t1_dskzkvt	0.000000	*	The issue is that you even consider the possibility of silencing an entire political party an option.
t1_dsionot	-0.757900	*	All this time the GOP's been saying that Dems are soft on crime and I only now realized they're totally right. I just didn't realize they were talking about *committing* crimes, not *punishing* them.
t1_dsr9btd	-0.771700	*	No, they did move there, but they moved back.  Then they decided to sue the school district for millions.  The family was legally slapped down in court.
t1_dsu2zjh	0.515200	*	They want it to be one. Hence the currency in cryptocurrency. I treat it like an asset and made a killing by investing in December and cashing out at 20k.
t1_dtczhj4	0.659700	*	Its certainly better for business AND for money to support science and innovation. This anti-intelligence crusade their party is on will cripple the us economy if it wins out.

t1_dsomsqb	-0.296000	*	You can't just say you have a firm understanding of something in an attempt to win an argument, especially if you've just demonstrated you don't understand something. 
t1_dsm6izp	0.616600	*	In what way am i hypocritical? I made no assertions or denials. I was merely drawing attention the the inherent irony that is human ego. I never said I lacked it.

t1_dttwe0m	0.493900	*	The Brits, even with their royalty, have more class mobility than we do in the States. 
t1_dskczxw	0.820100	*	dont try to copycat me. srsly. makes u look like a child.  
t1_dsz19ga	0.000000	*	America is a post-developed country. 
t1_dtjm4mw	-0.289300	*	If you read around the beginning, there are higher chances for UTI and possibly kidney problems if circumcision is done at an older age.

t1_dsyva1r	0.273200	*	How do you know what any one particular immigrants intention is?
t1_dtd6pra	0.000000	*	Yeah cuz you can just claim someone is racist without proof? Quite foolish! Im gonna spend the rest of this Sunday with my wife and children and not worry about you trolls. Good day to you.
t1_dt6u00s	-0.381800	*	> have nothing but good intentions.  HA! Good one.
t1_dtjg8v5	-0.542300	*	What evidence do you have to support any of these claims.
t1_dt6gz1e	0.836000	*	For themselves and their families? Maybe I was a little too general in my comment. 
t1_dtwxswa	0.830400	*	Poverty is great tho?
t1_dsf0xc4	0.000000	*	Microbeads are way smaller than bristles of a toothbrush, plastic beads on massagers or anything the like. They've less than 1mm in any dimension.
t1_dtq5q21	0.000000	*	It absolutely would not.    Russia, very obviously, does not mind a war on their border. Russia does not care if a war will start a refugee stream.
t1_dsl0vfj	0.571900	*	Even if it was the last one.  ***Especially*** if it was the last one. 
t1_dsi4ttm	0.000000	*	I do not think it means what he thinks it means. 
t1_dszwyf6	-0.848100	*	Huh? That dude is completely rational, and right too. What exactly did you read in that comment that you would consider a vast over-estimation?
t1_dswm5n0	-0.624900	*	Except for the ones that aren't. Leaving open legal grounds to force someone to carry their rapist's child to term is far more horrific, imo.
t1_dtd4wk9	-0.947400	*	If trump had won fairly then maybe. But when you are seeking out help from foreign countries to get elected all of that goes out the window. 
t1_dskyci3	0.000000	*	And how many turrets do you need per, say 100 drones?
t1_dsmf8g5	0.616600	*	And Abe Froman would know.
t1_dsitan4	0.000000	*	Have you seen the street sign? It spells out BABISANDZ in the Roman Alphabet. 
t1_dswsipp	0.476700	*	It is not arbitrary though, and the laws that the government enact must pass a examination before the court. You should read up on this before making these assumptions. 
t1_dts3hgu	0.000000	*	No it's not, looking at things as they are today provides the most context for how everyone invovled is affected by what is happening. 
t1_dtx51or	0.000000	*	(from the US) yep - voting integrity should really be a federal issue and not something left to the states to decide, at least for federal elections.
t1_dtod9or	0.361200	*	It's because we are statistically hotter than the rest of Canada.  Where like that girl who's bullshit you put up with cuz she's just awesome to look at.
t1_dt8809o	-0.493900	*	This comment was near unintelligible.  Can you clarify?
t1_dszibeo	0.000000	*	What do you think Donald Trump meant when he said he fired Comey over the Rusher thing?
t1_dt8yiom	0.919600	*	Also their names were Admiral Dewey, Dr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady.   No, I'm not joking. 
t1_dt1so10	-0.868600	*	Well not that it will change your mind as I doubt you can imagine the scenario, but what if you don't have any other choice for work? 
t1_dt5a6cl	0.786900	*	But the US is also an extremely patriotic and nationalistic country compared to other developed countries. I would definitely be concerned about being hometowned in the US.

t1_dt07ruu	0.000000	*	There isn't a single double negative in that statement.  Edit: there ain't no double negatives nowhere in that post 
t1_dt6o87n	0.226300	*	No but they did once slaughter an entire city and made a pyramid of severed heads. Wonderful chaps they were. 
t1_dsg94kv	-0.510600	*	Trump plays 4th demential chess while the others play pick up sticks.   I think Hillary, Obama and the rest of the scum bags in DC will look smashing in Prison Orange. 
t1_dtthpm5	0.795900	*	They do! But not the current big ones. There were four companies back in the 30's that became what is now Audi.
t1_dtg7gck	0.918600	*	Can you explain to me(an American with an interest in politics) what exactly the game of mates is?

t1_dt9xnpp	0.770400	*	LMFAO i cannot believe the comments that Im reading here. People here are totally ok with policing speech it seems.
t1_dsse8y5	-0.526700	*	The Westboro Baptists are assholes, but they don't go around killing people. You can ignore them and be fine.   It's not just christians who object to murdering children. 
t1_dt3tmfk	-0.051600	*	Hello brother/sister. It's nice to know the truth is known to more people.
t1_dsut74a	-0.842600	*	Tbh not much exists in Wyoming. Why dont we use a state that is representative of the actual country?
t1_dt9xawe	-0.079800	*	Exactly. Tons of philosophy people go into coding type careers. I suppose it undermines their worldview if lowly liberal arts people can get well-respected STEM jobs, though
t1_dsj1b1m	0.743000	*	> National Socialists were super militarily aggressive.  Did you just called the Nazis left? Wow .... the US education system is worse than i thought.

t1_dtitxn4	0.000000	*	No this is like saying there's no meaningful distinction between someone throwing 5 buckets of gas on fire and someone throwing 4 buckets of gas and 1 bucket of water on fire.
t1_dtxevvs	-0.296000	*	>Say hello to fifty new Hitlers.  You seem to be implying that if the US was not invading sovereign nations, we'd have fifty new Hitlers
t1_dsvsyob	-0.373600	*	But his daughters and their husbands are American Jews, not Israelis. And it is fact the overwhelming majority of American Jews support Israel. 
t1_dsu3p88	-0.250000	*	You are so brainwashed by your video games you think the Palestinians drop the bombs. As I said, stop embarrassing yourself. 
t1_dsq6q7o	0.000000	*	That is how a leader works.  The day after the election when dems were literally rioting in the streets, he effectively ended TPP, that alone moved him out ahead of Obama.  
t1_dtskg8c	-0.144100	*	Egypt, when they blockaded Israel's ports, and lined up their troops along the boarder.

t1_dttaigw	-0.927400	*	Fine, then it was a deflection.  It's still whataboutism. Trump is doing X! Well, what about Hillary?!.
t1_dtkfonb	-0.275500	*	Which explains the lack of Cage. 
t1_dtb0ftk	0.690800	*	I always used to test there with here and added a t.  I know the POV isn't right, but it was easier to remember.   
t1_dsus31s	-0.510600	*	Most of them that I know are issue voters, and Trump said more about those issues than Hillary. Whether he's addressing them satisfactory or not is another thing. 
t1_dt2odbz	0.000000	*	> Nobody has proved the big bang to have happened.  [Christians being full of shit again.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Observational_evidence)

t1_dtb7a03	-0.433700	*	> your right  Insulting people for their ignorance while using your instead of you're.  This might be the most quintessential internet comment ever.

t1_dtets24	-0.972300	*	Sure it does if it is declining it's obviously not being propagated. That makes no sense. 
t1_dsl3dct	0.518700	*	Not sure what point you are making. Thats like saying I would like this cake more if it had no calories, but I am still going to enjoy this cake since its here.  Its a pointless statement. 
t1_dtj8wwj	0.886800	*	Well make sure to put a nice comfy chair in front of your window and get some popcorn to watch the action outside :)  Judging by the votes you're wrong. REDDIT HAS SPOKEN
t1_dsjuirg	-0.740800	*	Democrats account for 80% of gun deaths in major cities. Same criminals are voting to take away gun rights. 
t1_dt8toxc	0.000000	*	i guess he's fighting for kids to have a choice when it's not medically necessary to have it removed but yeah he's being a little over the top.

t1_dsvbfpl	0.000000	*	Great point: If you cook the books by adding undeveloped nations to the statistics, it almost makes you look like you aren't a total fucking idiot. Almost.

t1_dszy36k	0.000000	*	> That's why you have gun control to change the culture.  That isn't how things work. Take a sociology class. They actually go over this topic in the intro classes.
t1_dtoh8rz	0.401900	*	And if you asked these people who they voted for, the majority would did vote would probably say Trump. Who, unironically, produces pretty much every POS product that his line sells in China.

t1_dstqenh	-0.200300	*	The article has no evidence of Trump doing anything. I dont get how anyone gives him credit when he did nothing.

t1_dsoq1da	0.340000	*	How am I even being binary there, I'm pointing out one similarity between two distinct groups. I never said they were exactly the same, I said they used similar logic in this situation.

t1_dtwo2bo	-0.296000	*	It's only this specific product, though. It's more like equally punishing multiple students who are undermining the rest of the class.
t1_dsfl5yu	0.648600	*	So asking someone whether or not they'll listen is a sidestep? Why waste my time when you're just the alt of the other account?

t1_dssr01p	0.000000	*	Oh ok, what's the difference? What I said still kinda fits? But a delusional is still a delusional no matter where they come from.
t1_dsezv6t	0.737100	*	Yes. That's why I don't own a car and use public transport wherever humanly possible. I rent a car when necessary.
t1_dsjvpol	-0.202300	*	Pretty sure all that money that we sink into our defense budget is a tad (a lot) bit more than that of immigration....
t1_dtgu0wi	0.000000	*	They found the vials had been tampered with. That's the evidence that supports the various testimonies from inside. It's proof. It's not speculation.

t1_dswog9t	0.381800	*	To state it briefly: the various impacts to the life of the mother, all of which are circumstantial.  I could list them if you want but I'm sure you're familiar.

t1_dstxo8e	-0.968200	*	 Every man made structure has a point of vulnerability. Topping the list of possibilities is hubris.
t1_dspm8z0	0.356100	*	No the point here is that just because a book claims its the truth doesn't prove it actually is. Unless you can prove that the bible is factually correct this discussion is moot.
t1_dt4sfzm	0.000000	*	Of course, but it will be a world leader if not the most powerful country so its particularly important. I think the point still stands.

t1_dtvgxz2	-0.140600	*	Yes, but I don't see how my actions are relevant to the argument. Even if I were a hypocrite it wouldn't make the argument itself invalid.

t1_dtl8y8o	0.920100	*	No it doesn't it traps dirt. That's why you have to pull it back to properly clean it.  I've also never had segnma. Cleaninliness is definitely not an advantage in that sense.

t1_dt5uk6l	-0.403500	*	Correct me if Im wrong... it seems like that would create not just public outrage but also outrage among congress etc. I feel like it wouldnt be very easy for him to just dismiss it.

t1_dtn6boe	0.318200	*	Well, without the reference, it's meaningless.  The fact that they're saying it on T_D makes it even more suspect, since that sub is as biased as biased can be.

t1_dsnla3z	-0.540100	*	Your economic predictions are hilariously out of touch with reality.  Show me an example of something akin to your predictions happening.  Ever.  I'll wait.

t1_dtj0txj	-0.771700	*	That's kind of fucked up. I can see why youd prioritize families over single people... but not women over men.. or single mothers over single fathers.
t1_dsmyc5q	0.672000	*	Look at their most controversial post of all time, it reached all and went straight to 0. There are more trump haters than supporters, and the format of reddit crushes discussion in that situation.
t1_dskbuv0	-0.194000	*	He can't expand it because nobody goes there. Place is a ghost town. I don't think I've ever seen anyone even turn in.

t1_dtaumg9	0.000000	*	Actually, it's an article about Trump sucking. It's an article about a shitty President.
t1_dtom8aa	0.000000	*	Ahahahaha sxec, media inglese fa schifo!
t1_dt88a2b	0.525200	*	  Well that explains it. I truly hope one day you're allowed to speak freely about legitimate grievances with your government.
t1_dsjlb00	0.684400	*	Man, the rampant nationalism among the Dutch is hard to get through. Its just a perfect nation that operates without a hint of typical human behavior. 
t1_dshrl99	-0.006200	*	Are you implying that Trump is on the take?  If so, where's your proof?
t1_dtx6o0s	0.000000	*	Only Felons lose their rights, unless your misdemeanor is domestic violence related, and that's just guns.

t1_dtj78p5	0.839900	*	This whole thread is entirely opinion based.  I'm not blind. I can see the difference. But the difference between me and you is, I could not care less. 
t1_dsszc1y	-0.831600	*	It would be moderately more justified, but adults sending their children to die is almost never okay.
t1_dsvjao8	-0.943300	*	Why is it that nearly every story involving Israel is them doing something bad, and in the end the story is debunked?
t1_dsljif7	0.000000	*	black 95%, mulatto and white 5%   Contemporary usage of the term mulatto in Haiti is applied to thexa0bourgeoisie, pertaining to high social and economic stature.  
t1_dsze3gs	0.000000	*	You got the best doctors in the world. We can all agree on that. And the hope is that one day all US citizens will have access to their excellent expertise. 
t1_dtowkyd	0.593200	*	the alt-right basically made it a standard talking point to accuse the left of being fascist or totalitarian - clear case of projection/NLP strategy 
t1_dsut3cc	-0.421500	*	Card? It is the electoral process. Either understand it or don't.  
t1_dsjvpol	-0.057300	*	Pretty sure all that money that we sink into our defense budget is a tad (a lot) bit more than that of immigration....
t1_dts3k6e	0.555000	*	Oh absolutely. Ive had anger issues since Im a child and its gotten a lot better recently. I went from throwing shit around and punching walls to cursing on reddit.
t1_dto6d54	0.062300	*	Canada being annexed into the US would result in a drastic political shift to the left. That would be really interesting.
t1_dskn6vq	0.000000	*	So get the votes needed. That is the essence of a Democratic system is it not? If you want something work for it.
t1_dta1vh4	0.000000	*	So... what you're saying is that I should move to Germany?
t1_dswmose	-0.250000	*	The fact almost all of them do cheat overrides that.  If they don't like it they can try live/compete in a country that does not try lie and cheat every chance they get.
t1_dsvzd5t	-0.273200	*	Downvote me instead of accepting your limitations as your limitations and not as the limitations of every other human?  How predictable and yet still so sad.
t1_dsmj3c7	-0.296000	*	If I have to do the work of searching for sources for the article to seem legit than it is a shit article. Kapeesh?

t1_dsgzv0z	0.000000	*	But then you run into people (even in this thread) saying it was bought out and ruined by a US company, whereas 3G is a Brazilian company
t1_dsz3llp	0.757900	*	If the will of the majority is to prevent people from dying easily preventable deaths and save money doing so at the same time, you damn well better believe it.
t1_dsuonfd	0.000000	*	The Soviets would have rolled on Europe at the first sign of Nuclear aggression. They would have made it to The Coast faster than the Nazis did. Our forces in Germany at this time paled in comparison.
t1_dsoehod	-0.636100	*	Thanks for stalking my comment history  I plan on hopefully coming to live in America eventually... Though in all likelihood, given my chosen career i'll be living in a blue state.

t1_dsmcbui	0.440400	*	As someone whos been to Haiti (military aid), I wouldnt even want to be a dictator there. That place is beyond shitty. Id rather go back to Afghanistan than live in Haiti.
t1_dttpv8b	0.458800	*	The loss of coal and oil isnt going to be what does it. We need to be moving far away from them anyways 
t1_dtwyjtf	0.000000	*	#JIMMINY JILLIKERS

t1_dsdgo2c	0.000000	*	they have some leverage, i wouldn't say they have control.   It wouldn't be easy to send millions of refugees to europe, especially if tension between eu and turkey are high. 
t1_dt39z3i	0.839600	*	Correct without mechanisms for Capital Accumulation it would stop money from naturally becoming unevenly distributed and would make for a much better merit based society. 
t1_dthr04z	0.765000	*	So... Why would I paint them with a broad brush?
t1_dsgygul	-0.557400	*	I mean, that's part of the human experience tho. I could have an aneurysm before finishing this po-

t1_dsqfcmi	0.042400	*	So you never wanted to discuss policy and expected others to discuss it with you? Is this some reused trolling strategy from The_Dotard? Smells of stable genius.
t1_dt1kass	0.549900	*	Kanpai!
t1_dstq7sz	0.000000	*	It's called Glorious Leaderade in NK. Kim Il Sung invented it, as he was also an accomplished chemist.

t1_dsussgs	-0.822500	*	I disagree, but here's to hoping we get a ban on *all* work visas, especially H1Bs.  Americans need the space to shift into knowledge work as automation rises.
t1_dtj5mf0	0.440400	*	no, they should sleep in homeless shelters, but they'd have to give up their drugs and alcohol to do that
t1_dsf4n77	0.361200	*	Probably tastes ok
t1_dstxdr0	-0.911400	*	Do you think he was referring to microbes, or just using anything as a shorthand for sentient animal life? I don't think we have any ultra-radical Jainists on this sub.

t1_dtnyjxr	0.939200	*	I literally googled consumer spending 2017 and posted the first result. Thats pretty shitty cherry picking if it were the case.
t1_dt65iwi	0.799800	*	How flattering of you. Can't debate on merit, so you attack the person instead.

t1_dt5dhiw	0.000000	*	Theres a reason for those comments. The users 138k in Karma in under a year, making unpopular claims, is one of them. 
t1_dsnupcu	0.000000	*	He said you have a lack of self awareness. Are you really that fragile that you can only respond by saying it's an 'ad-hominem' fallacy?
t1_dt9aydt	0.000000	*	The current problem is not whether they'll vote, but getting them to agree on who to vote for, traditional democrat or progressive democrat.
t1_dto3jg4	0.000000	*	Iraq's always been a shithole, man. I'm not saying the US did any better but a dictator who gassed his own people is really a 'better' situation to you because he had nice parades?
t1_dtdqkhj	0.000000	*	The Taiwan situation is pretty shit but they're most definitely not occupied by China.
t1_dtx3zma	0.557400	*	I can't make accusations unless I confirm it. But from your post I can infer that you are trying to give real life form to your incest sexual fantasy.
t1_dsk6nnn	-0.273200	*	We have borders that are illegally crossed often. Immigration from Mexico is lower due to the Trump effect but that doesn't mean letting illegals stay. They have to go back.
t1_dshzuib	0.757900	*	No, not in political neutrality, in the validity of the documents leaked. I would love to see what they held back on the RNC, but it changes Jack diddly shit about what we found out about the DNC.

t1_dt1bbz0	-0.361200	*	A lot of people have accused them of funding ISIS, and the fact that ISIS only attacked their enemies and never them is rather telling that is likely true.
t1_dtig0o8	0.360700	*	Don't question it or your a terrorist. The price of keeping it open is inconsequential when the price of closing it is FREEDOM^(tm)
t1_dtruzgl	-0.855500	*	Italians commit crime therefore mass immigration from Africa is a good thing.   Hurrrrp Duuurrrp. Do you think before you type?

t1_dt0fu2c	-0.308900	*	Why didn't you comment on the other link then. Better be pedantic about the validity of the other. Fucking troll. 
t1_dsxxtg2	0.401900	*	Yknow, just because something was posted on reddit doesn't make it meta.
t1_dtqbj47	-0.690800	*	I didn't say it's too hard. I said it's over.

t1_dse44rw	0.000000	*	I don't think either of them have delivered yet. People overestimate how far along crypto is. This is like angel investor stage.
t1_dtopbhh	0.440400	*	What a great argument alongside your implication. Such contribution! As long as we can refute and point at the bad guy am I right?

t1_dsppudt	-0.873300	*	It's a terror tactic, but they know full well the rockets are ineffective. Treating them as an actual threat is disingenuous no matter who's doing it.

t1_dta5tco	-0.274600	*	The people and the media.  Also, you completely sidestepped my point. You basically said anyone who don't support democracy are bad people.
t1_dskvxnz	-0.611000	*	I hope you dont mind if I excuse myself from your house too, although that might be tricky because I doubt you speak like this when youre not behind a keyboard.
t1_dta6f1w	0.000000	*	I'm actually a smart-ass. Since you did not correctly classify me, you are now subject to arrest for slander.

t1_dt63oob	-0.226300	*	Of course, I'm not saying we should do this and I don't think we should. I'm just saying that it would be very possible to create a system like that securely right now if a government wanted to.
t1_dsmszmb	0.361200	*	To say that British food represents the rest of Europes palette would be grossly incorrect though 
t1_dsu4t7q	0.000000	*	I'm surprised there isn't 'Fuckcoin, The Bitcoin of Sex' being shilled on porn sites.

t1_dtbxshl	0.411800	*	That makes sense. I also love your username because I generally am the same way hahaha. The problem is that I hate myself for being cynical because I absolutely loathe cynicism. 
t1_dsyl8hq	-0.117900	*	You willfully ignorant piece of shit. You actually are defending a known racist term with false equivalencies. Gtfo.
t1_dt3a1db	0.401900	*	I don't really see why this is related. A human losing motor function due to TBI, has nothing to do with a deer losing its leg and running away in a hunting scenario.
t1_dtsx4e5	0.519800	*	I see that you seem to think that radicalism in the middle east has nothing to do with western interference in those regions from time.

t1_dsir0er	-0.273200	*	That's not irony, dummy... 
t1_dtar667	0.000000	*	My point is that there would be no such story about Obama. He didn't cry about fake news and poor treatment from media on a daily basis.
t1_dsjo73e	-0.859100	*	And?  Why should that should stop us from legal immigrants from Haiti who would otherwise qualify? Is there something fundamentally wrong with Haitian people?

t1_dso43nu	-0.748800	*	Personally I think it's important to bear in mind the relative educational attainment of Brexit and Trump supporters. For you to conflate that with a meaningless response is just childish.
t1_dsn3znb	0.636900	*	Citations?
t1_dsm5z5j	0.609200	*	Dude likes the condiment. Idk what else there is to say. You all are saying someone is wrong for enjoying something that doesn't negativitly affect others. Immature if nothing else 
t1_dt5zp34	0.000000	*	If Obama passed Trump's agenda, then we wouldn't have a problem with Obama. Same goes for McCain.

t1_dtqa39w	-0.296000	*	It literally says Fox News on the corner of the screen the entire time Hannity is speaking. He's masquerading as news.
t1_dt6l37q	0.440400	*	Yes, our left is the rest of the worlds right.  We *hardly* have left wing representation.  Popular vote doesnt mean shit for presidential elections. Its not really something to focus on very much.

t1_dsut8kn	-0.901300	*	You said never any mention.  When did the goal post become not guilty.  Trump was notorious for not renting to black people.
t1_dtd2a4q	0.000000	*	Thats LONDON. One of the elite cities of the WORLD. He is living in Kansas which is just a big corn field.
t1_dtnezj9	0.418800	*	We are cowards.   We'd rather have what is bad and familiar than what is potentially great but unknown.

t1_dtd2lk7	-0.077200	*	So, in an effort to get back at Obama, he had to enlist the Russian's help to become President. Only to prove to the world that he's just as much of a joke as he was made out to be.

t1_dtayb3t	-0.657900	*	Ironfist sucked so hard. Dude couldn't fight and half the season was about the stupid sand snake girl. Who cares that this asian lady is training kids martial arts to rob people?

t1_dssj24m	-0.816200	*	STFU dude.  If you don't watch it you're allowing someone else to make a decision for you.  That is not right in any standard. 
t1_dtdeq2a	0.250000	*	How is he letting that person win? He made valid points in all of his posts. Who cares if he expresses emotion in his writing? It just shows that he cares about the subject.
t1_dtlnd82	0.250000	*	What if you had a barrel-less weapon
t1_dslamk3	0.000000	*	Canada and Britian = communist lol

t1_dtq4st8	0.202300	*	Apoc Now is prob the best war not war movie there is.
t1_dt9b677	0.257000	*	It's not. The Republican side of the scales dip vastly into the burning pits of hell at this point. But perjury! According to the assclown in this thread.
t1_dta644p	0.641600	*	It's not against the law [Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_prosecutor]

t1_dtj9grx	0.352700	*	Eh I pay my taxes for the clever people to use my money for the good of society. 
t1_dsqsd1j	0.204000	*	Unless I punch further away from the body workout weights and just 1cm punches with the weights.
t1_dt51sx6	0.318200	*	So percentages are valid, but only when they conform to your worldview. Got it.
t1_dta2arq	0.000000	*	Oh good Lord.  In America, liberal IS left. 
t1_dt5a53g	0.440400	*	Hmm, but can't automation be considered the same as just outsourcing labor to the machine-owners?
t1_dsqb1mk	0.000000	*	The amount of effort you must put in trying to tell others how outraged they are is pathetic. 
t1_dshuojq	0.893400	*	Lol. You think people are too dumb to know Greek words on Reddit.   You got egg on your face. 
t1_dsx5ivd	0.524800	*	>over every single other thing that *matters*  That's pretty subjective. Yeah, some people think humans matter more than everything else. What's your point?
t1_dttdvay	0.296000	*	Aren't you referring to junior doctors with no experience though. Iv seen doctors drive very nice cars.
t1_dt3ivv6	0.000000	*	Wut
t1_dt5l32h	-0.353500	*	Yes, which is why there have been quite a few Islamic terrorist attacks in England, obviously caused by moderate Islamists. Let's not forget the Sharia law courts. 
t1_dsjvtwo	0.000000	*	And what about the other end of the spectrum? This only talks about poverty? Try looking at rates of higher education. 
t1_dtv4br7	-0.542300	*	And when the capacity in the hospital is reached, you're stuck waiting because everybody else is seeking immediate treatment and is likely more injured than you and your torn ankle.
t1_dt70lpk	-0.726900	*	He wasn't fired just for being a white male so your point is irrelevant.
t1_dtblaib	0.051600	*	Also government is the legal system, also in an unregulated capitalistic society corporations can buy the legal system, also in any society gangs can use corruption and persuasion to get their way.
t1_dtrf75m	0.000000	*	And whatsapp is owned by facebook anyways so its really just a different coat of paint
t1_dszy2fw	0.556300	*	I doubt he was leaving anything to the cousins he had been battling in court.     There was a family feud.

t1_dtdltwm	0.913400	*	Well then how would this be any different with Bitcoin?
t1_dt2wi7p	0.122500	*	I think the iPhone shows that you can keep selling to the same customers.

t1_dsz8xk4	0.401900	*	India is not a third world country.  Sure, there's poverty just like in China, but they are an industrialized nation.  We're not talking shithole countries like in Africa.
t1_dsk94ns	-0.492700	*	huts? wow dude.
t1_dt0r68y	0.297000	*	And just not caring about consequences is what's bad.

t1_dt6l4u5	0.000000	*	Cant decide if youre being purposefully obtuse, or you really dont understand the difference between threatening somebodys life and other types of speech. Either way, peace. 
t1_dt6q613	0.038200	*	The US is 50 states though!  Both entities negotiate trade as a single body.
t1_dt8wk3b	-0.690800	*	OK fairy land man, you keep believing that forefather fairytale bullshit. His comment is correct.
t1_dtmg7fq	-0.510600	*	I have, and they did. What specifically are you even referring too? Sources?
t1_dsrvdj0	0.851900	*	How exactly does one tell the difference? Voluntary ejection from a functioning aircraft versus emergency ejection from a damaged one?
t1_dsmm6sh	0.000000	*	A catapult?   Look, I know a wall isnt the most impregnable piece of infrastructure, but why would you bring such an inferior siege weapon into this? 
t1_dthbca7	-0.273200	*	Ok. That has nothing to do with my point though. If they have enough evidence they would have charged him.
t1_dtj7jsi	0.202300	*	> Me: I like my dick...  Your very own words.
t1_dthtf12	0.817300	*	Just because there are 2 major parties does not automatically make republicans 50% of the country lol
t1_dto5ur6	0.000000	*	You're going to have to be more specific than Trudeau cut funding to scientists also posting a source wouldn't hurt 
t1_dsmk2ks	0.051600	*	The point is: not *anyone* would buy it, not at that price.
t1_dst9uq4	0.401900	*	you make me out of u ass? 
t1_dts7hdr	0.000000	*	Well they are putting the interests of foreigners above the interests of the US so IDK how you want to call it?

t1_dt6ir6v	-0.535600	*	I think youre mistaken about something, the dossier wasnt done by M15. There is a former agent name Michael Steele who works for fusion GPS. Fusion GPS is the company that worked on the Dossier
t1_dtwoxwd	0.000000	*	So the centrist party is like wearing a tuxedo t-shirt then huh? 
t1_dsnx5ys	0.932500	*	This is just a whole new level of wtf. These people are crazy! Thanks, that's today's rabbit hole.
t1_dtsqosi	0.361200	*	So do I. That doesn't take away that 99% of the people being called Nazis are not Nazis.
t1_dtd6zs8	-0.571900	*	Reported 
t1_dt8zd7f	0.128000	*	No, that's why I said you were ill informed.  If I spouted off myvassumption of a law in your state and was wrong, then i'm ill informed.
t1_dt2v7v0	0.000000	*	Your American perspective has nothing to do with the topic at hand then. Get off your high horse and stop being a dick.

t1_dt1uqdj	-0.893400	*	Hey overpopulation's a real threat to the future, those pro-lifers can suck a fuck
t1_dt9dwhq	0.458800	*	I like Trump personally, so no thanks, I don't want more lies printed. 
t1_dtolkbw	0.000000	*	That would be pretty tough to do. The North had endless amounts of european immigrants streaming in, and had no reservations about throwing them into the meat grinder.
t1_dshr0mk	-0.690800	*	It really is though. People try to put down living in America, but it it's really a lot better than most people in Reddit have to say. We're so spoiled we think we are living in horrible conditions.
t1_dtf9j62	-0.324400	*	There is only a security flaw when used in certain ways.   There are ways to use those instructions which wouldn't comprise a security flaw.   
t1_dttriqf	-0.883400	*	The article I linked to is the subject, women did die. Women die in Islam protesting the head scarf all the time. Why are you dismissive of it? 
t1_dtigg7o	-0.819200	*	I'm not arguing it was legal. A captured enemy mastermind is still a POW.
t1_dtpwh1c	-0.526700	*	When your conscience says law is immoral, don't follow it. For this I was sentenced to 25 years in jail.
t1_dsk6nqu	-0.659700	*	We have before. Iraq, for starters.
t1_dskom2k	0.273200	*	>real world experiences   Those are feelings. Conservatives are so emotional they literally can't tell what's true. It's a cult. 
t1_dtn47nq	0.958200	*	Can't accept that Cubans have achieved social reform?   Is it that hard to Google these days?
t1_dttw8gk	0.000000	*	Im not really sure how the royal family ties into this at all?
t1_dtp0bs6	-0.340000	*	I hope you got warranty on it, and can exchange it for a working one, BRO. Seems to be malfunctioning.  
t1_dthxais	-0.510600	*	Well, asking for proof for something that is commonly known is just an attempt to mislead and derail.  Especially if you take his russia-apologist comment history into consideration.
t1_dtqw7fb	-0.178600	*	Yes, yes they are.. and I sympathize with their people. But, in this example, they tore down schools, dude. That's sorta a sketch thing to do. 
t1_dtm2si3	0.000000	*	To be fair, so does capitalism. I think people just look for reasons to be horrible.
t1_dsvnj1m	0.897900	*	You are not at all a very stable genius.

t1_dt8v9yb	0.371900	*	You are a stupid attempt at a troll.  I am certain you are a racist and an Islamophobe, just as your Russian masters wish you to be.
t1_dtw04po	0.000000	*	Weirdly flavoursome for a bird that eats fish (what could be worse?)  Lots of cheap flights keep popping up from the east coast and the UK. Get involved! 
t1_dt9a3gl	0.000000	*	I'm doing my best, but I don't think any comment is ridiculous enough to distinguish satire from fact.

t1_dt09vg9	-0.492600	*	he's quadruple, really
t1_dsno63b	0.000000	*	He knows that, that's why he took the time to tell you that. Instead of passing him, you should be thanking him for teaching you something valuable.
t1_dt0zwhv	0.000000	*	Do you know what a turd is?
t1_dtz8n4y	-0.521600	*	Actually, I have 0 debt and take heat care of myself.  Haven't been sick for more than a day in a decade.  Nice try though.  Learn a viable skill and see where that gets you. Life changing. 
t1_dsn99nv	0.000000	*	This man gates.  *edit : Obligatory Indeed.*
t1_dsk0ogc	0.000000	*	Right?  You'd think if you're going to go around calling someone a racist you would actually have proof of them being racist.
t1_dsfjjcr	0.000000	*	Their oil industry didn't fail. It was a global collapse in OPEC revenue.
t1_dsr22b4	0.000000	*	Yes but VW already got in trouble for that. Surly that will stop any future craziness of the sort! /s? 
t1_dtgzp63	-0.636900	*	Why wont you answer?  Is it because you want us to go to war with russia, but you won't fight yourself?
t1_dsrsayw	0.855500	*	I do want to make that statement. Obama was not a good president. But he was a decent diplomat. 
t1_dsrjiyn	-0.900100	*	I understand your point and whilst it may seem extreme it would be perfectly legitimate control measure for an IT business. Data is the new gold you know!
t1_dsl5mv8	0.492600	*	You don't want to see what comes up when you hit alt+right on the keyboard.       WAKKA WAKKA WAKKA
t1_dte327f	-0.594300	*	So why would I buy a home if this is going to happen? Makes no sense.
t1_dssao23	-0.531300	*	Are you serious? Have you ever read anything? Have you got eyes and a functioning brain?

t1_dtqgcnx	0.176100	*	Im speachless
t1_dtj2v8u	0.970000	*	Well yes really. I do want better civilisation, and as you know the numbers of homeless has increased in the last few years. That's embarrassing for a 1st world country. 
t1_dt8whpz	0.000000	*	Wise choice.
t1_dt4pxpy	0.000000	*	no thats their market share, they literally make 70% of the world's solar panels its super scary...

t1_dt3gh4t	-0.440400	*	You're more concerned with people down voting you. Got some maturing to do first.
t1_dt6agn8	-0.986400	*	Yes, it is literally, unironically worse than those things. Yes.
t1_dswjr7x	-0.171400	*	so socialism stops being socialism when it stops working? Shitty socialism is still socialism.
t1_dswpqgp	-0.820100	*	Educate me, Einstein. Obviously I know birth control can fail and condoms can break. Show me stats that say that actually happens often.
t1_dthq3jq	-0.723100	*	Yes, of course! But a fetus is human DNA, not some magical other. It is a member of the human species.
t1_dsggkxl	0.340000	*	Because life should follow baseball rules 
t1_dtff16d	0.000000	*	Seriously?!!? ***nazism*** is not right wing by your standards? I dont think that you know what right/left wing even means.
t1_dt5vxi5	0.000000	*	They gave you the LGBT link while you were arguing with this person for providing you sources.  You accused them of making things up and you were proven wrong. Maybe you should apologize.
t1_dtve9fe	0.000000	*	Lol no, money doesn't make you an absolute asshole like this guy. 
t1_dtco3ii	-0.296000	*	The world is fucked, there is really no way out, it is inevitable. Perhaps in my life, probably in my children's and definitely in my grand kids. 
t1_dsl05u7	0.709600	*	Don't have a credible source, like I said, I just got that from the context of other comments and I might be completely wrong haha
t1_dshbak1	-0.726900	*	The one I posted was.  And it doesn't even begin to answer the question of what China would do when we start nuclear strikes on what is effectively their back yard.
t1_dsuazxe	0.571900	*	Because it's obviously a successful model.  The only argument against it is calling it socialism.
t1_dsl76dp	-0.726900	*	LOL I missed that part where you called me a racist.  Yes, when folks like you call people you don't even know (me, for example) racist and sexist, those terms have lost all meaning.
t1_dtrvyvo	0.000000	*	I loled.  It's not really the Quebecois, they have a sense of humor. It's just the Reddit neckbeard Quebecois that doesn't have one.  
t1_dstv3s0	0.000000	*	OK, and your point? It has so much more going for it than bitcoin I wont even list it all. Until it's market cap is more than bitcoin it is cheap lol. 
t1_dt2l072	-0.275500	*	Wouldn't the top layer super-computer be on the hook for providing the energy and processing power for all the layers below? That seems like approaching an infinite amount of energy at some point.
t1_dsmjnj8	0.737800	*	And they found it in an attic in Amsterdam.  Off to Offswitch mit du, naughty refrigerator.
t1_dtqj63k	0.439100	*	Nice jab. Very subtle.    I wouldn't be criticising these assholes if I were like minded.

t1_dtj0bn8	0.361200	*	You can't cite your sources, or maybe you're embarrassed to post Breitbart links. 
t1_dsrux8c	0.458800	*	I was waiting for your moral arbitration. 
t1_dtoj3uj	0.296000	*	Thats a huge part of, and I never said it wasnt. All I said is that Canada and Western Europe have benefitted from the arraignment in a number of ways. 
t1_dsibn9t	-0.257900	*	Tens of millions murdered for political opposition?  No?  Reread: you need to take a profound moral inventiory.
t1_dsyfgw1	-0.275500	*	More than said, they have been demonstrated.
t1_dttp2t0	-0.566400	*	That's exactly the idea.  
t1_dttk64f	0.000000	*	Blimey, you could be right. Before my time though.
t1_dsk5vo4	0.817600	*	The book is taken out of context at best but sadly for you almost entirely false.
t1_dtdfame	0.421500	*	No, now the last one a president didn't attend was the 2017 dinner. Because Trump is a little bitch.
t1_dt7h9y9	0.000000	*	>I mean only one nation on Earth has actually used Nukes ~~in anger...~~ to end a world war avoiding a ground invasion which would have cost many more lives in both sides.  Ftfy  
t1_dtn5zn3	-0.880300	*	Isn't this exactly the same thing as the Obama administration refusing to enforce marijuana and immigration laws?   (For the record, I am pro immigration and marijuana.)
t1_dsrmx6z	0.440400	*	*pronunciation
t1_dskvtsf	-0.921700	*	Lets just go back to the original point though.  You turning down a 100% wage increase is actually fucking stupid as shit.

t1_dt2m382	0.000000	*	Yes.   EDIT: No.
t1_dsl80cn	0.458800	*	Some people like to argue against whatever character in their head would most likely say whatever you said. The rest is assumed and you should just leave it be.

t1_dtawv3e	0.796400	*	Most libertarian country on the planet. Ha. I can tell if youre trolling. Come to Canada dude we will talk freedom.
t1_dt3eqwv	0.526700	*	Youre making sense until the genocide part. Nazi Germany literally tried to wipe out the Jewish race in Europe. To say other countries committed genocide by fighting the war, well thats just ignorant.
t1_dssnazi	0.312500	*	a teacher in my high school actually showed that to his class. he was not a teacher there by the end of the day.

t1_dsdvlyv	-0.644000	*	Yeah, the hypocrisy is insane. This interaction reminded me why I don't go to this sub often. 
t1_dszjd0h	0.250000	*	No, did you? We're talking cost of healthcare. If you can't find the flaw in paying twice per capita than Canada, your neighboring country, then hope is lost.
t1_dt9fkds	-0.530200	*	Came for the Lenin quote, stayed for the comments about rationalizing his motives and  attempts to vindicate *his version of Communism.*
t1_dt5f646	0.000000	*	Which has never been false. We have always paid more. Even when our dollar was the same and even higher for a brief moment we paid more. And businesses made less.
t1_dsdv7at	0.612400	*	Autistic semantics games. They take money out of the US economy and send it to another economy. That helps our country 0.
t1_dsutojs	0.000000	*	Yup it's just a coincidence that it makes sense as an acronym and must just be a mispelling that caught on in the community. FFS do you even hear how ridiculous that sounds? 
t1_dszrkvc	0.000000	*	I've never heard anyone say that before. American-acting implies not American. 
t1_dtproh3	0.000000	*	THEY'RE PUTTING CHEMICALS, IN THE COLA, THAT TURN THE DIABETICS GAY

t1_dtlo887	0.296000	*	So in Canada, the right is blue and the left is red? It's the reverse in the USA.
t1_dsop9b4	0.000000	*	Radioactive clouds probably, dust layer I doubt it. As crazy and terrible H-bombs are they are still farrrrr from this level of destruction.

t1_dt5vd9o	-0.296000	*	Which in itself can be considered an obstruction of justice.
t1_dsv7gb4	0.000000	*	My worldview is being born anew. China dominating will be because they espouse it. Millions of race-blind westerners are increasingly convinced by statistics; everyone else already agrees with me.
t1_dsutxv1	0.750600	*	Probably shouldn't get into politics with your boss if you are diametrically opposed to his beliefs, or if he happens to be a Trump supporter 
t1_dtf68w8	-0.928200	*	He said listen to and believe them, not listen to.  Reading obviously isn't your strong suite, so I understand your confusion.
t1_dswpkdn	0.571900	*	That is not discrimination. Not in the slightest

t1_dsgpj9r	-0.455900	*	Yeah I also think a good regulatory organ is needed for the system to function correctly, I kinda misunderstood your viewpoint and thought you were saying that free markets simply don't work.
t1_dsspxhc	-0.521400	*	Visa and bitcoin are different instruments. One is a currency the other is a card for using a currency. Your relevant comparison is fiat money backed by a government, such as the US dollar.

t1_dtqchz4	-0.989000	*	Just a friendly reminder that as Americans you're no longer under the category of rational actor. In fact, I'm just as worried about the NK dotard pressing the button as I am the US dotard.

t1_dsppwad	0.000000	*	Does that make it a level of appointing ?
t1_dtdub3w	0.153100	*	Exactly.  You can become insanely rich in the west without being corrupt. It's hard to do that in countries with corruption that extends all the way down to everyday life.

t1_dt971nj	0.140600	*	I didn't say it wasn't. I'm saying when people aren't capable of coming up with a good argument they resort to that and that's when you know they have nothing else to say
t1_dshvzr9	0.401900	*	I was a manager for 10 years at a pizza place.  Did your drivers shake the 2 liters of the non tippers too in addition to always delivering them last if there was more than one order ready at a time?

t1_dto3pyh	0.899600	*	He was elected a year ago and done very little. If you think economic growth is because of him you really don't understand economics.

t1_dtrj22o	-0.585900	*	Yeah but it's not a 100% reliable and you have to constantly double-check what you say. You can't be yourself when your family members are on your friend's list.

t1_dt3pnl4	0.611500	*	That's a lie.  The only thing you can't do is buy property. Hundreds of millions rent without the local Hukou, it's perfectly legal.
t1_dtgqh8z	-0.974800	*	Are we currently committing genocide? Is our current foreign policy resulting in a world war? Is the government sponsoring mass killings of our own citizens? Using gas?
