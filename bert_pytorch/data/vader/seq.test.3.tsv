t1_dv24gmh	0.440400	*	Back when the party was created it was to the left of the existing party hence the name. Things have changed but the name remains. 
t1_duvhpar	0.000000	*	because it's unthinkable that US could harm innocent civillians
t1_dupfhyh	0.000000	*	At least the bobsledder makes sense.  I have no idea why that curler was doping.  EDIT: Ah, they are claiming it's a conventional medication that was reclassified in 2016.  Interesting.
t1_dungq9t	-0.381800	*	So killing someone after arresting them becomes justified because other people were killed somewhere else by other people?  You are a sick person.
t1_duoq8s8	0.691600	*	I love that people actually think they can take on predator drones, tanks, jets and the world's most advanced military with small arms like an AR and their untrained buddies.   
t1_dulbnwo	-0.296000	*	Weird because you're not used to it, the vast majority of the world's population would find your culture's mourning rituals weird as well.
t1_duzxryc	-0.765000	*	What does this have to do with liberals? Right wing politics are suddenly liberal when done by Black people? Lol

t1_duyzqk8	-0.897900	*	same reason Hitler is not considered a Socialist politician but got designated his own new category, because that wasn't real Socialism^tm.
t1_dv0xeys	-0.941200	*	Did you even read the article? She's been charged with distributing violent images for posting a picture of a decapitated body
t1_durdru7	0.000000	*	yup the big oil companies won't allow that to happen, hence the shit they are being put through now.

t1_dufmrww	-0.296000	*	I don't understand. How did the plane end up in a position where it would hit a mountain? I'm not familiar with how planes work, so sorry if this is a dumb question.
t1_dubw130	0.153100	*	Isn't the standard pose you take with legs up bad for you? I remember reading about it on reddit front page months ago.

t1_dur5pfy	0.000000	*	IIRC, all flus are antibiotic resistant.   
t1_dur4z7g	0.202300	*	In practical level it might not be foreign money. Was it Gucci HQ from Italy directly or Gucci USA (or whatever their USA subsidiary is) on orders from HQ? Or even Gucci USA on their own initiative.
t1_duq44hs	-0.367000	*	Because that it didn't happen. Crazy huh, that the FBI doesn't investigate conspiracy theories from 4chan. 
t1_dv0wl71	0.440400	*	? Monsanto doesn't have anything to do with neonics. The only thing they use them for is seed treatments and they outsource that to some other company because they don't make them.

t1_duvtf6n	0.000000	*	Anti-trump opinion pieces are exempt from the rules.
t1_duv9yh1	0.698100	*	This has more to do with trash and litter not climate change? Average person that denies climate change wouldnt be convinced until after it happens unfortunately.
t1_duxy0ur	-0.077200	*	Damn, there are a lot of people in this thread who really seem to hate them.  I wonder how many of them are Russian. 
t1_dup1jph	-0.599400	*	The right has all the money, the left is left to eat scraps. No wonder the revolution will be violent.
t1_ducwzxb	-0.296000	*	I voted for Jill Stein and listen to RT every day.  Would be nice if the media would talk about worker's rights instead of this theater. 
t1_dusjcg4	0.421500	*	What they export we import so  Mexicans suffer = Americans suffer   Thats how trade works. 
t1_dv3ysem	0.659700	*	its on death watch because it is really old (45) yrs old or 90 human years. The two females with him are his daughter and grand daughter who've had problems getting pregnant by AI.

t1_dulhvu3	0.000000	*	Help them in their country. Don't invite them to yours. UK and USA top spending on aid. The money goes further and there are no issues with mass migration. Germany should change their approach.

t1_duvvqtd	-0.700300	*	They should try WWIII to prevent global warming :)
t1_dus2erg	0.000000	*	That's all the result of the actions of a single party.   The Republican memo was unprecedented as have been many other recent GOP attempts to subvert truth, the rule of law, and US institutions.

t1_duadyco	0.000000	*	Its Archer all over again 
t1_durx8sd	-0.153100	*	Yup. News flash: Suddenly its time to give a shit about Syria again. Do they require more freedom after all? Stay tuned.

t1_dumnrh7	0.000000	*	Yes. 
t1_dv0nu4o	0.273200	*	It's likely that GB wouldn't be able to export anything grown using these pesticides to the EU so maybe that will cause them to stop?
t1_dv2ybuq	-0.873200	*	Their goal was to create division. 
t1_dubku1z	0.000000	*	That's probably true but they definitely wanted dumbass Trump to be elected.
t1_duelulb	-0.599400	*	How does him being beaten up for being a disgusting pedophile reduce the sentence for his crimes?
t1_dubt52e	-0.226300	*	Yep, if China wants unrestricted access to western markets they should also let western companies have unrestricted access to their own.
t1_dugphh0	0.000000	*	Not a USAian, but wonder if electing trump wasnt more of a 'fuck you' than a 'this is who we want'.
t1_dugl9rk	-0.571900	*	He has dementia. He literally doesn't know what to do. 
t1_duqeznz	-0.718400	*	I'm not American, so excuse me if this is a stupid question...  But doesn't the U.S. usually execute traitors who conspire against the U.S.?  edit: Answer is definitely not
t1_dv1dm3l	0.000000	*	Understand what? Not everyone wants love and peace. War and power have their own place in nature. 
t1_dulmfqq	0.000000	*	Whats one thing hes about thats so terrible?
t1_dukucr6	0.000000	*	I often think about how no one is going to show up at my funeral.  This sounds like a great solution.

t1_duqeznz	0.000000	*	I'm not American, so excuse me if this is a stupid question...  But doesn't the U.S. usually execute traitors who conspire against the U.S.?  edit: Answer is definitely not
t1_duq6l78	0.000000	*	Can we call this scandal Gates-gate?
t1_duog65g	-0.273200	*	> failure to report income to tax  Manafort also jaywalked once and Gates stole a candy bar from a store when he was 4.  
t1_duevq5b	0.202300	*	This was worded in a very misleading way. See below for an alternative:  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/google-fights-proposed-tax-change-to-canadian-online-advertising/article33767092/
t1_dubln18	-0.807000	*	There are a lot of very smart people using Twitter. Much more than Reddit. Some of the smartest and most influential people with important things to say use it daily. I follow scientists, mostly. 
t1_dusfkjq	0.726900	*	You mean you don't want schools to turn into a war zone during school shootings?! B-b-but then when will I ever be able to use muh ar-15?  /s
t1_dug7t54	-0.408200	*	Eh that last part isn't true at all. There are something like 100k Ethiopian Jews in Israel. There was a large military operation to bring them there in the 90s in fact. 
t1_dv2gq19	-0.988600	*	Youre a special kind of stupid.  Did you even read the article?
t1_dur3fkc	0.000000	*	the difficulty is that without security clearance, Ivanka can easily sell information regarding the sanctions to unscrupulous parties for her own personal gain.
t1_duuidw2	0.361200	*	Recently Argentuna captured a spanish fishing boat too.  Edit. I wont correct the typo
t1_dv0l0zd	0.371600	*	That's because in the EU, science and facts can still hold sway.
t1_dua92sz	0.000000	*	It was the DNC's fault Bernie's idea of minority voter outreach was Killer Mike and Cornell West 
t1_duj128k	0.836000	*	The Russian Orthodox Church runs the show over there, alongside Putin

t1_dukygmd	-0.940100	*	I love it when homophobic jokes are only okay when it's a politician you don't like.   See it on facebook too. By fourteen year olds and fifty year old soccer moms. 
t1_duqirnu	-0.557400	*	I honestly wonder what their response would be if Mueller does find solid evidence of collusion.
t1_duqaf5f	0.381800	*	What a strangely verbose way to say But whatabout...
t1_duhyezg	-0.618700	*	The levels are incomparable. US is light years ahead when standard of living is concerned.

t1_dukf3q5	0.000000	*	Its for awareness and protesting the evil drumpf! We are just kidding people into thinking it does anything. 
t1_dunfpz1	0.000000	*	Uh his ban on transgender people being able to serve in the military is a pretty big example.
t1_due8a4k	-0.826800	*	It's like charging someone who sent a mailbomb that went off in America. The crime happened in America, even if the person who did never was on American soil.
t1_dv40bg8	-0.296000	*	In the meantime, their drivers paid them to get there. Brilliant management! /s
t1_duzt8h3	0.636900	*	Much Likely their houses. IDk, I would say they're brazillian, who, you know, **studied geography in the school, as well the constitution of the country**
t1_dv2aqlf	0.000000	*	The Russians these days are super conservative though.
t1_dv48azv	0.592700	*	If an ISP can promise speeds up to 25 mbps and I only get 6 then I should be able to promise up to $60 per month but only pay $14. 
t1_dupav8g	-0.557400	*	This is clap trap, you're leaving out far too much information to come to that conclusion and you are drawing conclusions that are too broad anyway.
t1_duhvkjt	0.000000	*	Yes these new fangled cash machines are putting all the bank tellers out of work...
t1_duktkuo	0.000000	*	Thanks for saying what I was too lazy to type. Even as an atheist I still see the benefits of religious studies from a geopolitical viewpoint 
t1_duovqy9	0.827100	*	Yeah, people who have a different political ideology than you should be bound and beaten!
t1_duxw54l	0.153100	*	 ufe0f Warning to mobile users, this website is AIDS
t1_duija7t	-0.827100	*	Yup, and while we learn to be buddy-buddy with NK, they continue to torture their own civilians to the brink of starvation and suicide.  It's a win-win, apparently.
t1_dv1c8j3	0.153100	*	Don't worry this guy will just blame the crash on Obama.
t1_dujj3ym	0.000000	*	The collusion he is denying is in regards to them meddling with the election.   So yes, he did deny it. 
t1_durbkbe	-0.884500	*	It was a scam all along. No refugee would ever want to resettle in Cambodia of all places.
t1_dux5now	0.000000	*	no no, anything lower then euro 4 is already banned from almost all city centers. this would bann everything under euro 6 from city centers, entire citys and even small towns!
t1_duaimhl	0.403300	*	I wonder if it could be applied really fast.  Maybe someone could design spraypaint can nozzles that spray in the shape of Navalny so it's just a quick spray-and-run.
t1_ducfk2w	-0.947700	*	WHO and Oxfam are suddenly finding themselves in a different kind of disaster zone.
t1_dulv2rw	0.000000	*	I was just thinking, this dude needs to be careful or he'll end up being murdered.
t1_dv00nq6	-0.128000	*	Can illegals not have a valuable trade? Are illegals a certain color?

t1_duep4jq	0.000000	*	Out of curiosity, why wouldnt it be?
t1_duzdshk	-0.599400	*	And the USA has been in war posture for......?
t1_dupn3o1	-0.476700	*	That's true. But it should also be mentioned that German productivity is not God given. Germany went through some pretty harsh reforms in the early 2000s.
t1_duz3cs6	-0.904200	*	The best airport I've ever seen is Toronto, the worst is Havanah. The US literally has airports like a third world country.
t1_dv47v87	0.000000	*	Not even third world -- they often have better infrastructure because they'd skipped over the antiquated copper wires right to 4g
t1_dv4qxsm	0.361200	*	this is the first I'm hearing about that, can you tell me more. Genuinely curious
t1_dv0l5wh	-0.373600	*	holy fuck, sorry to hear this. Are people just having to birth at home??   I wish you and everyone else the best of luck and that you have a great rest of the week. 
t1_duns2hg	0.000000	*	Make a thread out of this or I will

t1_duqk53c	0.401900	*	They can't convict a husband and wife for the same crime!  I have the worst fucking lawyers!

t1_dv012wt	-0.966200	*	No blacks in America actually want to go back to Africa.
t1_dubtd74	0.202300	*	It's funny because everyone's so dependent on China now that sanctions will be shooting themselves in the foot - and probably only increase China's influence via the rest of the world. 
t1_ducohio	-0.373600	*	Interesting that it says they wanted to spread damaging info on Hillary, Rubio, and Cruz. No Trump. 
t1_dute7i4	0.214400	*	Yes. Let's remove the separation of church and state. By taxing churches you are giving them the right to have a say in what the money is used for.
t1_dunld94	0.093000	*	Not sure if you noticed but tuna sushi is popular all over the world by people of all races, not just the Japanese. The obstacle is to convince a majority that a certain food must not be consumed.
t1_durbkbe	0.431000	*	It was a scam all along. No refugee would ever want to resettle in Cambodia of all places.
t1_dv0af97	0.827100	*	This is the top of the Banff Gondola. You can hike the trail (highly recommend) but it's steep, and there is usually a few bears on the way up.

t1_dv0ds3o	-0.771700	*	Well, tbh, those weapons let the world be quite peaceful last 70+ years.

t1_duawlob	-0.526700	*	Foreign controlled opposition you mean? Dude is a western stooge.
t1_dugopm6	0.000000	*	17 year old though. We don't have a fully developed frontal cortex until age 25 even.
t1_dun4vql	0.000000	*	No one knows I'm a dog? I know you tried to use Google translate though. The word you're looking for is cyka.
t1_dudi9fe	0.000000	*	No, I don't think they are. I think he's looking at Russian interference in the American election system.  
t1_dv60cv3	0.421500	*	China sounding fair and balanced and working to achieve multinational cooperation against a dictator. Dear god, how the tables have turned.

t1_duyixem	-0.787700	*	All of these sources lmfao  CNN, WaPo, HuffPost, Vox, Daily Mail, & Twitter. I'm crying, all these *reliable* news sources all get caught lying every day. Surprised I don't see AP on here.

t1_dugmdlf	0.000000	*	If this is supposed to be a Nazi comparison, it's not very accurate, and pretty clearly racist against Germans.
t1_dulm856	-0.169500	*	Really sounds like Japan wants to get their hands in while the corruption is affordable. Once they have their equipment and some favors in their belt they can further influence the elections.
t1_dv4fdyl	0.542300	*	Sure there is.  The Russians want him and the US want him.  Based on declarations by the judge, the US will probably win.
t1_duhoke0	0.000000	*	Canada would win, easily. Just send a couple of Nova Scotians and we're gold.
t1_dul8ky6	0.000000	*	Can't they get training from a country with an actually well-regarded police force like the UK or Scandinavia? Rather than US Army II- Jackboot Boogaloo?

t1_duvdrnn	0.240100	*	Well, the idea of an illegal protest is bad enough. The duck is just the icing on the cake.
t1_dv3m7yj	0.000000	*	Where do you live, looking to relocate from this weird dystopia
t1_dudizae	0.000000	*	What's with you guys? Here we have the greatest legal team ever assembled prosecuting people for their crimes and here you are disparaging them online.
t1_dv3wc4l	0.153100	*	Isn't it sad that for some people, the best way to get by is to rabidly defend the government that's to blame for their life sucking so much?
t1_duph5po	-0.273200	*	They use a lot of coal power plants, 40%+ of electricity comes from coal.  Renewable sources do not really replace coal but rather nuclear.
t1_ducr63p	0.421500	*	Because, frankly, Reddit isn't as relevant as people here think it is.
t1_dul5qsr	0.128000	*	That's not how it works. It's like saying I ordered a PC but the graphics card isn't working very well, but meh, never mind, I paid for it
t1_duphm34	0.038200	*	Meanwhile, America announced it'll run a $1,000,000,000,000 deficit. Yes. 12 zeros. In one fucking year.

t1_dv46n1f	0.000000	*	I mean brexit hasn't really happened yet so we don't really know to what extent Brexit will affect the UK or EU yet.  Also the US has been hurting itself since it voted for Trump. 
t1_dur84am	0.000000	*	Unless you want to repeal one of the original amendments of the constitution, you're not banning semiautomatic rifles. The solution is really not that simple.

t1_dulbc2l	0.000000	*	That was my thought... Liver and Onions is my favorite meal. Liver is less than a dollar a pound. A peach can cost $2.50. wtf?

t1_dv3hj8r	-0.880500	*	Yup.  Kinda sad.  Easier to believe that Russia is trying to trick you than to admit your odeas were rejected.

t1_dumvsz3	-0.594000	*	You just called people idiots but implied that comments by a Russian troll in Time is the reason this is true. No, a 37 page indictment with facts and evidence is what makes it true.    
t1_dunx9fb	0.000000	*	Because children tend to be at higher risk of dying from school shootings?
t1_duucuwb	0.000000	*	Yes, the explanation could be anything. The correlation doesn't prove that coffee has health benefits. For example, the people who don't drink coffee might drink more alcohol.
t1_dv1zmd9	-0.887500	*	Agreed, how can you send someone to war at 18 but not allow them to own a gun or drink....   You aren't old enough to own this gun, but you are old enough to shoot it at another human sober.

t1_duz0dx1	-0.648600	*	In this case it may be. She is involved with all the big shots in Russian politics. Who knows what went down in the past.
t1_duh9p2w	0.718400	*	My first thought when I looked at the photo. Just the way the guys around her are all creepy looking and smiling 
t1_duir29l	0.000000	*	Yeah, and he's gonna eat all the bananas.

t1_duvy1p5	0.318200	*	*playing violin in the background
t1_dukwx94	0.599400	*	im not russian but I totally get why Russians do this. it's pretty damn fun to watch americans get angry at each other. and american politics is as entertaining as politics gets. no offense. 
t1_dv0gshd	0.401900	*	Hold up. LA Times and the Independent are sensational, but Daily Wire, a blatantly, unapologetically conservative news source ISN'T?  Please explain.

t1_dubtd74	0.510000	*	It's funny because everyone's so dependent on China now that sanctions will be shooting themselves in the foot - and probably only increase China's influence via the rest of the world. 
t1_duji490	0.025800	*	Umm we don't get to do that..

t1_dudjo7x	0.000000	*	Its like the corporations are taking advantage at our lack of govt regulated drug prices or something, but thats **impossible** because we have a free competitive market that fixes all that. /s
t1_duq5u63	-0.130200	*	That was not even Russia's intent.  They just want the West in such chaos, partisan dead lock, and fake news that we're unable to coalesce to effectively counter Russia's global hegemony ambitions.
t1_duv5n7l	0.273200	*	Would have thought AWS is bigger
t1_dv4a5er	0.612400	*	Sounds like the U.S. during a peaceful protest. Peaceful until cops start fucking people up, obviously. 
t1_dursqu7	-0.296000	*	There are sanctions in place on the DPRK, enforcing those sanctions is legal.  Who is going to do anything about it? The USN has the second largest air force in the world after the USAF.
t1_dusrbpb	-0.440400	*	here's the thing: you can be anti-Hitler and _also_ anti-Stalin. in fact, back in the day, before it got bumraped by an orange clown, this was kind of America's USP.

t1_dua4lpl	0.000000	*	Everyone does have fists. People still get punched in high school. What do you think would happen if every high schooler had a gun? Probably fewer shooting sprees, but a LOT more random murders.
t1_dv06urg	0.000000	*	Also? They're the only ones.
t1_duyzoh1	-0.226300	*	There has been 22 indictments since the Russian investigation started by Mueller. The fact you people still believe that anyone actually believes this nothingburger argument is hilarious. 
t1_dv0jun8	-0.421500	*	Sure, used in plastic surgery all the time.
t1_duetvxc	-0.571900	*	Lol yep. I got banned for asking a question that wasn't even very critical of Trump.
t1_dupngd4	0.895200	*	It's always fun to expand a comment sitting at -24 votes only to find that it's not a troll or something like that, but simply someone with an unpopular opinion.  It's not an I disagree button!

t1_duc84zf	0.000000	*	apparently they can live in the white house so I would say yes.

t1_dudq0q3	0.918500	*	I live in Chicago and saw it with an overwhelmingly black audience and had the same experience.  Don't tell Joe Rogan.  He's very sensitive about this sort of thing.
t1_dujspxs	-0.401900	*	Not Australian but I'm guessing this like a Alberta-restofCanada/Catalonia-restofSpain sort of beef in that you feel more tax revenue is going out than coming in?

t1_duyk7s8	0.000000	*	If nothing else, this is pretty much hard proof Mueller is officially targetting Trump.   Will he find anything? Who knows, but at least that's what he's *trying* to do.
t1_dv0hm5m	0.381800	*	Most likely not. 
t1_dupa9kl	-0.493900	*	>No one take us into consideration, they treated us like we were subhuman  They attacked a joint command post with a Marine artillery base to their flank. This is a very unfortunate position to be in.

t1_duvlkv0	-0.670500	*	But how do we, as in human race, stop it?
t1_dudg5ab	-0.361200	*	This is a different faction. The SDF, and it's main component, the YPG, are not part of that main bloc of rebels which you are reffering to who have often claimed similar.

t1_duk7y1q	0.476700	*	One difference in my mind is that there has been virtually no movement in the peace process since Oslo (90s).   The NAFTA stuff... is just empty posturing. 
t1_dv2zt6v	0.855500	*	I havent seen any reports of Russians peddling pro-Clinton material. Pro-Bernie, anti-Clinton? Yes. But Clinton was the one candidate they did not want.

t1_dv2fwqh	0.612400	*	You are correct, but the new argument is that NASA shouldnt be doing the research.  I have given up trying to convince the ignorant.

t1_duj8yq2	0.000000	*	When the Israeli ambassador was slated to speak about it (they've kinda got that tech down well) the people rioted and shut it down, because the country basically is 100% pro Palestine.

t1_dv1d76f	-0.700300	*	That and the EU threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Florida specifically. A state without which he would surely lose reelection.

t1_dulv952	-0.292400	*	Yeah... In medical literature. So if a doctor recommends you an alcohol limit it will be in units, usually one unit equals about a 250ml beer or a modest glass of wine.
t1_dupqpsd	-0.340000	*	But South Sudan won its war against the muslim Sudan to become independent and now theyre massacring each other when theyre largely animist and christian.   You cant blame Islam for this.

t1_dumrpw0	0.848100	*	A well armed Japan can be argued keeps the peace in the region.  Having everyone armed to the teeth does seem frightening, but seems to be the best way to keep some countries from attacking others.

t1_dubyc1z	-0.690800	*	It is. Without getting too political about it, say what you want about China - but the capability to plan and actually execute projects like this is rather jawdropping.
t1_dup6vj2	-0.851900	*	1. Trump is an idiot. 2. Studies so far have shown the exact opposite. Agression and violence exposure in media reduces agression in general.

t1_dukht2b	-0.831600	*	I doubt this will save many lives. If anything it's just Trump trying to appeal the masses.

t1_dugscvp	0.571900	*	Just a preface: I'm Australian, not American. But from what I saw of your electon from here, I don't think it's that everyone wanted trump, it's that they were voting not hillary.
t1_duhv0nm	-0.158100	*	They say that if you don't vote then there will be a law that you have to accept lonely gay people in your family and even sleep with them. Not homophobic at all.

t1_dued03n	0.283100	*	Processing nuts for milk is pretty resource-intensive. Also, no matter how it tastes, nut milk has a very different nutrition profile than cow milk. And just try making cheese or yoghurt from it.
t1_dug3gpi	-0.051600	*	I mean everyone just takes out a student loan for the tuition anyways. If they succeed and get a job with this high value degree, all it means is some money going out of their salary?

t1_duhztd7	-0.296000	*	No he is Bill gates. 
t1_dulke0h	0.177900	*	It's probably a symptom of mass immigration into Europe.
t1_dutgbsf	-0.981500	*	I'm inclined to think so too - obviously a lot of speculation that this could be a terrorist attack however seems like a fairly innocuous target. 
t1_dug77e3	0.670500	*	Not to start any conspiracies, but this is also roughly the amount that was recently hacked from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitgrail U0001f914

t1_dv0fu2o	-0.605400	*	The trick is to go, but then not steal land from the native inhabitants and expect no repercussion at any point in history. But try explaining this to a white person, they think piracy is a religion.

t1_dv234k4	-0.361200	*	The NRA is actually an interesting case because they throw around a lot of power without a whole lot of money. It turns out an army of single-issue voters is more effective than cash.
t1_dusyzg4	0.000000	*	Considering adding fresh water to salt water is not going to make the salt water acidic. Climate change seems like not the source.   My guess would be industrial pollution.

t1_duabne7	0.440400	*	Congo. Eastern Ukraine. The Rohingya genocide in Myanmar. Not sure if they'd count Mexico? Certain parts of Thailand and the Philippines? But the statistic is probably bogus. 
t1_duy488f	0.421500	*	You're not wrong, but Korea does it as well. They still deny that their soldiers raped Vietnamese women in the Vietnam war.

t1_duugvjq	-0.879000	*	OK, let's wait a few more years and see what happens in the Philippines, shall we, before passing judgment?   What's the drug addiction rate in Singapore, by the way?

t1_dullws9	0.000000	*	I was like wow this Carl Vinson guy must be important if people call him THE Carl Vinson. Then I realized he is probably a boat
t1_dujnj8r	0.421500	*	and he denied collusion, and he denied that collusion is illegal, and he said that if he colluded it still didn't affect the election, etc...  Trump is a liar.
t1_durnyet	0.000000	*	5000 years, sure. Even Arabs as such barely exist for 2000 years, nevermind Syrian civilization
t1_duq6pps	0.733900	*	More perfect, by the radiolab folks, did a great show about how the NRA changed in the 1960s and 70s. The episode name is The Gun Show. 
t1_dusgch1	0.421500	*	??? It's already being built. They're throwing up a 2mile wall to test structural integrity and proof of concept literally right now. He had almost 10 prototypes he was looking at 2 months ago.

t1_duf5qh5	0.051600	*	>because they're a hateful group, desperately looking for ammunition to justify their beliefs.  This is what Russian propaganda looks like now.  People making irrational us vs them statements.  
t1_duzv58k	0.000000	*	How is it racism?  edit: I haven't said that it wasn't racism, I'm just asking how. Everyone is telling me I'm an idiot instead of giving a good explanation (which should be easy if I'm that stupid).

t1_dul4r6d	0.000000	*	They're pushing both sides of the debate. You'd have to have a quantum superposition of less gun restrictions and more gun restrictions to satisfy them.

t1_dudr488	-0.425700	*	The real question is why does insurance pay for it, not why are they charging that much.
t1_duilq6h	0.474000	*	You underestimate UK taxation. It starts at 32% on earnings above 10k, and ramps up to 52% above 40k.

t1_duj50om	0.134100	*	Extraditions like that rarely ever happen though. No country in Europe wants to deal with the disaster of having extradited a Russian citizen to the US, a well connected billionaire nonetheless.
t1_dv1hd17	0.190100	*	Yeah, but there is no doubt the US would pay a heavy price to take out North Korea. Even if by some miracle we didn't lost many men, the cost of the war would be astronomical.

t1_duqm5bo	0.639200	*	Yeah the NRA sponsoring gun safety and firearms training makes us look super unhinged.  It's a pro gun lobbying group.  Don't be shocked when they are against gun control.

t1_dul6p0g	0.458800	*	Russians also tried disinformation warfare during the cold war. The reason why its so effective today is internet social media giving the Russians direct access to the American psyche.

t1_dunbgkd	-0.624900	*	Nobody said to arm any/all teachers. The suggestion, not made by the President as OP stated, was to give designated teachers who are screened and trained the option of carrying a weapon.

t1_duafc45	0.000000	*	Yeah, cos everyone here on Reddit chooses to go down to their local bookstore or strip mall and support their local business owners instead of buying online. Lel.

t1_duxe589	0.492700	*	I sincerely hope you're right, because this whole attitude the country has has always seemed wildly effective at slowly drowning out dissent over time.

t1_duwh57i	-0.226300	*	>How about we only let people have kids when they prove they can take care of them?  How are they supposed to do that if they don't have kids yet?
t1_duws629	0.682800	*	Theres no such thing as reverse racism, its just racism. In any case, the expropriation of South African land doesnt necessarily mean racism. 
t1_dugpr2w	0.000000	*	What the odds some of that laundered money went through Trump organizations?

t1_duxztn9	0.340000	*	They just introduced a bill that would ban semi-autos in the US. It's nice the anti-gun people finally showed their true colors so we can see them for the snakes they are. 
t1_dugscvp	-0.670500	*	Just a preface: I'm Australian, not American. But from what I saw of your electon from here, I don't think it's that everyone wanted trump, it's that they were voting not hillary.
t1_duszeo9	0.000000	*	You still have elections though.
t1_duspfdp	0.666300	*	Doubtful, the officials were interviewed under lobby terms, meaning that in return for anonymity, they give their honest opinions

t1_duji17o	-0.296000	*	I dont believe they interfered, Trump said.  Every time he sees me, he says, I didn't do that,  Trump said. And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.  
t1_due8v1s	0.475400	*	Would they have to take a direct flight?   Cuba is a long way to travel directly, and if for some reason the plane malfunctions they may have to land in US friendly countries.

t1_dugphh0	0.000000	*	Not a USAian, but wonder if electing trump wasnt more of a 'fuck you' than a 'this is who we want'.

t1_dv18nrh	-0.381800	*	I could have sworn there was a 15k+ upvoted story on this not 12 hours ago...  /r/worldnews says there's nothing to see here I guess. Insane this isn't garnering further coverage or dialog. 
t1_duwmwjl	0.837600	*	Its Couillard.   Never miss an occasion to put emphasis on the Couill because couille means testicle which is appropriate.
t1_dui2r2i	-0.226300	*	Also the upper middle class and anyone making a couple hundred thousand dollars salary. Income tax really hits mid to high salary people hard
t1_ducp6j5	0.000000	*	What were the ramifications of the DNC manipulating the media and cheating in the primary?  Exactly.  Hillary lost all on her own, get over it.

t1_dulhib4	0.700300	*	That's a tough load to swallow, but it's the truth. Russia didn't create these divides, they merely exploited them. We've been setting ourselves up for this shit for decades now. The problem is...us.
t1_dv206r4	0.690800	*	I am confident that not a single word of what he is doing gets leaked unless he says it does.  This is literally the best legal team that has ever been assembled.
t1_duumw08	0.743000	*	agreed. A study is not a research with double blind groups. They need to pick two groups of people with otherwise the same habits, give them coffee or placebo and check who got less ill in the time. 
t1_duq9nrq	-0.913500	*	Came into the thread expecting deflection from this very problem and I'm pleasantly shocked to see that yours is the top comment.

t1_dui16cn	0.929900	*	You know, billionaires didn't get rich by taking money from you or other poor people.   Bill did it by creating and running a company that sells software. Why would you want to stop that?

t1_dux9f0c	0.000000	*	I don't think America welcomes these people. No one cares for them unfortunately. Very hard for them to leave South Africa.

t1_dv2jazm	0.077200	*	To be fair a majority of us didn't vote for him. We are basically left with violent revolution as the only means to fix our very broken system.
t1_dv0bk0s	-0.886000	*	Did you go to school? When you make a claim like that you need to explain yourself.
t1_dua5e5e	-0.718400	*	They are counting any time a fun is fired near a school... including suicides, accidental discharges, stray rounds, etc.  Aka.... bullshit propaganda.

t1_duevgha	0.000000	*	I can hear all the accents whilst reading this
t1_dv2gri6	0.837700	*	The decision was correct, though. If you treat corporations like people, they should have the rights of people.   The problem is treating corporations like people. That needs to be stopped. 
t1_dv09yil	0.077200	*	I dont understand this. The boss gets paid a lot more than you so it makes sense that they work more. Why would you work as hard as the boss for less pay.

t1_duq5u63	-0.128000	*	That was not even Russia's intent.  They just want the West in such chaos, partisan dead lock, and fake news that we're unable to coalesce to effectively counter Russia's global hegemony ambitions.

t1_duk5heb	-0.967400	*	The Russians got caught doping at the Paralympic. Let that sink in. They're not picky when it comes to which athletes should dope, winning is winning in their eyes.

t1_dueou4c	-0.659700	*	Why on earth would anybody do that? All those people having to shoot their own meat would lead to too few ducks and rabbits in the woods.
t1_dv460ax	0.000000	*	> Putin is so smug right now. Gets to laugh at everyone while he embezzles from his country and runs the mob.  Yes, CNN told me so.

t1_duji56f	0.509500	*	I don't know, as a history buff I think it is weird to think that the Germans don't have the scariest tanks on the battlefield.   Make way puny American tanks, make way
t1_dudc9s0	-0.241100	*	Legend. I have a question - is this possibly related to increased activity in the Ring of Fire recently? Thanks for your work as ever.
t1_ducew5s	0.708500	*	It's almost like they aren't worried about any outside threats.

t1_duotsb6	-0.177900	*	Just curious, do you identify as Jewish or Muslim? Your parents seem like quite the atypical pairing.
t1_duyezdf	-0.153100	*	Pretty much. But also when your adversaries are going to take advantage of the bozo in the White House, what choice do you have but to follow along? 
t1_dusetnt	0.000000	*	> not select or sort articles based on any opinions or perceived biases  This bot would be banned from t_d so fast.

t1_duzwij9	-0.340000	*	Lol gun owners are militant extremists now
t1_dunmiq0	0.592700	*	I've never been to a McDonald's that uses foam packaging whatsoever. There's a Wendy's in my town that uses plastic cups but that's the closest we've got.

t1_duszrsk	0.126300	*	Truly the stupidest argument, if you think you and your shitty AR15 stand a chance against any government in the world you are a complete fool. This is just a shit argument from gun apologists.
t1_dua7332	0.401900	*	I found it funny how only ars reported it from a techy viewpoint. So many clickbait titles across the interwebs

t1_due31uv	-0.273200	*	I don't think that logic holds much water. The intelligence they have would be damaging if the US got a hold of them. It would be Russia's best interest they never find their way to the U.S.

t1_dusbxcn	-0.476700	*	They've been building reserves because they expect the US dollar to collapse

t1_dupa14a	-0.128000	*	Well I think Bisexual Asian Studies should have its own building. The question is who goes, the math department or the hockey team?
t1_duujynl	0.000000	*	Ecuador's relationship with China is pretty sad. China owns all the Ecuadorian oil they can produce in the next 10 years or something

t1_duykogp	0.641900	*	Electric cars do not produce a lot of particulate matter (regarding the tires, yes they do) at the location where they are used. It's the exhausts that harm buildings and people's health.

t1_dur8p2a	-0.668800	*	I think this is the wrong attitude. Individuals absolving themselves of any blame due to 'just following orders' has lead to some of the worst war crimes in history being committed.
