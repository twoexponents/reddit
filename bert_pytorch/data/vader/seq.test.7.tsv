t1_duvkpcc	0.915600	*	Kinda weird when you think about it.  Allah is down with a kind of interspecies sex but not with homosexuality?
t1_duz3k0s	-0.690800	*	Not when these two women manage to just vanish without a trace. Untraceable kidnapping and never hear from them again. Russian govt is scary as shit.
t1_dv1550j	-0.993200	*	Just for the record, Saudi has never done that. In fact It's been decades since someone was executed for adultery at all
t1_duizs4i	-0.718400	*	So you would rape a man? Or is heterosexual sex equals raping women now? You just confused me further!
t1_dugpweo	0.227800	*	Forces candidates to appeal to the whole country and not just 3 or 4 cities. Most of the country benefits from the system.

t1_dv39g77	-0.953100	*	Maybe you should make comments that aren't fucking stupid if you don't wanted to be downvoted to oblivion then.
t1_dusonc8	0.493900	*	Do American corporations pay taxes or do consumers when the tax is passed on to them? Does that make taxing corporations a horribly regressive tax on consumers?

t1_dunt36e	0.421500	*	Why? 
t1_duypcq3	0.000000	*	Okay, sure.  I don't care what he does with his free time.  But hiring prostitutes to piss on your bed is salacious regardless of how much respect you have for what people do in their private life.

t1_dudhh7r	-0.585900	*	AR just means Armalite. There's and AR shotgun that's an AR-something. I forget the number. Gun Jesus has a good video on it

t1_duow62p	-0.510600	*	Depending on what you're caring out. You can't recycle paper products that have foods on them. The grease and the like interferes with the recycling process.
t1_dui8cko	0.000000	*	Nobody actually paid that rate. Everything was deductible back then. 
t1_dv4yllz	0.128000	*	Yep. That's why all of us need to go out and vote against every.single.GOP.candidate in 2018. Dems retake the house and Senate and they can actually impeach his ass before the house is just ash.
t1_duqkpct	0.767200	*	Unless in cases of impeachment. In which, Trump will be tried for his crimes and sentenced. However, Trump can avoid being sentenced by resigning, but everyone else still takes the fall. 
t1_dv0pmrp	0.000000	*	Coming over here, giving us metalworking and fancy pots. Who do they think they are! 
t1_duotzy7	0.000000	*	There used to be a guy who'd occasionally do drug math. He once calculated that Warren Buffet could buy a enough cocaine to make a 747 out of cocaine.
t1_ducny2f	0.636900	*	Pretty weird how the land of the free imprisons a greater percentage of its population than any nation in history eh? Free to follow our corporate overlords perhaps, but not free in any true sense

t1_duowpw8	0.000000	*	You could smoke it a lot faster. 
t1_dv017z5	-0.340000	*	I don't think you'd get as much PR for going to Africa to defend white people from black people. Honestly can you picture that? Strikes me as a pretty hard sell.
t1_dv40k27	0.025800	*	Useless, except for being the only source of effective production and intelligent design in the entire known universe...
t1_dv3wta8	0.000000	*	I don't see any way to justify $3/hr median with a company that routinely recruits for $20-$30/hr

t1_dutigwy	-0.340000	*	Elites aren't good at science, scientists are.  It's stupid people thinking they understand more than scientists, even the elites fall for this trap.
t1_dv34syc	0.421500	*	Initially 4chan was the recruiting area. They further expanded to reddit.
t1_dv4cze9	0.000000	*	It's not a requirement of Islam . It is considered Sunnah (tradition of the prophet ) not fard (obligatory duty) .
t1_dud2d48	0.580300	*	Well yes, yes he is. That's the story, Russia paid millions to get Trump elected.   How are you disputing this?

t1_duyqak2	0.502300	*	he fumbled words but it came off like an average person just fumbling a weird sentence. Trump has the diction of a 5th grader and speaks with full confidence. it's different 
t1_dugcly4	0.599400	*	Not that border though.
t1_dujqefi	-0.542300	*	1984, Brave New World and Idiocracy have collided to form our current reality.

t1_dulpe1j	0.000000	*	I agree simply handing money to them without trying to integrate them into our system is a bad idea. But simply shrugging and ignoring human misery isn't a solution either.

t1_duuv5fx	-0.262600	*	What exactly do they fear? This baffles me time and again. We live in the most propserous and safe times ever in our western democracies. What is there to fear?
t1_dulmx62	-0.850400	*	unless you use that economy for supporting a proper public education system. So you'll have later lots of professionals who happened to be born somewhere else.

t1_dupkrxu	0.953500	*	All the Muslims I know, who actually acknowledge that they are one, do not drink. Its like if I was a free market capitalist but then believed in a social welfare state. Then Im not the former.
t1_duf73by	0.296000	*	If the proof was that substantial, then the judge would have refused bail due to the risk to the public. 
t1_duhyre0	0.891400	*	Except its wildly sustainable in the countries that implement it right, and brexit was not an anti-socialist movement.   What a weakass reply. 
t1_dujepd2	0.000000	*	Man there was a recent string of brutal murders of lesbians. One was even literally set on fire. This stuff still happens. You're wrong to say it's over. 
t1_dusknwc	0.000000	*	He only won because Hilary was hated among her own party. So many people are hopefully gonna be more motivated to vote next election to make sure the cheetoh doesn't get reelected.

t1_ducrpdn	0.177900	*	You are seeing their active attempts at disinformation here, you're talking to someone who's not stateside
t1_ductadv	-0.458800	*	Lol well they certainly seem to waste a lot of time fumbling around making mistakes.  >Have you not learned anything from the last 5 months?  That Mueller and comey belong in prison
t1_dur4he0	-0.077200	*	Please tell me how it would be feasible to suddenly relocate and house and feed 30 million people. It's honestly a stupid idea.
t1_dujmtew	0.690800	*	There is no reproducible study that shows vaccines cause autism. The conflicting conclusion only exists in the minds of anti-vaxxers and their bogus publications.
t1_dui84ax	0.000000	*	Agreed. I think you both make good points though.
t1_dv53bis	0.351100	*	Even worse, straight and lesbian women are protected,  gay men are not.   if there was an aids vaccine and it was withheld specifically so that gay people keep dying in droves there'd be outrage,

t1_dudr9va	-0.476700	*	No its regulating.  Government here in Canada doesn't pay for prescription drugs yet they still set prices for them. It has nothing to do with bulk purchases.

t1_dugaz49	0.025800	*	For sure. But that doesn't mean society has to be. We don't create nature, but we certainly create society. Injustices only exist because enough of us accept them.

t1_duqfm09	0.636900	*	I think thats good. People underestimate how long 15 years is. Here in the US, were quick to demand life in prison and anything else seems too short. 15 years is a damn long time though.

t1_dv34sxj	-0.393100	*	It used to be a fun subreddit that I would recommend to people over reddit as a whole, but with conspiracy thought in general it has become less fun and more propaganda against the US.
t1_dv2pdxr	-0.418400	*	Yes, I am. Im not expecting them to be lifted as quickly this time. I thought that was clear from my initial comment about not understanding the consequences. 
t1_duq9kvi	0.000000	*	The GOP was told Russia was interfering by Obama. The GOP refused to cooperate with Dems to create bi-partisan actions to stop the Russians. The GOP has a scorched earth policy.

t1_dunl27a	0.440400	*	Plastic bags are too heavy to carry for long distance if they break. This depends from place to place I think.

t1_duykd1j	0.381800	*	Saying that some piece of evidence is the smoking gun is far different than saying Trump is for sure finished this time.  And it's pretty true there has been quite a few smoking guns already.

t1_durglew	-0.202300	*	It comes in yards?
t1_dv38yfu	0.000000	*	That comparison fails when you consider its an outdoor rally. Once you see the torches and the Heil Hitler salutes, it's time to get out of dodge or accept that you're on the same team. No excuses.

t1_dul3fuc	0.000000	*	Thinking that history just moves in one direction ineluctably is delusionally anti-naturalistic.  I am indeed showing a well-adjusted consideration of the world we live in there.

t1_duzxnk5	-0.574000	*	Maybe they shouldn't have set up an oppressive and brutal apartheid state and then maintained that state until the end of the 20th century - there might be less tension if that hadn't happened.  
t1_duspwgs	-0.786900	*	Trump had a Democratic approval rating in the single digits when he assumed office which is also unprecedented.  
t1_duxkotu	-0.665200	*	No, since it's talking about holding a particular office in the church... Basically women can't be elders.

t1_dv2l30w	0.000000	*	Clinton really wasn't a good choice either.  Better than Trump for sure, but that election forced us to decide between two candidates who were pretty big steps down from Obama.

t1_dv2l30w	0.831600	*	Clinton really wasn't a good choice either.  Better than Trump for sure, but that election forced us to decide between two candidates who were pretty big steps down from Obama.
t1_dus4pw7	0.634400	*	I always knew something like this could happen, and you just confirmed it for me. It's not surprising, but more and more it eroded my faith in the government.

t1_dub2v20	0.000000	*	> How does it feel knowing you have been foiled by a Y chromosome?   How does it feel to care so much? Like really. I can't wrap my head around why people like you would care so much.

t1_dulhhqq	0.000000	*	did you just ignore the marshall plan and subsequent events since? did the US do anything like that to rebuild vietnam?
t1_duj3qmo	-0.757900	*	Ah yes, especially the whole accident of swallowing polonium in your tea. Or running through a window to commit suicide. Or committing suicide by stabbing yourself several times in the chest and arms.
t1_duc5dmn	0.000000	*	Here in Germany, it is common knowledge that the Nazis tried to kill everyone who was different in the Camps. 
t1_dv0u2l1	0.000000	*	Either way, I'm glad you spoke your mind. Nice to have some regular Russian citizens here :)

t1_dupfx3e	-0.441700	*	As Putin actively works to destroy democracies all over the world and dumps every dime he can get his hands on into his military.....could you be any more naive? 
t1_dv37pzd	0.516000	*	Then he just does all of his heinous shit on Tuesdays when we're not allowed to talk about it?  FOH with that bullshit.
t1_duhp17x	0.000000	*	Agree!  I feel like most people don't understand how much money and opportunities our military actually gives people... This thread just shows it too. 
t1_duf76vg	0.571900	*	If something is still profitable even after being caught, convicted, and fined... then it's not a punishment, *it's a tax*.
t1_duee13o	0.102700	*	Because you said the solution would be to produce them in the USA. I believe the solution from the chinese side would be rather to just exclude the USA entirely.
t1_duhpetk	0.296000	*	Sounds like a typical white guy orientalizing more than any kind of objective analysis of chinese people or their culture.
t1_dum5f8r	-0.156600	*	They were only targeting people I like! seems to line up really well with the recent articles that elaborate on how many on the Right fell for this kind of propaganda.

t1_dv095dt	0.353200	*	Except the sins of the father ARE being passed on. 72% of land belong to whites, a 10% minority.  Imagine if 72% of the U.S. economy were in black hands. And it was taken from whites. 
t1_dup9oc6	-0.709600	*	How does it follow that if you assault one political ideology you should assault them all? 
t1_duzcydh	0.805500	*	How does that logic work?  More lanes should mean less cars on a specific lane, assuming the amount of cares stays the same.
t1_duuwth0	0.000000	*	Rush Limbaugh called for that? Jesus thats worse than I thought! I thought he was just calling for the murder of those who had been arrested for drugs. 
t1_duj1t7q	0.273200	*	Yes it is. The entire bill of rights is incorporated (first 10 amendments.)
t1_dupl4rj	0.136100	*	Assuming light inf left protecting an old field seems like a dangerous assumptions. Though i could be giving a pmc commander to much credit

t1_dua9nfx	0.000000	*	to be honest, your comment is lacking real data. no sources, a vague percentage that seems out of nowhere, a possibly true source. Its hard to counter a lack of source statement with another.
t1_dv366ss	0.077200	*	Considering their removal of fatpeoplehate for reasons that are now being violated on a daily basis on extremists subs....... the latter is true.
t1_dumiuph	0.000000	*	That is not how evolution works.
t1_duo8dlt	0.585900	*	It's sad that the criteria for being an actual member of the opposition means being dead. Can anybody living actually oppose Putin, or is Putin so powerful that to oppose him means to die? 
t1_dulm9ut	0.458800	*	I would assume that since they are saying 22 units or more a week puts you at risk, even one beer a day for 7 days would put you at risk. 7 in one day would just be even more of a risk.
t1_dugx96i	-0.177900	*	Care to present your reasoning?

t1_duq43w8	-0.656000	*	If you don't see the shitposting from both sides then you've got a strong bias to one side or the other. 
t1_dujqrmg	-0.542300	*	I'm just impressed that your ass was able to articulate a sentence that long.
t1_dujyokr	-0.709600	*	No you have, yes you can get. Also don't let the cheese be eaten from your bread. Either foredeal has its naydeal.

t1_duzwzna	-0.542300	*	Technically, no, racism requires a power imbalance. Same with sexism. Which is why discrimination against white people in America doesn't fall under a sociological definition of racism.
t1_duzyrcb	0.000000	*	Uh what? Cuba is a million times better than it was under Batista.
t1_duwgn7o	0.737800	*	You even use my insults against you, you fucking amateur. Ok kid. 
t1_dudo669	0.000000	*	Who said anything about skyscrapers?  Im talking about multi story mason buildings with vertical walls.  A skyscraper is technically any building over 7 stories anyways.

t1_dui8dw2	0.000000	*	What are you talking about its been broken for decades
t1_dudimr2	0.648600	*	I don't know, your constant, combative, dismissive appeal to ridicule is *pretty* convincing.
t1_dv39a7c	-0.273200	*	It's trivial to get a new IP address, especially for the types of troll farms in question here. The idea that it's some sort of walled community is naive.
t1_dujkb61	-0.890800	*	No no no it's just their plan to stop all the school shootings. Can't have school shootings if there are no schools. 
t1_duj3dxr	0.000000	*	As a transgender woman, pls advise how to rape other women with my pussy.
t1_duvlosn	0.000000	*	It can only ever take more time.  A lock has a key, therefore it can be picked. A combination lock has a code, therefore it can be guessed.

t1_dumz5ax	0.534600	*	There is absolutely nothing inherent to satire which protects it from being leveraged in propaganda. 
t1_due35uz	0.361200	*	And who was using WW as one?
t1_duyzwqq	0.102700	*	If urban dictionary says it's happening I guess it must be.   
t1_duzwrdo	0.190100	*	They aren't calling for white people or what have you to be killed, unlike some South Africans. They only imprison people for political reasons

t1_dujq8vy	0.770700	*	Pol*lie*tifact. Yea also weak, toiletifact is better.
t1_duggu5x	-0.391900	*	How about you look at the share of taxes paid by corporations. It was already at the lowest ever. Why did you want it to go even lower?  
t1_dutobjx	0.000000	*	You quite probably did have it, despite not manifesting. If they rubbed on you, you've got the antibodies. If you're worried about it you can check with a doctor and have antibody titres done.  
t1_dutjc7j	-0.273200	*	Except it was a real project and it, along with the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, burned many Americans' faith in  government medicine to ashes.
t1_dv44wr2	-0.765000	*	I'd love to live in a world where cloning, even humans, would be much more accepted which would lead to more research in the domain. Fuck ethics if it means progress.
t1_duy4651	0.354200	*	Id wager theyre being heard by more. Theyre bad for certain, but theyre far from unpopular. 
t1_duw6q6l	-0.539000	*	I didn't vote for either but still voted. It didn't matter but I can at least say I didn't vote for him. The party system needs to be abolished. So people actually have to think about who to vote for.
t1_dv22ukd	0.557400	*	That's what lost me... I was ready to support her too. I figured that 4 years of trump would get us a more pro worker pro union democratic party. I don't think that's going to happen though. 
t1_duoxdv1	0.000000	*	I have no idea what your point is.
t1_dujjqvj	0.000000	*	Among the Bushes would be a great title for a one man show starring Sean Spicer.
t1_duss441	-0.091000	*	In the relative timespan of humanity, that isnt a long time to have nukes. How long do you trust humanity with them? Nuclear war already nearly happened at least once. 
t1_duj3qmo	-0.585900	*	Ah yes, especially the whole accident of swallowing polonium in your tea. Or running through a window to commit suicide. Or committing suicide by stabbing yourself several times in the chest and arms.

t1_dux2lf7	-0.318200	*	The source is T_D, so you know it's legit =P
t1_dua6qr3	-0.377400	*	She did won though. She lost due to the election processes and not the democratic vote. So the polls were somewhat right on that one.
t1_dulnuhq	0.492600	*	> coup that killed... Mossadegh  Well that's flat out false. Mossadegh died in his home 14 years after the coup.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh  
t1_ducq8s1	0.649400	*	You're bad at detecting subtext aren't you?
t1_dunnimd	-0.993900	*	Modern progressive liberalism ignores a lot of people in need in favour of the in-group.
t1_dud3r59	-0.363200	*	Yes, many of them were. And the creators openly admitted that most of them were pro-Trump because those supporters were easier to fool. 
t1_duobokx	0.000000	*	Which in itself is whataboutism. Just because other people do something wrong doesn't make you doing it okay.
t1_dupp59o	-0.980300	*	I talk about violent crime,  you talk about mass shootings & murder rate.  How about we continue to compare apples to apples?

t1_duda1d2	0.569700	*	to be clear: are you suggesting sanctions for Russia as a nation?   how would you feel about sanctions against the entire US for the behavior of 13 citizens?

t1_dun6isu	-0.177900	*	Let's not bring Clintons into this.
t1_dv11xzk	-0.250000	*	No, not Gove. It wasnt someone particularly high profile, or even a politician. Just a radio debate between two commentators/journalists.

t1_dufu2i2	-0.318200	*	The pretty thing about law is that it treat everyone equally. Bibi might be corrupt but it wouln't be fair to prioratize his case when there are cases aginst other government officials.

t1_du9zwpv	-0.933700	*	Ah page 16 not 20.  It says that Belgium, France, and Germany are due to terrorist conflicts. That seems fair to me.  But how the fuck is India, **Ukraine**, and Russia suspect?

t1_dv0hny5	0.000000	*	That argument holds truth but fundamentally you need to be able to depict violence. People only really started grasping what the Nazis did once people got to see what concentration camps look like.
t1_duz41y3	0.000000	*	Read Mearsheimer and Walt's book on the Israel lobby.  The Felcher basically described what those two provided evidence of in their book.

t1_dv38hv0	-0.226300	*	 Id argue that this type of attitude helped divide the country and lead to this mess.   But what do i know. 
t1_duxcpe6	0.000000	*	Well, that's true. You also don't have the right not to have your opinion challenged. If you don't want to listen, that just makes you a bigot.

t1_duwm0pi	-0.705600	*	The most I've ever heard someone paying is 200. I've never bought one before and dont live in a MM state. But 1000 seems a little outrageous and inaccessible.

t1_dv4zawv	0.000000	*	It's funny how often these anonymous sources turn out to be real.  Anonymous sources, btw, means it's anonymous to you, not the author. It's not like they get their info from people on Twitter.

t1_duqmz2h	-0.757400	*	This is why it's important for words like rape to have very clear definitions. When a word gets diluted, it stops having a meaning and you start seeing nonsensical statistics that only muddy waters.

t1_duuv5fx	-0.659700	*	What exactly do they fear? This baffles me time and again. We live in the most propserous and safe times ever in our western democracies. What is there to fear?
t1_duwm3t9	0.000000	*	You cant actually believe that medicine in North America is 10 years ahead of literally all of Europe. The reason medical school costs so much is the extreme price gouging done by the AAMC

t1_dusuedr	0.000000	*	I'm just stating facts I'm not defending anyone. The only reason they have nuclear weapons is to keep us out, otherwise we would be at war with them right now.

t1_dv0x5s1	-0.421500	*	How is the EU having an armed forces 'not far off' arming teachers?    27 member states having a shared military would make more sense than each member state having their own armed forces.  
t1_dv1lbk8	-0.775900	*	Millions of people voted against Trump in key swing states and they do not deserve to have a rocky future just because stupidity won out in one election year.

t1_dv4ea19	-0.761500	*	I got fibre in my building too and it's great, in the 100s during the day, but at 9 o'clock everyday like clockwork it drops to 3 Mbps. Wtf?

t1_duqgt1v	0.000000	*	I DECLARE.... BANKRUPTCY
t1_dupgse6	-0.341200	*	But like you realize that's a ridiculous thing to hope for right? The only time a country doesn't need a military is when another entity guarantees it's safety (through military spending).
t1_dugkm3i	0.165500	*	Normally I'd agree with you, but look at who did win... A sex pest reality TV star with the charisma of herpes. 
t1_dv0sk64	0.880700	*	As an American this comment is petty and childish to me 
t1_dup9oc6	-0.658600	*	How does it follow that if you assault one political ideology you should assault them all? 
t1_dul461f	0.374800	*	Pretty sure they are usually left leaning people. I dont ask about party affiliation. Its usually self evident.
t1_duzgvbp	-0.796200	*	The Netherlands would be my first attempt.  Their people rejected the Russian puppet. They saw through all this shit.  Their intel agencies have been all over this story, too.
t1_dusj385	-0.956500	*	You think a subreddit no one has ever heard of outside of a very small circle of users is the same as the entire force of the NRA?  lol, like I said, when you can show me that Ill believe you.

t1_dv2ii2d	0.000000	*	Source? 
t1_duq8mav	0.102700	*	Yeah, surely he was going to purchase it without there being any barcode on the item. Maybe he had never been through a check out line in any store ever.

t1_dueeqa6	-0.683900	*	I meant, how do you write the macro. How do we describe what we're looking for? We would be searching very large areas I think. More than an analysis could effectively search manually.
t1_dv3am8l	0.401900	*	Ohhhhh I always wondered what they meant by pedes.... but now that I know, why did they refer to themselves that way?
t1_durzmno	-0.325200	*	Yeah lol and the 21 thing was state by state too. They were basically pressured into falling in line by the Fed. 
t1_dum92jb	-0.542300	*	Iran is in Syria at the invitation of the government, to hit Iranians, you have to invade Syrian Airspace.
t1_dugqil9	0.812200	*	Are you saying you want 2 cities to be able to pick the president of all the states?
t1_duxreo4	-0.641200	*	The idea of forcing people to wear bowler hats would be hilarious if people weren't being killed over it.  
t1_dup72n4	-0.895700	*	I feel you you're just reaching for something go argue about to be honest.   You really mad cause someone may be polite to you despite being a secret asshole? Really? Lol

t1_dv3fisv	0.177400	*	The problem is that it was painfully obvious to anyone with a half functioning brain that Donald was run amok with bots.  Reddit has the ability to shut down bots, but chose to let them proliferate.

t1_dupkngh	-0.391900	*	Most people get the basic economics part completely wrong. If you believe that bond sales or taxation are revenue for a monetarily sovereign State, like the US, then you are wrong.
t1_dv26s86	0.564700	*	Is it though? We know it's supposed to be, but in practice, is it really?
t1_dupa7uc	-0.599400	*	>no foreign country should there  Russia can be there if it wants to, as it's been invited by the legitimate Syrian government.
t1_duzw5rw	0.318200	*	Nor is it in this case, as I'm pretty sure I made clear. 
t1_duvubpe	0.000000	*	No, i interpreted it as reducing it by 10% is a good thing

t1_duepicw	-0.025800	*	Do you fact check or do you Snopes and politifact? There's a difference. 
t1_duo1ore	0.559400	*	Certainly not ideal, but better than foreign agents being allowed to beat US citizens without serious repercussions.

t1_dv0121w	0.361200	*	Interesting. Despite witnessing that salt and oil do not, in fact, bless them with a more bountiful harvest, they continue to do so? Sounds like insanity.
t1_dv32rzg	0.880700	*	Saddam would be gassing Kurds and Kuwaitis, that's how the world would be. But he's not, because we wasted his ass.
t1_dv2wb5w	-0.423300	*	Yeah, that's what I said.  You haven't put completely baseless words in my mouth at all.
t1_duhsztq	-0.659700	*	There are a great many things about which I sincerely hope that I am wrong.  Being right is pretty much my worst case scenario.
t1_dusdt0i	0.000000	*	I do not trust our electorate anymore at all.  Greed, stupidity, sexism and racism are apparently our national values.  Expect the worst.
t1_duuwksw	-0.629400	*	Ageism is not a valid criticism, you can attack his misogyny, but using his age as a point of criticism is no better than attacking him for his height or skin color. 
t1_dv04k0c	0.000000	*	> Anyone who actually believes the nonsensical power + prejudice narrative is an absolute moron.  Literally flaming ignorance and then calling others morons because of it. Not being a dick at all? :)

t1_dusaqym	-0.542300	*	Many cad packages are/were completely unaffordable because they targeted offices buying in bulk. Right or wrong, piracy is going to result when you sell software for thousands of dollars.
t1_due8111	-0.198900	*	I'd be interested in sources on mocking veterans, if anyone has them.   Not to doubt you, just want for future discussions.

t1_dv0qw21	0.000000	*	Why would pictures of guillotines be against the law? Why would graphic pictures of executions be necessary for the teaching of the French Revolution?
t1_dusun15	0.177900	*	Banning Winnie the pooh? What possible reason would he have for doing that, it's about the most inoffensive thing you could imagine 
t1_duqce1p	0.000000	*	Why did you have to reddit-quote the name lol? He was bad. Had harems of young girls that selected for special service from thier schools. Pretty rough. 
t1_dud6yll	-0.458800	*	Especially if 
t1_duxambr	-0.497000	*	The way you solve it is you pay Nurses more, that incentivizes people becoming nurses and viola, problem fixes itself. Or you could ration healthcare (which is probably happening).
t1_dukw8s6	0.000000	*	> This makes me, LITERALLY, violently sick to my stomach and has left me shaking inside of a 72xb0F home.  You should stop saying things like this.
t1_dv2avfw	-0.307100	*	So essentially Trump is starting a trade war which hurts all Americans except steel workers?
t1_duxeigo	-0.891000	*	In the UK and Australia where it worked they had a low murder rate to begin with, and there was no visible impact after the passage of the ban.

t1_dv33v2u	0.000000	*	They went full T_D, Jew hate, and misogynist out of nowhere in 2016. Made me sad because I love conspiracy theories but it just became the unofficial infowars sub

t1_dudtfur	0.128000	*	For reference, it's illegal everywhere in the world except in the US and New Zealand.

t1_dv38sqx	0.000000	*	Then they should go run their own fucking website.   Guess what though? It's just going to turn into a den of literal nazis and other garbage humans.   Go check out voat to see for yourself. 
t1_dv126qp	0.000000	*	Fellow American, I too find Russia to be fair country. For price of hanging duck in window 2 years in detention. 
t1_duynf6g	-0.421500	*	I think 2014 (and what the Cheeto Mussolini is referring to) is the formation and arrival of the Russian trolls who came to America and organized rallies and purchased social media ads. 
t1_dv3vn2k	0.000000	*	Humans are the exception. What we have become and created puts our destructive powers well beyond natural limits.

t1_dv2l30w	-0.599400	*	Clinton really wasn't a good choice either.  Better than Trump for sure, but that election forced us to decide between two candidates who were pretty big steps down from Obama.
t1_dut2qq0	0.273200	*	The US doesn't deny the causes
t1_dv1r1jj	0.102700	*	Other than the ones with smaller magazines that are harder to change than the military-derived ones. The key feature is high, sustained rate of fire.

t1_dus8n8o	0.273200	*	Ooh, dissent. Let's crush it and pride ourselves in our open minded discourse. Can you justify him getting 40 downvotes? I can't. 
t1_dugahjk	0.000000	*	You are right about the US. The US government is hypocritical too. Especially when it comes to brown Mexicans, who are more native to the Americas than any white person. 
t1_dubn73q	0.458800	*	People will call slightly less left people nazi sympathisers. Don't underestimate how batshit the alt-left is. 
t1_duxm3zg	0.000000	*	I'm pretty sure sheogorath would have a harder time making a more insane kingdom.

t1_dunpu6z	-0.077200	*	Probably not economically feasible either. Half a billion guns in the US - buying a percentage of those back would be a significant cost.

t1_duppzqf	-0.908300	*	I don't disagree that it's s bad idea. Communism has its flaws indeed. But tyrannical dictatorships are awful whether they're capitalist or communist. 
t1_duq8ske	0.250000	*	That is true and I applaud them on that one. That was quite dangerous. They do good work I just don't agree with their view of the 2nd amendment. 
t1_dusifnv	-0.626100	*	You can stand more than you think. Empathy and understanding is how we get out of crazy trump bullshit, not drawing a line in the fucking sand.

t1_dulrkz2	0.000000	*	You've got a great mindset to be a serf.  There are things more important than GDP.
t1_dv4qr9u	0.787200	*	How so? Having emails on a private server doesn't really make someone a monster, no matter how many times it gets repeated.
t1_dulov5i	-0.296000	*	Yea but she still lost the election lol

t1_dum3fky	-0.802000	*	OK so you're alluding to processes which are obviously not guaranteed in the Phillipines and passing judgment on an entire country 
t1_dubsys1	-0.709600	*	Ok, thanks for the personal finance lecture Orange County, but there's a difference between a 17% risk and a 100% robbery. This guy got robbed.

t1_duerdwb	-0.338400	*	You're arguing over something completely unrelated to my point. It's silly to say that doctors pursue their own interests by helping you if they don't want you to die. 
t1_dugn4i3	0.000000	*	Speculation with a China bias. Nothing to see there.
t1_durs978	0.093600	*	I know I'm going to regret this but how say you are pro choice while restricting access to services which is obviously what happens when you can't afford healthcare or abortion care.
t1_duvtgkz	0.669700	*	Thing to remember is China has had the #1 spot for like less than a decade.  The US held the #1 spot for nearly 100 years before that.  So, pot, kettle, black, etc.
t1_dutnn95	0.361200	*	There have been massive changes in nearly every country on earth over the last 100 years. There's no reason to think that N Korea is forever stuck in amber.

t1_dupp0wx	0.200600	*	The right? You're not even going to try and disguise it by saying alt-right or some such term?  Just a blanket condemnation of conservative political ideas altogether?

t1_duqt466	0.000000	*	Okay that makes more sense.  Still quite silly to not know how PDF conversion works though. A software practically dies it for you

t1_dudzb7c	0.000000	*	Its a bit like religion and determinism. If you do X, Y, Z to get into heaven. God gave you free will, so you have a choice whether to not do X, Y and Z and burn in hell.

t1_duskof7	-0.770800	*	There are many good arguments against a wall but your food will cost more because there is no longer slave labor to harvest it is a very bad one

t1_dudu6fp	0.000000	*	Sure, living like apes.  But the level of civilization required to create solar panels is far beyond primitive technology.  We either use this gift to wean from the tit, or perish.

t1_dua9ju6	0.726900	*	I was skeptical he would be re-elected initially, but as his presidency progresses I am finding it increasingly more likely. A lot of Republicans are very happy with what he is doing.
t1_duqu6zu	-0.718400	*	Nonsense. Socialism is about abolishing private property. Nobody in the EU is doing that 
t1_dugs5im	0.964900	*	Because most of the urban votes are concentrated in a few places in the US.  How would you feel as a rural person if all presidents were chosen by NY, LA/SF, and Dallas/Houston?

t1_duzwzna	-0.962800	*	Technically, no, racism requires a power imbalance. Same with sexism. Which is why discrimination against white people in America doesn't fall under a sociological definition of racism.
t1_dur8vpj	-0.296000	*	But in this case, he was seen shooting people, he admitted to doing it for no real reason, he shot kids, so now we pay to house him in prison till he dies. Death by a thousand cuts if you ask me.

t1_dv1f73o	-0.318200	*	To be fair, your comment seemed more like it was meant to antagonize than open discussion.

t1_duuna8f	0.226300	*	What a disingenuous comparison. In the UK, to stay in power the citizens have to vote you in. Did the Chinese vote Xi in for another term?

t1_dv2kjnb	-0.340000	*	This is a bit misleading. Those same polls showed that most people didn't know much about Bernie. The Republicans would have screamed socialism and he would have lost at least some of that advantage.

t1_duq0i9j	0.668200	*	Not true at all.  It's a positive feedback loop. Yes, you're increasing the literal amount of debt, but you're also earning more every time which means the % of debt is lower and lower.
t1_duoy25y	0.000000	*	My dad had a friend that ran his mouth in a Russian bar. They took him outside and cut out one of his eyes to teach him a lesson.

t1_ducbja4	0.273200	*	Well... the US breaks international laws in OTHER countries. So I think this infraction by China is relatively slight. As another person on this thread said, can't have your cake and eat it too.

t1_duntgpf	0.401900	*	So just embrace realpolitik then, instead of disguising it as some kinda freedom-loving moral idealism. At least that would be honest.  America doesn't have friends or allies. America has interests.

t1_dum969h	0.077200	*	The largest air force in the world is the U.S. Air Force. The second largest is the U.S. Navy.  Under what metrics, I'm not sure, but I've heard that cited before.

t1_dugq8bu	0.000000	*	It's both. If you read the federalist papers they talk about guarding against faction, so the theoretical foundation is there. But what faction were the founders concerned about? The unwashed poor.
t1_dupgeb4	0.420100	*	Did you get this info while serving in the military?

t1_dv4xfeq	0.502300	*	Nah. They should be happy if it was. The prostate is really sensitive, thus being called the male g-spot.   Maybe it's a powder and wasn't cut right so it burns?

t1_dusz840	0.906200	*	Am I the only one here thinking that democracy put a completely deranged, potentially traitorous, reality tv host as president, and maybe thats not a great basis for judging others?
t1_dugs5im	0.000000	*	Because most of the urban votes are concentrated in a few places in the US.  How would you feel as a rural person if all presidents were chosen by NY, LA/SF, and Dallas/Houston?

t1_durfq94	-0.784500	*	when has japan ever forgotten the rape of nanking?

t1_duzwzna	0.000000	*	Technically, no, racism requires a power imbalance. Same with sexism. Which is why discrimination against white people in America doesn't fall under a sociological definition of racism.

t1_dumdvv2	0.000000	*	Geographical size especially in terms of barren steppe and tundra isn't important. Russia has 144 million people, it is not the largest country.

t1_dv0o7o0	0.655300	*	Why? Taking land from people who know how to produce from it and handing it to people who have no idea how to work a plough leads to mass starvation. Who'da thunk it.
t1_dv0qrya	-0.700900	*	No im saying that the legacy of colonialism, imperialism, racism, and oppression still makes people's lives hell.

t1_duca1mn	-0.765000	*	Millions of starving Indians object to Churchills idea of help.
t1_dusutwp	0.458800	*	You didn't. It's just only applicable here with certain perspective, and invalid with other. Religion  and its societal implications  is too complex to dumb down with the above statements.
t1_dunphbn	-0.948900	*	This is the root of much of the hate perpetuated by the left, if someone has more money than you, they are evil.

t1_duzz1sn	-0.959800	*	I get that it's a joke but is it really being racist to dislike the people the were racist to you?  
t1_dua6cws	-0.902900	*	Self defense isn't really a valid reason to own a gun, unless you live in the middle of nowhere away from cops. Like a farmer etc. Hunting and sport shooting though, yeah.
t1_duzflce	-0.771700	*	I don't believe that.  Even the hardest Republicans are pissed at trump on that point.  I just don't think they care truly that much because they know the Russians are helping them too.

t1_duyosze	0.273200	*	Neither are the immigrants coming across the South Canadian border from the United States. They're not fleeing anything other than Trump. And he's not hunting them down to butcher them all.
t1_dv0lsk8	0.177900	*	If the majority of the western world has free speech and hate speech laws, why shouldn't the Americans call it something else? We outnumber you.

t1_duu3juw	0.000000	*	Um CNN and NBC are not left. They are straight-news, with a decidedly pro-capitalist pro-business right-wing slant if anything. Not being out-and-proud fascist does not mean you are left.
t1_dubpoi2	0.457600	*	There are no significant oil and gas fields in Syria. Im a geologist who has worked professionally on that area in this regard.  They have very minor amounts of hydrocarbons.

t1_duja87m	0.000000	*	I meant the premise of our invasion was that they supposedly did have them.  It's late. My comment didn't make sense. I should go to bed.

t1_dui89g4	0.204000	*	My family had a $130k household income in 2017. We ended up paying 5.4% in federal taxes. We didn't use any fancy tax strategy either, just the standard deduction

t1_dv2z8h1	0.622900	*	I haven't heard anyone advocate for bringing back the cold war. However, we have evidence that a foreign power meddled in our election(s). I can't believe anyone wouldn't want that to be investigated.

t1_dutn6j0	-0.757900	*	Vaccines in particular?  Nothing.  Healthcare in general?  Everything 
t1_dupx4pt	0.000000	*	Its easier and makes more sense to focus on the largest most populous Occidental nation than to talk about the 40 smaller ones. Wed be here forever.

t1_dugqby6	-0.226300	*	Also they put it in place specifically to prevent someone like Trump from being elected.  The electoral college had one job and it fucked that up.
t1_duvu4fm	0.329100	*	The old testament is pretty fucked up too. If we still followed that to the letter, things would get weird
t1_duj8752	0.909900	*	Exactly. 50 years ago, gays were treated horribly in the US and other countries as well. 30 years from now, Russia might be much less homophobic.

t1_dukxx92	0.000000	*	Oh please. The dirty secret is that Duterte himself is the kingpin. Follow the money. His offshore houses and bank accounts speak volumes. When questioned about it, he says a rich man left it to him.

t1_duehrz1	-0.067900	*	interesting article but it does not lay blame for the housing bubble on progressive housing policy. Perhaps you misread my post or the one I was responding to
t1_dusxehc	-0.025800	*	At least he get the job done. I don't really care if he does all the detailed fucked up things. His contribution for the country weighs more than what you have pointed out.

t1_dutl7um	-0.476700	*	I am well aware of America's own crimes in this regard, we had it coming. But my post wasn't about that. MY post was about Russians doing it to us. It is not an opportunity for incessant whataboutism.

t1_duvayfo	0.165500	*	> miles and feet are used to measure different things  They both measure length.  Name one thing that is measured in miles, that couldn't also be measured in feet.  I challenge you.

t1_duf4gy9	0.401900	*	So if there's no right-wing counterpart, how do you know that CBC is only moderately left-wing and not far left wing?   Also, who keeps the left wing parties honest? 
t1_duhun0m	0.000000	*	That's not what unanimous means. The result in Scotland was 62-38 in favour of remain. There were over a million Scottish voters who wanted to leave. 
t1_duv9uzb	-0.318200	*	We need a watermark or some sort of indication for posters who use T_D or appear to be Russian. Can anyone design a bot that would call out T_D posters?

t1_dv2dwg6	0.709600	*	Hillary was very much against Citizen United, in fact the whole Citizens United decision was a decision against Hillary Clinton in the first place.

t1_dv0gf8r	-0.836000	*	But probably more dangerous then just not giving them a gun
t1_dupgn9g	0.401900	*	no one is anti german but they both kinda lost the privilege of having large standing armies, thats why there is still active US bases in both countries.
t1_dui1ofe	-0.886000	*	Is that really official policy? It certainly does happen. But official policy? I'd like to see some proof about that.
t1_duhuo6j	0.000000	*	Yeah. Every account on r/worldnews is a robot bought by the PAP to scam gullible voters in Singapore. There's no such thing as any actual PAP supporter online. /s

t1_dui9bsd	0.051600	*	Capital gains tax rate was about 40% at that time, it's like 15% now.  That would go hand in hand with raising the income tax brackets.

t1_dutlmcs	-0.318200	*	IT'S ALL PART OF GOD'S PLAN. 
t1_dupkbyd	0.866000	*	Funny how the left never acknowledges this. They expect the US to just hand out citizenship like candy 
t1_dudguo7	0.000000	*	Maybe, but that leaves two outcomes. Either they're criminal or idiots. Neither seems like a great trait I'd want with people running the country.

t1_dv0038g	0.700300	*	It's kind of funny and sad that the local newspaper here (very small suburban town) generally has more legit news than any other newspaper you can get here (very large city).
t1_dv4nh7l	0.440400	*	> How do make it more long distance?  Put the bike on a train.
t1_dur8ruu	0.636900	*	I changed nothing. The Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia was socialist.  The CIA and Thatchers UK did not back them. You are beyond stupid.
t1_dumitu6	-0.542300	*	Rape victims can recover, dead is dead. Implying being dead is better than being a rape victim is part of the problem.

t1_duj73zq	0.000000	*	Alright Katya.
t1_duibgkp	0.884300	*	No. It wouldn't hurt everyone, because if you keep the total tax amount the same, taxing assets allows you to tax the rich much more than the poor, thus you could lower taxes on the poor. 
t1_duxnsl1	0.000000	*	Jews don't recognize Jesus  Protestants don't recognize the Pope  Baptists don't recognize each other at the liquor store

t1_duuyqeu	0.296000	*	I cannot conceive of Duarte as having repressed shame. This is a guy who bragged about killing people as a kid. He's a sociopath. 
t1_duq66o3	-0.341500	*	So...chaos?
t1_dumo2cy	0.000000	*	That's my point.  I'm not sure I see a net benefit in concentrating all the trash in a landfill versus letting it fall where it may, from an environmental perspective.
t1_duwkosn	-0.318200	*	So OPs post basically
t1_dujjogb	0.000000	*	How about within the US though? You expect the proportion of the people in the prison system to be representative of the same % of ethnicities which make up the US? Or is your logic piss poor?

t1_duzk2yv	0.708800	*	Betsy Devos is the education secretary.  Her dad started amway which is one of the biggest pyramid schemes in history.  Bernie Madoff ran a ponzi scheme which is a different thing.

t1_dugq595	0.612400	*	I can tell you right now the majority of that 70% didn't support him. A huge portion of Bernie supporters were very against Hillary and Trump and didn't vote at all or voted 3rd party.
t1_duxikd6	0.338400	*	Russia is a hellhole, Putin is nothing but a dictator that wants to drag others to his level, so his own power is easier to defend.

t1_dunzop5	-0.402300	*	You have the right to obtain a free and open internet. You don't have the right to make someone give you internet access.   I don't think you understand what I meant by 'free and open.'

t1_duhutvp	0.000000	*	Why don't the Scots fight for independence? 
t1_dv2jgtr	0.296000	*	almost every poll showed trump losing to clinton, that's why it was such a surprise.  Bernie polled even better but don't think that Clinton was ever suppose to lose coming out of the primaries.
t1_dv0121w	-0.296000	*	Interesting. Despite witnessing that salt and oil do not, in fact, bless them with a more bountiful harvest, they continue to do so? Sounds like insanity.

t1_dusirx9	-0.273200	*	The Thalmor won't stay on good terms with them for long. They want to erase Talos from godhood and then toss out humanity, a species protected by the Shezzarine.
t1_duouun0	0.000000	*	Well, our society is definitely not ready for illegal cociane, so I'd say we try something new.

t1_dujl6st	-0.743000	*	I love the idea of Trump debating some random person, and he cant say anything, because he literally has no idea who this person is.
t1_duoaux4	-0.409100	*	the worst part is that japanese men are raised to think this is the norm, and they wonder why Japanese women are drawn towards American men (and even Korean and Chinese men).
t1_duih4h7	0.597800	*	I literally went to open secret and looked up the amount of money they donated. My bad for making you clarify your point and expand your parameters. I shouldn't have even given you the time of day.

t1_duzysik	0.000000	*	I get his point though. Before long non-white Hispanics will be the majority in the US. I wonder how that will affect US politics.

t1_dv3ht2p	-0.844200	*	>declaration that Obama was not a legitimate president    >That's evil.    You have to love the irony here. Do you really think this is evil or are you just posturing? Honest question.
t1_duuv5fx	-0.897700	*	What exactly do they fear? This baffles me time and again. We live in the most propserous and safe times ever in our western democracies. What is there to fear?
t1_duxzdpl	0.000000	*	I'm not saying they are for or against it. Only that they haven't said a single word about it.  Not even a retweet or a like.  Seems like a very significant feminist issue.

t1_dugraws	0.807400	*	But La or NY doesn't represent me several states away. Why should they be able to decide the president, but not me?
t1_duvf9l6	-0.943200	*	They just have to counter every liberal stance.
t1_duqbqnq	0.520000	*	She bailed out wall street CEOs at taxpayer expense, and then did the same for the automotive industry. She's one of the worst crony capitalists that's ever lived.

t1_duhicj7	0.000000	*	Well that would be similar to lumping in people of other countries with their leaders opinions/beliefs... People who do that aren't exactly brimming with common sense.

t1_dusxkxa	-0.102700	*	I agree with you, but that's not how the court ruled.  The goal should be to idiot-proof them, so this cannot happen. You do want everyone's intentions to be properly represented on their ballots.

t1_duzx6vz	-0.694600	*	In fairness the embargo would ban them from having any dealings with the US if they invested in Cuba. 
t1_ducgags	0.000000	*	What a broad statement. You can pretty much say that about any country.   The point is the US fd them over multiple times by destabilizing their government when they had stability. 
t1_duo7cn4	-0.889100	*	It's common knowledge that large part of Islamic extremists in Syria are former Iraqi military.
t1_dugbily	0.642800	*	European countries have extremely strict immigration policies and deportation is fast and efficient.   They set a standard, and it's how strict we should be.

t1_dupoue4	0.636900	*	The terms are definitely not interchangeable. Democratic socialism operates with a socialist economy while a social democracy is a mixed economy with a focus on welfare.

t1_dv26gxj	0.907400	*	So? The fact that it was illegal is a huge deal. You could argue anything is foreign interference but it matters whether laws were broken since that suggests a line was crossed.
t1_duf8rgq	-0.599400	*	It wasn't long ago that private armies were better funded and  more powerful than national ones.  Don't forget your history.
t1_duhx64r	0.000000	*	Hood rat things with their friends

t1_durg3u8	-0.624900	*	We knew in Chile while it was happening, it was never a big secret. You are pushing unfounded conspiracy theories to further an agenda. The US government has always been terrible at keeping secrets. 
t1_dujkzla	-0.457500	*	That's not what he said. Just because you don't like a statistic, does not mean it isn't true.

t1_duj468k	-0.481100	*	I know there are reasons (though, let's be honest, excuses is more accurate) for it. That doesn't change the fact that Russia's treatment of LGBT persons is barbaric compared to the United States'.

t1_duqltio	-0.969700	*	this is a conspiracy theory dude 
t1_duzwzna	0.703400	*	Technically, no, racism requires a power imbalance. Same with sexism. Which is why discrimination against white people in America doesn't fall under a sociological definition of racism.

t1_dunkf4r	0.905800	*	The fact that people think CNN MSNBC or Fox news are free press blows my mind. They all have an agenda they are pushing, none of them tell the truth.

t1_duzwzna	0.000000	*	Technically, no, racism requires a power imbalance. Same with sexism. Which is why discrimination against white people in America doesn't fall under a sociological definition of racism.

t1_duibgkp	-0.526700	*	No. It wouldn't hurt everyone, because if you keep the total tax amount the same, taxing assets allows you to tax the rich much more than the poor, thus you could lower taxes on the poor.

t1_dv0anpu	0.000000	*	Hehehehe
t1_duxgqxo	0.588500	*	Liberals are centrist, not left wing.  It is confusing because Trudeau is really socially left wing, but is still backing his party's right wing economics.  Like oil pipelines, enacting the TPP, etc.

t1_dul2yr5	-0.296000	*	You just described every inner city in the US. The difference? Americans in the inner city don't want the government murdering their criminals, because it's fucked up to do.

t1_dui662i	-0.765000	*	So 99% of the country has to struggle because when you hypothetically become rich your hypothetical children can afford an extra large mansion instead of a regular mansion?

t1_duq52oc	0.980000	*	I mean you made the comment, I was seriously asking.   As for your comment, do you believe there is wisdom in saying that people tend to side with the ones they agree with most?

t1_dv1tvw7	0.975300	*	That stuff is bad for you though.  We wear gloves when we do quality inspection after plate. Boss read an article online about small amounts over a period of time being harmful and such.

t1_dufooub	0.493900	*	I guess it's mostly because on paper we don't *need* the extra expense of a direct line of sight mountain detector.  Until it suddenly turns out that you really did.  :(
t1_duyuvk6	-0.229600	*	Oh yeah, that... Yeah I don't like that about him. But I don't like Trudeau's stance on it either, way too far left.

t1_duaih7e	0.000000	*	not much honestly. just an employer wanting to hire you.
t1_duyxc2s	0.932000	*	No, they've all come together under the GOP banner.  Stop limiting this to just the trump admin, it was the toxic GOP/rightwing that merely enabled trump.
t1_durhuv1	0.000000	*	If you have talked with American citizens who have denied using nuclear weapons against civilians, I apologize. They apparently do not know their history, and it's disappointing
t1_duxjcr6	-0.928600	*	Im sorry youre so angry over stuff that you really shouldnt be angry about. Peoples religion is their business. And youre just a bully as far as I can tell.

t1_dugdty1	0.510600	*	> won't have you running around naked punching people.  We've obviously been doing different acid.
t1_duwllcy	0.000000	*	Because the US system isn't a free market. It's regulated heavily just in favour of private industry. 
t1_duwqec0	-0.875000	*	That's just blatant authoritarianism. A mere accusation should never be enough to take someone's children.
t1_dv0g6y5	-0.710600	*	It's not perfect, but yes I do prefer proxy wars to a large scale war between two nuclear superpowers. 
t1_duj2s3r	-0.645100	*	When it comes to their homophobia, there isn't much difference between extremist followers of Islam and extremist followers of Christianity. 
t1_dv4jdfs	-0.851900	*	Which should have been regulated away a loooooong time ago, because no where else in America does ANYONE use megabits or gigabits.  It is literally only used by shitbag ISPs.

t1_duszrf3	0.526700	*	That's good, but they should update the original article. Like the way Al Jazeera updated their article about the floods in Gaza. I didn't see the new article posted on r/Israel, only the first one. 
t1_durglew	0.440400	*	It comes in yards?
t1_duz3k0s	0.000000	*	Not when these two women manage to just vanish without a trace. Untraceable kidnapping and never hear from them again. Russian govt is scary as shit.

t1_dufuwjl	0.102700	*	Talking out the ass is a leading cause of death on reddit.
t1_duso6by	-0.809300	*	How would the government get money from that? Do you think they have a tax on kidnappings or something? 
t1_dupjjmv	0.466000	*	And clearly you've never heard of General Vlasov.  Or National Bolshevism, Alexander Dugin, the Russian fascist party, etc. 
t1_duqap4h	0.636900	*	Well you sure jumped to a completely different topic pretty quick.  You know legally that the NRA and the 2A aren't the same entity, right?
t1_dv1cdpf	-0.325200	*	Bushknives unite! ;)  here have some buai.
t1_duwdefw	0.401900	*	You do realize that kids are a massive money sink right? If you saved the money instead of having kids you'd be fully prepared for your well-being later in life

t1_dv0poao	0.000000	*	> That seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction.  How is it arbitrary? You can't show a picture of your penis in public but you can in a museum designated for penis pictures.

t1_duvx1hn	-0.526700	*	At least that's organic and will decompose.
t1_dur6wvb	0.000000	*	So they used atomic because it did more damage and the Japanese were already trained to evacuate at the sign of those planes or that's the public reasoning for payback on pearl harbor
t1_dush7rt	-0.119500	*	What you don't have ears? No one in the hotel was allowed to have a gun. Like 70 people died because guns were banned.
t1_dubmw7x	-0.400500	*	Not arguing, but I'm curious what actions Hillary could have taken to prevent or mitigatete this.  What are your thoughts?

t1_dua5nzs	0.585900	*	What was Wenger thinking sending Walcott on that early?

t1_duq8mav	-0.796400	*	Yeah, surely he was going to purchase it without there being any barcode on the item. Maybe he had never been through a check out line in any store ever.
t1_durq891	0.812600	*	The common argument is, Legalize cannabis, think of how much money you can make from the people who use it!  That argument is morally wrong from the outset.
t1_dv1hitg	0.457200	*	It will certainly stop his/her (the OP)'s raping. 
t1_dv14yaa	0.271600	*	Its French law. You cannot share terroristic actions willy nilly. It makes far more sense to ban or censor voilent actions than sexual content, which is what we do in the US.
t1_dua6qr3	-0.340000	*	She did won though. She lost due to the election processes and not the democratic vote. So the polls were somewhat right on that one.
t1_dunbw0w	0.000000	*	Why are you concerned more by the image of your country in the world and on the internet more, than by that there are actually people being murdered by your politicians ?
t1_dur0vs5	0.273200	*	What's wrong with liquorice?
t1_duyiu5a	-0.510600	*	If Bernie Sanders couldn't take on the DNC then he couldn't have taken on the Russian intelligence services. 
t1_dubet49	-0.828400	*	I'm sure there is. I'm just saying that it's not a crazy or weird way to kill animals. I know a few small-scale farmers, and they generally kill animals with a knife to the neck. 
t1_duv388c	0.000000	*	I'm talking about the Philippines, guy. But in any case, Trump does seem to have a special fondness for dictators and their tactics, so don't be surprised if he tries to do something similar

t1_duykd1j	0.000000	*	Saying that some piece of evidence is the smoking gun is far different than saying Trump is for sure finished this time.  And it's pretty true there has been quite a few smoking guns already.

t1_dujmg8x	0.735100	*	Are you a Russian troll or are you wanting some violent revolution? Going against the constitution is unAmerican.

t1_duyjbx1	0.284600	*	You may find upon further research that the administrative systems of the Qing Dynasty and the People's Republic of China differ considerably.   Succession is an issue of huge importance.

t1_duf8ksq	0.571900	*	those uncesorednews type of reddit are corners too, the people ostracized in r/politics go to those subs, and the people keep circlejerking in r/politics.
t1_dukknii	0.000000	*	It's easy as hell; it's called the /s tag.  Put it at the end of a sentence to indicate sarcasm.
t1_dusi21f	0.897900	*	That's dumb and you know it. If companies do well the country does well. And it's not like that's the only thing he's improved.

t1_dul1ph8	0.000000	*	And frankly, the problem with heroin for users is not being able to get high quality stuff. It is possible to keep using without increasing the dose. H needs to be decriminalized, possibly legalized.
t1_dv3kn7q	-0.714700	*	Could this mean most of the talk about troll bots is then just bunk to dismiss other views?
t1_durd0a6	0.000000	*	The NRA already had the message, there Russians just paid for it (in part). I'm not sure if the NRA was aware of the Russian play or not - anyone know?

t1_duh5fk6	0.128000	*	> Nobody actually thinks President Trump colluded with Russia, not even his biggest haters.   Except plenty of people do, because there is a near-zero chance that he didn't.
t1_dur4063	-0.296000	*	It's possible to do both at the same time.
t1_duxkuqw	-0.886000	*	No. There is no difference. Women don't have a choice either way. You think women that legally work in brothels have a choice?

t1_dulmd6k	0.112400	*	If it comes to needing to shoot a cop then the situation has well passed reason.   Use it to defend yourself from people who would try to steal from you or kill you.
t1_dv47eow	0.900300	*	That is a girls penis
t1_dv0dean	0.636900	*	I amounted to a lot too, and I recognize that I had a lot of help. Some of us are trying to give back, not just get whats mine or whatever.

t1_dupk56q	0.318200	*	true, i was being hyperbolic.   i know it pisses americans off, but military spending is simply a waste of money for half the european countries. which is why many will never meet the nato goal.
t1_dur5t9l	-0.687900	*	Don't bother, they're so privileged they literally cannot imagine having to resort to violence for any reason.  The naivety is mind boggling, shows how narrow some people's life experience is.

t1_duq3tg0	-0.929800	*	Yeah, way to parrot a stat and completely ignore all the negative externalities if alcohol vs tobacco.  You can enjoy throwing it in a pan as you are so fond of, but it is a scourge on society.
t1_dupqv9c	-0.916900	*	Even worse is that the press covers that instead of people who actually know what they're doing. The media on both sides is definitely guilty of this. 
t1_duo4646	0.000000	*	GamerGate was an extreme example.   Speaking of where people belong, you belong in your mother's basement, friendless, and most importantly, without internet access.

t1_duo0wvb	-0.391900	*	The issue is that rubbish such as straws, fast food containers etc often don't even make it to a bin never mind a landfill.  Why have trash at all if you can have re-usable products?
t1_duef20l	0.000000	*	Despite having 80% of its land area and population, as well as its capital, and all rights and responsibilities the USSR had? Yep. Totally different, like Ghana to the British Empire...

t1_duqmggw	0.000000	*	Out of curiosity how is an act of war described. If russia were to somehow tank the stock markets would we consider it one? What electronic attacks vs what institutions qualify?

t1_duykew5	0.782000	*	Me either but Trump is a pompous asshole that constantly belittles people, makes wild accusations, and denies this stuff.  Was he married at the time? 
t1_dunlixz	0.000000	*	Republicans 
t1_duynkbc	0.000000	*	Yup, people here can't seem to accept that Trump is president.   I honestly wonder what goes through the minds of the Russians everywhere, Trump sexual obsession and I know Mueller knows posters.

t1_duoyrgw	0.655800	*	Yeah but was that proven?  Last I heard it wasn't.  I mean, if you're going to kill the guy for drug dealing, at least let's get our facts straight.  Otherwise we're no better than Duterte.
t1_duwrjsk	0.884700	*	But the majority dont. Its disingenuous to compare the median salary for nurses to anecdotal evidence points.   In 2014 the average person who graduated with a bachelors degree made $48k.

t1_duyrowe	-0.798700	*	So far that there is absolutely no evidence, I guess.

t1_duakbra	-0.800800	*	Is it? When somebody says that adults do something, the implication  at least for me  is that kids don't. In that sense, it's usually the adult course of action that's implied to be superior.

t1_duyvuvp	-0.872000	*	Lol, just because you are miserable doesn't mean you should inflict non existence on all possible future human beings, that is the greatest genocide possible. 
t1_duaea2r	-0.177900	*	Do you somehow think that superdelegates were new to this election? Not to mention, Bernie lost the popular vote as well.   And you're quoting an allegation as fact.

t1_duvtgkz	-0.690000	*	Thing to remember is China has had the #1 spot for like less than a decade.  The US held the #1 spot for nearly 100 years before that.  So, pot, kettle, black, etc.

t1_dunqcis	-0.557400	*	Blue whales have the largest brains of any creature in the history of the earth.  But you dont see blue whales on the moon yet.

t1_duxz86b	0.318200	*	Never said they did it for the *sake* of legalizing it. You might do well to actually read what I write before you reply in the future.
