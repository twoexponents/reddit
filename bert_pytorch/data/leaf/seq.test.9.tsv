A promise by the united states years ago that said they would nuke the shit out of Russia if they tried. However that doesn't mean Russia cannot fund other countries/entities to invade, therefore you need tanks

TI found that majority of countries in the world can be called corrupt, with a clear link between high levels of corruption and little protection of the media and civil society groups.. [Corruption Perceptions Index 2017 in detail from official TI site.](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017). What happened in Finland? A four point drop over one year seems excessive.. Italy I get, nothing new there, but I'm slightly surprised to Spain doing so poorly. Are you serious? It's a bit of bureaucratic nightmare there. Id think it's easy to hide bribes/etc. when you're hidden behind a large and complex bureaucratic structure . 65 down to 57 is down to bureaucracy. Surely the Spanish would be entitled to think they're better than Botswana?  Might it be the impact of devolved governments and poor local oversight?. Is there anything particularly corrupt about Botswana?. They're African, obviously.  /s    . Well yes and Africa is not unfairly known as a pretty corrupt place but I remember hearing Botswana was in pretty good shape corruption and governance wise and it is so it's not suprising to me that's it's above European countries like Italy and Spain.   And of course it's above European basketcases like poor Ukraine in corruption and GDP(*I was actually born in Ukraine)

On average, a boy born in one of the most affluent areas will outlive one born in one of the poorest by 8.4 years.. Diet and smoking is the reason. Poverty is the reason.  The things you mention are secondary effects. But if they stopped smoking, they would have more money for better food.  I never understand why its ok for people on benefits to spend all their money on smoking and drinking. . 1) Those things are addictive   2) They make you feel good temporarily, and people subsisting barely on benefits don't have an abundance of happiness in their daily lives. . Training does exactly that, so go train instead of smoking. Nah, it's easier to blame someone else like the tobacco companies for you being poor and making stupid decisions. You don't have to smoke just because you're poor, you don't have to eat at McDonald's. Don't smoke and make your own food and you'll live as long as Bill Gates . This is a game that can be played back and forth so I'll do it. Training needs time and will. When you're working a soul crushing job and commute 1 hour with tube/bus you're not always in the mood for training. Especially when you can't afford to spend money for a gym membership. . Can't afford? You're implying a cigarette addiction  is cheaper than a gym membership. Get a grip. . It's not but it's easier. You're not dealing with rational though, too, so that enters into account.

Portugal person here caralho  It is ~~legal~~ not legal, **only decriminalized** to consume and possess small portions of drugs for personal consume, but if you sell, you go to prison. Then why can I not walk 5 steps in Lisbon without hearing marijuana coke? I just figured everything was sorta kinda legal, definitely didnt seem like the police were enforcing anything. Disclosure: I was only there for a week but this happened at all hours of the day every day we were there.. Because it's not actually marijuana nor coke. It's completely illegal to sell.  Trust me, everybody here hates those guys. Also, you probably look really foreign, they basically target tourists.. As someone visiting right now, I've noticed. I've been asked 3-4 times a day, for a couple of days now. At least *most* of them take no for an answer. It does look like the police doesn't care though. Is not like it's hard to tell who's selling most of the time. And there's quite a few police cars and officers around.. Because they aren't actually selling drugs, they are selling condiments to guilluble tourists. Many a idiot has smoked some mangled parsley. Do the laws regarding trading standards, regulating street vendors, and so on apply to people purporting to sell illegal goods?. As with most of the EU, the penalties for this sort of thing is minor, and the police usually doesnt bother. After all, this is a social problem, and needs to be addressed through social policies. These vendors are victims of their circumstances for minor scams  Tourists be damned U0001f609

It'd be a great way of improving our crumbling roads and canals, and allow for some amazing on-the-job training in construction and engineering fields.. Might not be a bad idea for vets and soon-to-be vets too eh? But of course budget issues probably shoot that idea in the foot.  Edit: forgot a word. Military labor is fairly cheap. Probably cheaper than contractors. It could be a great way to reintegrate vets..

Trade relations should be reestablished, though, especially since Fidel Castro is no longer in power.  . Is there going to be any return of property ot repatriation for American cubanos who Castro's regime robbed?  There has been no change in the embargo because there has been no effort on behalf of the regime to address their crimes.. Look like Cuban doesn't give a shit that rich people lost their properties. . And America doesn't give a shit about the embargo.. Just like how americans dont care about how they treated the native cubans. . And the solution to that was to have a bunch of murdering bandits rob everybody who wasn't already a peasant?  The crimes of the regime will either be addressed, or they won't. The embargo is the price Cubans pay for entertaining their myths of innocence.. Are we talking about the Americans cause that sounds like what the Americans where doing. . Based on what? Cuba was owned by the Spanish until the Spanish-American war, the period afterwards of American occupation had terrible labor practices, but it wasn't murder and robbery the way Maximo Gomez (that worthless rotten murdering piece of shit) and Castro ran their revolutions.

The point is that of course it's true, it's how it's defined. Even and prime are both defined by what they are divisible by, and the only time divisible by 2 is the same as divisible only by 1 and itself is when itself=2.. Yeah, and that's why its neat!.

Primes are really useful as encryption keys. Banks and such have a high demand for them.. Not for much longer though. Quantum computing will destroy Prime-based encryption and mathematicians can work on a problem completely unrelated to the world in peace until someone finds another use for them.. I'm interested in how quantum computing will destroy prime-based encryption. Is it purely the increased computing power? Any resources you can point me at?. Quantum Computers dont actually posses more computing power. What they can do a lot faster than normal computers though is factorization. Ill look to find some resources if you want to know more. Edit: found a resource although you may want to watch their whole series rather than this one specific video of it. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwZZaI5u0c

US military arms sales is its biggest economy by far, do you really think it gives two shits about where or who the weapons go to. Well they do now when those weapons get turned on themselves. . The only solution is to sell even more arms to India. /s. Aah it is a great business model that we as Australians got suckered into as well. . Australia, I assume, is a relatively small weapons market as a consumer.. F-35 lightning 2 we have spent 100s of billions of dollars too. Abrams tank is another we should've got the leopard 2 just too name a couple. . If the Leopard2 is a better tank than the Abrams, you should let the Australian military know.   Anyways, as an American, thanks for being a customer!. We are locked into buying their second hand crap because of the development of the F-35. .

But then blame the us for not acting   Edit: interesting how this went from +10 to -11 . trust me no one gonna blame Donald for staying the fuck out of this.. If we stayed out of it South Korea would not exist.. Yeah we would have recognized the legitimate government that existed in China, but instead we set up our own guys instead. Geopolitics sure is fun. China voted with USA and the other Security council members except Yugoslavia and Russia in favor of the Korean War.. The soviets boycotted the UN at that time didnt it? Thats why the UN was actually able to send forces there. Also yeah of course they supported it, they needed the US to protect them from the commies.. Yes the first part is correct. The second part is speculative.

Yeah Assad soldiers murdering people is better than raping them. Of course.. Assad soldiers were not going around murdering people before Saudi Arabia and the west decided to start a proxy war in Syria to overthrow Assad. The place was pretty peaceful under Assad rule in comparison to what it is now.. Assad could have responded better than having his military police shoot live rounds at protesters.. He didn't. Terrorists were using the protest as cover to kill police.. And the military was already infiltrated as well. The 'shoot first' army in those initial protests defected over to the rebels and took military weapons with them. Then people wonder why others are so skeptical that Assad was the one who was gassing people. . This, of course, is absolute horseshit.

If they did western medias woul have put it all over the headlines considering how anti-Assad they are. Maybe, but The soldiers of a military despot commit rape is sort of a dog-bites-man headline, though. Aid workers raping? That's a little more man-bites-dog..

You can't hide your nationality and culture behind the flag of UN.. This is an important question. Most other comments in this thread seem to just take shots at the U.N. as an organization when it may not deserve the blame.. Isn't the fact that the UN uniquely allows for this kind of exploitation and is also complicit with it make it at least partially responsible?. I wouldn't say they allow it, they have limited control over the people ostensibly put under their 'control' but often report back to their home countries instead and are threatened to be pulled out   The UN should have its own permanent peace keeping force that they get personal control IMO. But seriously what third world nation troops did the UN have to deal with this time? . developed country troops behave badly too  http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-39070492/un-promises-to-stamp-out-abuse-after-child-rape-allegations. Yes and? I'm not going to defend troops when they act in horrific or barbaric ways, from any nation regardless of their development level. I only think of third world nations due to the fact that I have low expectations for the discipline of their troops as well as those troops moral integrity. . Yeah that's fair assessment, I just don't like that assessment though cause it does allow barbaric soldiers from first world countries to get away easier with their acts, they should all be scrutinized equally
t3_7z4bt7	1	*	Germany deports more rejected Afghan asylum seekers. Despite protests, 14 Afghans deemed dangerous or with criminal status were flown back to Kabul from Bavaria, marking the tenth round of deportations in Germany since 2016.. I love how they even protest against  deporting rejected asylum seekers . There are legal considerations, even if you're rejected there's the obligation not to send people to places where they'll probably be killed. Political opinions aside, this is questionable conduct.. > this is questionable conduct  Ok, so what do you propose be done with these illegal criminals? Let them all stay back?. Well, sending them to their death is illegal, so probably using domestic legal structures the same way you would do to anyone else is the way to go. Unfortunately, law and order is not a concern of the PEGIDA types.. So *practically* invite criminals/extremists from conflict zones across the world to enter your country and fill your prisons, live off taxpayer money and also perhaps radicalise fellow prisoners in the process, eh? That sounds like a really good idea to me. Yeah, I mean after growing up in a warzone (everyone under 18 in Afghanistan) then walking ~6000km to get away from the criminals/extremists, possibly being murdered/enslaved by people smugglers or other criminals, and then living in a refugee centre (Germany has opened the old concentration camps for this purpose) is definitely a warm invitation that anyone would take. Sounds really enticing!. Oh my God you're serious . Oh my God you're a joke

There are legal considerations, even if you're rejected there's the obligation not to send people to places where they'll probably be killed. Political opinions aside, this is questionable conduct.. Nothing against asylum seekers, legitimate ones.  But ones that are deemed dangerous or with criminal status? No thanks.. The logic is that if we deport them and they are really likely to die there its almost like a death penalty, which is banned in Germany. So we cant/shouldnt do that. I agree that they should not stay in Germany, but neither is sending them into a likely death an option.. So, then what is the option? Keep them and risk the lives of your citizens, or send them back and risk their lives?   I think one of those is a clear winner. . Keeping them in prison here in Germany.. That only works if they have committed a crime. Also, you can't keep them in prison indefinitely. That's a whole new can of worms. . Funny thing is that is the definition of criminal. So deporting criminals who haven't comitted a crime is still questionable.

This is how it should be everywhere. Plus astronomical fees for refusing vaccinations for longer periods. . I disagree with fines and fees and that sort of thing. It's one thing to keep them out of school, because that's legitimately protecting other kids from them, but fining or forcing people is going to feed conspiracy theories and legitimize the anti-vaccination movement.. I don't really care about feeding conspiracy morons, I just don't want horrible diseases to come back. 100,000$ a year if you don't vaccinate, or quarantine in jail.   It's probably good that I didnt go to law school. Your propositions will have the opposite effect of what you want. When you take such extreme measures to force people to do what you want, you legitimize opposition. It's also not remotely nonsensical to think that the government would drug its own citizens unknowingly when it has done so in the past.

Im not saying this is the perfect solution, but I'd love to treat anti-vaccination people this way, because they're a lethal threat to the sane part of society.

I don't think the people who proposed making autism a broad spectrum could have imagined the harm and resurgence of preventable diseases that would result. Weird result of doing that.. It's not exactly a result of changing the definition to a spectrum. It is, however, a result of stupid people ignoring science and doing whatever they want without regard for consequences..

I've never heard Australian internet described better.. I live in rural Australia, I pay $50 for 10GB a month.  When I download a game I have to incorporate the file size in the price. Just typing this comment was expensive.  EDIT: Clarity.. Wow, fuck your ISP.. That rate means he's using mobile broadband as a home connection. Those things are expensive.  The entire country can get 25Mbps satellite internet. It's not a great ping (about 300ms), but you can get 100s of GB a month. I see a lot of people that will pay the same amount but split the cost across 4G/Satellite so they have both speed-latency/volume downloads.. Yeah I pay about 30 a month for 4.5 GB of 4G LTE for mobile, but my home connection is unlimited and a pretty fair price. I get 100 mbps on a good day but average 40 mbps. Don't know what it was advertised as but you learn quickly you make do with what's available to you..

Even more annoying I pay for 80mbps internet. I get 40. They have a 40meg package but when I downgrade to that I only get 25....   Edit: line stats when on the 80 meg package for those interested. I dont have a copy of the 40meg stats. Im actually now doing 44 apparently   https://imgur.com/gallery/ZenQF. Honestly, I got the same from my isp for the longest time (xfinity) but when i moved I just bought my own modem and router.   My speeds went up to the advertised speed almost immediately after installing and setting eveeything up. Not sure if yoy are using your cable companies default modem but if you are it might be worth considering.. Ive a pfsense box I use as my main router . I use an Ubiquity Edgerouter X. Great stuff for the home if you know a lot about networking.. I love the ubiquiti gear, I used to install it all the time in my last job. For the price you get a lot of bang for your buck. 
t3_81om0k	0	*	Australia considers banning ISPs from listing internet speeds they cannot provide. Also mobile phone carriers should not be allowed to list their data plan as 'unlimited' when it really isn't. Then none could because there are physics limits. That said, it's bullshit when they say unlimited then you get 2G speeds after 22GB.. Thats still unlimited. They dont say you get max speed for entire unlimited. . How is that unlimited?! That's the complete opposite of unlimited.. If you can use it no matter your data usage, thats unlimited. Throttling doesnt mean its not unlimited. Just means the speed isnt unlimited. .. Limited speed means limited amount. I'm sorry you're stupid.  PS - I can't *use* a lot of the stuff I would otherwise if I'm limited to 2G speeds.. If you still have internet access no matter how much you use, then is unlimited. . You're stupid, illiterate, or both. You ever look up the definition of limited?

I mean its okay in principle but its *completely unenforceable*.   More highly skilled people get more than less highly skilled people. How do you *prove* that the man is getting paid more not due to his skills but due to his gender?. > How do you prove that the man is getting paid more not due to his skills but due to his gender?  Oh that's simple....you just have to believe women are inherently victims and that men inherently victimize women because masculinity is the most harmful attribute humanity has ever produced.   In other words....be a feminist.    . That's not what feminism is, and just because you saw someone say it was doesn't mean it actually is.. Sadly, that is what feminism has become.. No, it isn't. Maybe ask a feminist instead of getting your news from people that hate them. Or maybe judge feminists by their own actions and words... and reach that same conclusion. See my first response

Dual citizens (Iranian-Canadian, Iranian-American) who visit Iran seem to be at high-risk for such things when they visit Iran:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahra_Kazemi  . Going to Iran is generally not a good idea unless you are a Muslim extremist.. You misspelled Saudi Arabia. Same but different Muslims. They just disagree on the cannon of their own fan-fiction. And yes, I equate the heavily religious to the likes of weebs, bronies and what ever you call the people into the awful sonic stuff. . There are definitely many religious hardliners in Iran, however many of the average citizens are quite moderate and love western culture. Its like in the US the average person is accepting and openminded however somehow a creepy cheetoo is the one in charge making the whole country appear to be racist and closeminded. Well it's like any fandom. I mean look at Rick and Morty. When it was a new show people just enjoyed it. Fast forward to today the fan-base is a meme infested cesspool of the lowest common denominator.  Most people who watch the show are normal people, but it's the few insane fans that made the words Rick and Morty cringe worthy. . I frikken love Rick and Morty and havent heard of any meme cesspools... Only discovered it few months ago (yea I live under a rock) so maybe thats why lol. To be fair, the Rick and Morty stuff has died down a bit since the last season ended. But go to deep into the fandom and you'll feel unclean.

Irresponsible pharmaceutical companies will be the root of the next extinction event when they realize they cant keep up with superbugs.   No zombies required . There's more money in medicine for antibiotic resistant superbugs than there is in generic penicillin, why wouldn't they want to breed superbugs?. I like to think nobody is insane enough to intentionally do this. They are probably thinking no deeper than shell out cheap antibiotics in bulk for cash. . Really because that recent discussion on population control on PBS was illuminating. . Education controls population better than anything else.. Sure, Education creates the flow of people that the superbugs and lack of healthcare will kill off. . You know who doesnt care about your education or status? Superbugs .

Syria just responded to an Israeli raid on one of its military bases.   Is shit hitting the fan? . No, they have been doing this for ages now, they just got caught out. That's why they mentioned/made up the drone, that was their excuse for being there.. No excuses are needed for bombing Syria. They chose to be the enemy and insisted on remaining so.. so by that logic no excuse needed for bombing Israel too, all Kosha hay /s. Ive been sitting here waiting for 2 years, be my guest. how about me make it fair and make each country take 1 turn of nuclear roulette, we take North Korea and have them fire 1 nuke at each country if the bomb ends up being a shitter and falls apart which is very possible that country wins.. It's not particularly fair when Israel is the only country in the fight with nukes since they won't be pushed into the sea.. sorta like jelly on toast?

Goddamn, that's eloquent.  ...And then there's Tomi Lahren. . This is not eloquent.  Prayer + action = action.  Why don't we just cut the superstitious bullshit out altogether and just commit to action?. I dont think insulting peoples faith will inspire them to take action. Probably just make them more bitter.  Edited: Word choice. Prayer is dangerous. You do know that people pray hefore they do bad actions, right? If the 9/11 highjackers weren't so into praying, odds are they would not have plunged those planes into the World Trade Center.. Prayer didnt knock down those buildings human action did.  As for their motivation, are you implying that anyone who prays wants to go on a murderous killing spree? Those men were extremist who perverted their viewpoints. The teaching of most major religions are peaceful. . Prayer is at best a waste of time and a mark of stupidity; at worst, prayer is a tool for control and a catalyst for destruction. It serves *no good* in this world.. I must disagree with my friend. If nothing else it shows our support for the survivors of this tragedy. It tell them that they are not alone and they are not friendless. That we hurt with them in some small way. And yes there are other ways to show this support but cannot think of a way that is more genuine.. If you want to show support, go stand outside with a sign that says BAN THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF THE AR-15. Prayer is particularly bad because it perpetuates the stupidity that brings on gun super fandom like we have in the states.

Well, if talks break down, it will effectively be the US being fired from NAFTA, since Canada and Mexico will continue.. ? That wouldn't be good for Canada at all . It would be better than what Trump thinks he wants.  The US is not going to stop buying oil from Canada just because there's a tariff on it thanks to Trump's backward thinking, and if they did, it's not like no one else is going to buy it.  . The United States realistically wouldn't put tarrifs on Canadian oil. The would put tariffs on most Canadian products though.. That won't work out well. We're too used to cheap shit. It will backfire.. Do you actually believe a 1.5 trillion dollar economy (Canada) has any bargaining power against a 18.5 trillion dollar economy (the U.S.)?  Or are you just memeing one-liners because the name Trump is somewhere in that article?. Um, I don't follow your reply.  I said Americans hate paying extra for their imported goods. From China, or Mexico, or Canada. If Trump starts a trade war with any of these nations, Americans will bitch and moan, because they are used to cheap goods.

I've never been a fan of Trudeau and would've preferred a conservative government, however, there are times I like having him around in a Trump presidency.  1) There is of course, this statement that he won't pander to Trump's bullshit demands.  2) I really like the way he plays Trump. The Donald actually think Trudeau is his friend.. you wanted another 4 years of harper?. Conservatives loved Harper. The shit everyone else didn't like about him is why they voted for him. He's right with Mulroney on Prime Ministers I have a very low opinion of, but you'd have to put a gun to my head to get me to vote federal conservative. Their tough on crime bullshit is absolutely nonsensical. . Yeah I think a lot of folks fail to realize just how popular Harper was in Conservative circles. He's perhaps the man you can point to as *the* unifier of the Canadian right wing. He got a lot of flak for being cold and robot like, but imo he was quite a charismatic man who did good by his party.. Like silencing scientists. Seems to me the right doesn't like science and truth. . He wasn't perfect, and I hated a lot of what he did. But the Conservatives seem to be the only party that gives a damn about Western Canada so they get traction here. . Lmfao yeah right. As the saying goes, Canada is a cow. Western Canada is its head where it gets fed. Ontario and Quebec reap the rewards of the West by being the stomachs, and eastern Canada is the rear-end and gets shit on. . Oh no, we support the party that doesn't try to make our side of the country poor and make our business fail after 3 generations. What a shock!

I'm conservative   ew.. This is the most hypocritical statement I have ever read. You are being close minded by not respecting others views while claiming to be progressive. . Nobody has to respect nobody else's views. If your views are terrible, like if you're a conservative, then it's entirely within everyone's right to say so. Striving for progress, or being a progressive, is literally the antithesis of being a conservative, i.e. being ignorant, selfish, and greedy. . You are literally using your own opinions and substituting them for what conservatism actually stands for. You are extremely ignorant, Im not sure how you cant respect another ones views when you clearly have no idea what conservatism  actually is. .

This is why the US cant tamper in Russia, they don't allow their people to actually make decisions.   I'll take a shit show like the 2016 election instead of a total lack of freedom any day.. We have one more option than communists  Edit: I obviously fucked the quote up, but the idea is still in there. Russia isn't even communist.. Don't mind him.  Its the spill over result from fear mongering in post-WW2.  Us vs them.  People just can't get over old paradigms.  Russia has been a capitalist oligarchy for 30 years, it'll take another 100 for people to stop thinking that all of their problems are because they are secretly communist.  . It is not quite that, the issue is westerners tend to conflate communism with socialism and authoritarianism even though all three are genuinely distinct..

That plus just their current societal thought of for the better of everyone definitely more collectivist than the west while we try to build the biggest military than our neighbor.

But this is still more sensible than the US policy, federally speaking. . Yup, most US Republicans need to pull their heads out of their senile asses, stop wasting tens of billions of dollars and end prohibition federally.

What obstacles prevent legalization across the board in Mexico? Is it a cultural thing or just something the leadership doesn't like?. The US gov controls much more than you think. Many in Mexico believe that legalization hasn't been possible because the US is opposed to it.. Maybe they should take control of their own country.  After the asshat we elected you think theyd come to their senses and know we arent helping them.    Honestly, blaming the US sounds like a cop out at this point.

I see their plight but all I can't strongly support it looking at the massive ballooning costs of childcare. You want both of the parents to work, but when one is working just to pay off the childcare costs, they end up just staying at home taking care of the kid because it's cheaper. It's not cheap having kids these days unless you have grandparents chipping in to help take care of them.. Childcare/early learning workers work extremely hard for very little pay. They deserve more. Even fully qualified teachers in early learning centers earn significantly less than equally qualified teachers in a primary/secondary school. That's not right or fair.. > Even fully qualified teachers in early learning centers earn significantly less than equally qualified teachers in a primary/secondary school.

Think of it this way. A teacher who has worked for 5 years could be in a teaching position at an early learning centre planning lessons and teaching kids over a variety of ages, up to and including school age children, and be earning $50kpa.

But you already made that decision before the government did this. What changed for you?   And hell the government hasn't made this decision for people yet.

You always got a letter when you turned 18 anyways, explaining organ donorship. . The big deal is the part where by default your rights to what is done with your own body are forfeit..

t3_7xgogl	0	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. I thought donating was supposed to be voluntary. . It is, if you can freely opt out. People are lazy, this just prevents laziness from depriving someone of life. Your wishes as the donor (or not) are still respected.. Yet you automatically put into the program. Lack of opposition does not equal consent. Could've sworn we already knew that. . It isn't required, not a single person will be forced into donating by a default selection that favors life.  This policy is morally right, because it defaults to valuing life.. Except it auto registers people as donors which they have to opt out of. That means it's not voluntary to donate. The big question is how hard will they ask if the person wants to opt out and how difficult will it be?. Yes, I do hope opt out is reasonably easy. But I'm sure not going to lose any sleep over an inconvenient opt out when it saves lives for no actual cost to the donor.. With that logic, why not make it like the draft? /s. You realize the /s doesn't really make that comparison make any sense, right? They're still nothing similar between this and a draft.

Why don't Jordan or Syria take responsibility for the people they displaced? . I don't give a shit about how legitimate planting flags and drawing borders is.

And, more importantly, that you cannot leave in a long time once you've opted in.. Oh , and if you are in the list. your family can choose to say not to give your organs after you die , so being on the list means really nothing if your spouse says no ;/   and your organs can go to terrorists or settlers..which is why i really refuse to sign up ;/ (or even donate blood ,as i might save the life of my enemy) .

t3_7xgogl	1	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. I view this as a good thing. People here seem to think you won't get very good surgeons and nurses if you're a donor and they'll just let you die. If everyone's a donor then no one is a target . And the idea that they dont try as hard to save you if youre a donor is absolutely 100% false. I work in the field. Organ donation is never on the mind when youre trying to save a life.. It's funny: I've been in a lot of discussion with other Dutch people on organ donation, and it often focusses on things like right to self-determination. I've encountered the doctors will let you die argument exactly zero times.. Probably because its a silly American conspiracy theory (Im American).. > its a silly American conspiracy theory  Yeah, I've lightened up a bit on the conspiracy folks ever since we got a Russian mole elected to be President and nobody seems to care. . >I've lightened up a bit on the conspiracy folks  If you want that cured just take one look at /r/conspiracy . That's so funny, their userbase seems to overlap massively with T_D. Everything democrat or government is a conspiracy, except the Trump-Russia thing, then it's a conspiracy against Trump!. It's such a weird thing for a conspiracy community.

In NL, that would be going to a website, and clicking through 3 screens of options, after logging in with your ID (that you also use for filing taxes). how much does it cost to move.

Ah see, that might be a problem, since we have a merit-based immigration policy, and we don't just accept people from shithole countries like the US.  (Joking aside, just like any other country, you can't just come and work here, it's a very difficult and long process, unless you have a company that really wants you and will vouch for you). Nice reply :)  But yeah I was oblivious to this fact myself until I started looking at countries I would want to move to. Turns out I need to finish this degree if I have any hope. I myself am a fan of a merit based system BUT I also know that the systems being proposed are based on reasons other than merit.. Also, the US has had a merit-based system as long as I cared to look up.  The lottery is only to let a certain amount of people apply, after which the process starts. And your odds are much better, if you have a degree (the higher the better), specific trade skills, or a company sponsoring you. So the whole we need an *x* system is complete and utter bullshit.

Here in Israel, organ donation is voluntary, but there's a policy called don't give, don't get. When doctors have to choose between people who need organ transplants, priority goes to people with organ donor cards.. That policy sounds fair and reasonable. (Not being facetious). Completely agree. You don't need your organs when you die, I don't understand the unwillingness of people NOT to donate them.. Some people argue that if you're in a situation where death is 90% likely but your organs give a 50/50 chance for another to live then triage would dictate letting you die to save the person more likely of surviving, it's kind of a logical fear when you think about it. Organ harvesting isn't 1 person deciding or doing though, it is a panel/team that decides. If there is a chance of meaningful quality of life they aren't going to kill someone for their organs.   I realize there is a real fear of this happening but doctors in that situation want to save YOUR life before just sending you off for harvesting. . Its not the doctors choice though, like you said its a panel. First it is the willingness of the patient or deceased to have their organs donated. If there is NO chance of meaningful life, then the organ harvest panel or doctors are then involved. But there is not one Hannibal like doctor going around deeming what bodies should be harvested, it is a very involved process. . Again im not saying that doctors are going around killing patients, stop using this straw man tactic its very dishonest. Also we arent talking about donors. You wondered why people dont opt in to donate and im trying to provide insight, not debate on ethics or what constitutes life

I dont understand why a person wouldnt donate his organs unless for religious reasons. By donating, youll be able to save someones life, which is THE BEST deed possible, in my opinion. . I know a guy who refuses to donate. He is not allowed to donate blood because he is gay, and says that if society considers his blood unfit for donation, they won't get his organs either.. He's punishing those waiting for transplants because of a shitty decision the government has made? That's a little harsh, don't you think?. I think punishing is too harsh a term to use. Besides, he is refusing in protest to call attention to the double standard.. I've known a lot of people waiting for transplants, some for years. It's absolutely a punishment to have to wait longer. Some die in the process. Would he be able to walk into the room of someone, on the cusp of death waiting a transplant, and tell them he isn't an organ donor because of a personal protest? That's what it boils down to for me.. Well, i can't exactly force him to change his opinion.. Of course, I wasnt expecting you to.. And to be bluntly honest, even if he was a registered donor, i hope he wouldn't get to save anyone like that anyway.

Edit: dont get me wrong: the Catholic Church has a long history of abuse and cover ups - just sayin..

Funny how this foreign megacorporation can't deal with the wage hike but small businesses with small budgets are enthusiastic about making it work. They claim retention and morale are higher with a higher wage. Corporate greed.. It's the franchise owners (who notoriously get screwed) not the corporation.  Franchise owners basically pay for the name and are required to honor the sales and promotions set out by corporate.  It's basically a corporation pushing most all of the liability on to another party.. It is a pattern in *Restaurant Brands International* across the country though, in Tim's and other restaurants. Just earlier this week they found that a Burger King in Alberta had mattresses and seemed to be keeping their underpaid Temporary Foreign Workers in a squalid residence on site (highly illegal).   e: corrected company name. Corporations should be held responsible for what they push their franchise owners to do against stacked odds.. Subway would die out if that happened.   Good..

Yeah when I was in the Phillipines I was shocked to see that there's no such thing as saving garbage for bins.. I haven't been to Bali but I saw the same on Java. Wrappers, lids, etc just chuck it on the ground or in a flower arrangement. I was baffled that people who live there would want to treat their environment that way.. I call BS. Java has garbage collectors built in. . This. Though I once visited C island (a less developed island but not without its own charm) and sadly all the space would periodically run out because there's so much garbage. Huh, I mostly stuck to the ++ islands. They were pretty nice, a little garbage but not much. And it was way faster to get things done than when visiting Java.. The # islands are definitely the best. The residents take care of the trash for you and you don't even have to call them over to do it.. You see, the ++ islands are just like that, if you want them to be. But the problem is that some of the islands, which are critical to the others, can't support the extra population needed.  And on the ++ islands you never pay for anything you don't use.

Considering you could drive a few dozen drones pretty easily with some software and some creativity on the hardware side, and those drones now cost under $500 each. You could do a 40 drone swarm probably for under $30k. Thats no bueno for defense systems IMO. 5ish years ago I watched a video of a home tinkerer who built an auto targeting nerf powered turret with a cheap webcam and some basic robotics. He could not escape it in his back yard it's kill ratio was impressive. I'm not worried about the military vs cheap drones.. A cheapo auto-turret might be fine if you want to shoot anything that moves. In most situations you're going to want to differentiate between friend and foe and bird and squirrel, though. That's where the real cost and complexity comes in.. No you don't. You just want it to not shoot your troops. . I'm pretty sure an air defense gun wouldn't have any trouble with distinguishing between a 10lb flying robot drone and a 200lb human.  Hell, just keep it from being able to shoot below a certain angle and you're fine. Targeting software would be irrelevant if it can't physically aim lower enough hit a person. . Unless the people are concentrated in an area close to the gun, there's no angle high enough to avoid them. What goes up will eventually come down.. When have falling bullets ever been a major concern during combat? Besides, if we're talking about defending a base from an attack, almost every round fired into the air is going to land well outside it's borders.. Probably you're mostly right - I was just trying to say it's not guaranteed to be safe. Having said that, bullets are not typically fired randomly into the sky during combat. And if they land outside the base, that doesn't mean there's no people there. Potentially civilians etc.

Everything in this world is dictated by those with guns to back up their opinions. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel because America says it is.. Yes exactly, people use guns to make their opinions reality. If reality was only dependent on opinions then they wouldn't need the guns now would they?

t3_7s52yf	1	*	Pence, in Jerusalem, says honoured to be in 'Israel's capital'. I don't even understand how one can even argue that Tel Aviv is Israel's capital. I think this whole argument is stupid to begin with. Even before the '67 war, Israel's parliament was in Jerusalem, along with (AFAIK) all government offices. By definition, Jerusalem is its capital. At what point would one argue it wasn't, and why?. The argument is that Jerusalem does not legally belong to any country, and hence, it cannot be the capital of any country.  People disagree on that first part, but it's extremely lopsided. Less than 10 countries (out of 195) accept that Jerusalem belongs to Israel.. >The argument is that Jerusalem does not legally belong to any country, and hence, it cannot be the capital of any country.  Seems like a stupid argument that can't be enforced without taking over the city with a military force.. Nobody is trying to actually enforce it. The reason nobody wants to officially recognize it as belonging to Israel is because it's a huge part of peace negotiations. The idea is that, as part of some kind of ultimate peace resolution, Israel would be willing to compromise on their position on Jerusalem.. That ship is slowly sailing away.. I know. It was already sailing away before this, and this only makes it worse.. Or better, depending on your point of view.. True.

Nope , I am single and jus barely over 50 y.o. ;   I moved to Fl to help care for elderly parents .   I used to design on CAD .   Cannot find a job now , even went back to college & got an Associates .. But if you no income, you should be eligible for Medicaid, exactly for that reason. Have you checked into that? Medicare is for elderly, Medicaid is for the poor. . About 27 states did not 'expand' medicaid' under the AfordableCareAct -  remember the (black) President's health care achivement , other wise known as 'ObamaCAre' ?   I don't even have gas money to drive away from Florida .. Oh, and Florida didn't expand. Fuck that. Are there no hospitals that help people who can't afford care? My state has those hospitals, and we expanded Medicaid.. Nope , what is the first thing that is asked at any medical care facility ?. I know, but we have hospitals who take care of people who can't pay here in Denver.   Man, we need to get you a GoFundMe or something.

So maybe it isnt that we should spend more, but rather fix it to make it less expensive?. I think the point is, universal healthcare is cheaper than what youve got, its crazy you guys dont want it.. Because it's generally shittier like all free shit. Uninsured do have healthcare via their state. A lot of horse shit is being spread here.. >Uninsured have healthcare vxeda their state.  Thats...not true. There are systems that allow the destitute to lower debt or get cash discounts, but not every state covers all people.  Do you have a source for your claim?. Medicaid exists. It's means tested, so if you're upper-middle class and uninsured you're likely not getting any, but it's still a sizable expenditure- more money is spent on Medicaid than on the military, for instance.   And then there's Medicare. . I dont think you understand how those systems work (and the danger of states not expanding Medicare) if you think they cover anyone. As an example, my partner and I dont make enough for good coverage or even for him to see the doctor, but we also are ineligible due to my small income.. Medicaid/CHIP payments are received by 70 million Americans. If these programs don't work, why was there such a big uproar over CHIP over the last few months?   Medicaid and Medicare combine to amount for almost 7% GDP and well over a third of all health care expenditures. If 1.2 trillion dollars is being spent and not covering anything, where, exactly, is that money going?

That's pretty funny actually! *slaps knee while laughing but not too hard because I can't afford to have it checked by a doctor*. To be fair... isnt the US the country that pumps out one of (if not ) the best level of medical care. The US is the one funding most medical advances plus the wait time in the US is faaar shorter than in Britain. I mean yes from a purely money perspective it will seem that Britain has a better system however when quality is taken into account the US generally wins. . No. US maternal mortality is nearly 3x the UK's. We have higher infant & child mortality. More than double hospital acquired MRSA (in 2010) & the last I saw, the US was ranked last for preventable deaths.   Sure, the US is good at innovating & making new discoveries, but the *average* care is mediocre at best.. Im talking wait times for people who get in car accidents and stuff... putting infant mortality on the table is a fair argument but hardly anything of a picture... anyways why the hell am I getting downvoted for a mere inquiry. Talk about a tough crowd . Waiting times are sorted by priority in the UK, if you got into a car accident they wouldn't leave you on the street, you'd get treated immediately. Do some damn research instead of just making shit up..

The brits endlessly complain about the NHS though... can they finally shut the fuck up about it now?. Seriously! The hypocrisy is palpable. You can have socialized healthcare and attempt to wield it as a political club to attack capitalists with, Or you can have socialized healthcare and complain about the quality, and the queue times. But not both.. Would prefer to be complaining about queue times then dying in my bed not being able to pay the $60,000 to get treated. The UK has higher life expectancy then the USA and spends less of its GDP on healthcare and it doesn't leave people dying just because they cant afford it.. The UK has a higher life expectancy because of lifestyle choices, when it comes to actual healthcare, the U.S.'s quality is far better, that's why our cancer survival rate is so much higher.. And what about all the people with un-diagnosed cancer that die to it because they cant afford to go to the doctor?. Late stage cancer would have very noticeable symptoms before killing you. Regardless, I pay for my goods and services, you pay for yours. I say that living paycheck to paycheck barely getting by, I don't expect others to pay for my service.. Do you oppose roads being free at use? . I believe roads should be made by corporations and charge a fee for every use.

This whole thread is such a pretentious socialistic European circlejerk. . Seriously, if you live in the us and have a decent non minimum wage job you can easily afford to pay for health insurance. But in America your healthcare costs more and your results are worse. It's not a good deal for citizens. . My healthcare has been absolutely fine. My insurance covered all of the injuries i've ever sustained and they've all healed fine afterwards.. Great, so you paid more money for the same result. Congratulations!. Wrong, government job, comes with health insurance.. So in other words, you DO like government health insurance.   Also, you need to know, you are still paying for that insurance. If it wasn't offered to you, your paycheck would be a LOT higher than it is now. . I like it when people earn it. You shouldn't be insured just for existing and being a leech on society. My pay is fine where it is and i actually enjoy my job so losing a bit for my own healthcare is fine.

Yeah, but here in America we have the right to do such things.  Not so much in the UK. The Government decided for them..

Health care in the U.K.:  1) sorry. That triple bypass you need is elective, so we wont pay for it. You can get private healthcare in the UK. If you want to pay for it, you can get it. No one's stopping you from having a medical procedure done there if you have the money. Did you know that?. Ive had people say this before, but it makes no sense. Why should you have to pay for health care when you are already paying for health care?   Thats like paying full price for a video game and only getting half of it and then being charged full price again to get the rest of it. . So like buying any AAA title these days then?  But seriously, the NHS has limits of what it covers. Those limits are extremely generous. You want something outside the limits, you can use your private insurance.  Incidentally, has there ever been something not covered by an insurance policy in the US?. > So like buying any AAA title these days then?  Only one from EA.

They funded the Black Hand.

Are you implying that the death of the arch Duke isn't the cause of the invasion of Belgium by the Germans?. Well to kinda answer for them, the assassination was just the spark which lit the fire. The build-up to the tense situation in Europe in 1914 goes all the way back to the congress of Vienna in 1815. There were heaps of other things occuring during the 19th century which disturbed the balance of power.. Im aware my point is that the event that caused the world to go from no world war.

He didnt even know that they. . There was a riot going on at 2 AM. This person had previously been shot in a prior riot. He was not going about his business.. No bullet wounds found but even if your fact is true, it is absolutely no reason for the Army to assault people. But Im sure that there will be additional facts will come out to attempt to justify the MURDER OF AN UNARMED CIVILIAN. Yep, Im sure he was running toward soldiers at 2 AM during a riot with a large metal rod .. for exercise? Yep, that's it.  [As far as the claim of no bullet holes was by Haaretz, a pro-Palestinian Israeli newspaper, the IDF did not confirm this](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-man-killed-during-arrest-after-he-attacked-soldier-idf-says/).. How blatantly ignorant some can act, you want me to believe that he knowingly ran towards soldiers who were firing there weapons, and. large metal rod you havent or are clearly ignoring what is shown in in the video, which illustrates just how wrong you are.

The fact that they can afford proverbial limousines should say something about the validity of their ideas.. Yeah like a racially homogenous society. And what do you say about Canada? Similar social situation, and one of the most racially diverse countries on the planet. Take Toronto, for instance. It is ranked the 4th most livable city in the world, has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, yet is over 50% foreign born. . Number 26th in GDP compared to US's 11.. The US has 10 times the population.. Sorry, GDP per capita.. At the cost of a broken healthcare system and fewer social benefits, while still ranking the same in [HDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) and significantly lower in the [democracy index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).

I understand their point but if we are going to set the shithole bar at America, then the list of countries in that category becomes far greater than what Trump listed.. The US has the highest incarceration rate in the entire world. That bar is pretty low.. Then why do so many people risk their lives to come here?. Jobs. In other words, opportunities that arent offered in their countries.. Yes. But Norway has jobs. Good jobs.  So basically the US is stuck with immigrants from 'shithole' countries, because they are the only ones that can get better opportunities than they have at home.   EDIT: And that does say something about what the US actually have to offer.. Question:Why dont immigrants go to Norway or other European countries then?. American companies hire outside the US and there's a lot of them?  Also, people do go to Europe, but Americans don't meet them as often for obvious reasons.

I would say the leadership of palestine spending money on crappy weapons rather than infrastructure, education, or the economy is the biggest slap in the face for peace. What weapons do you think that the PA is purchasing? . Crappy rockets. The PA has never fired 1 rocket in it's entire history. . Cool story. /u/incendiaryblizzard is correct here. During the Second Intifada, The P.A. has been involved in the planning, funding and execution of terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, but they have never invested in rockets.   Fatah in Gaza has launched rockets against Israel, but they are technically not a part of the P.A.. You know their investments?  Please share. It's a common term. The P.A. has never been caught or even accused of building or using rockets.

Oh dear, you don't read do you. Try google. It's great. Start with the NRA and Russian cash. .  If cash donations prove collusion  ... the Clintons have some explaining....

They've had years to do the paperwork to stay, visas, proper citizenship.   I mean, if they're retarded I feel bad for them but if they're too lazy to do some paperwork . What paperwork were they supposed to do?. Buying plane tickets to GTFO.. But the US government kept telling them they could stay.. But it did not say that it was permanent or irrevocable.  If you are being afforded protections by a program, perhaps it would serve well to understand the limitations of the program, and what that program actually provides.  So yes, it kept telling them they could stay, but it didn't guarantee that it was guaranteed that they would be allowed to stay.. Yea, I'm not claiming it's illegal for us to deport them. Just that it's a dick move.  When a government keeps letting you stay on an indefinite basis, you assume they aren't just going to change their mind out of nowhere one day and kick you out.. By your logic bouncers shouldn't remove unruly fuckers from clubs/bars. I'm pretty sure from the unruly fucker's perspective the bouncer is being a dick. But does that stop the bouncer from doing his job? NO.

They have kids and start their entire lives here, and then out of nowhere they are told to GTFO 15 years later.. Its almost as if they were never citizens to begin with.   What happened to people voluntarily returning to their homelands without overstaying their welcome?. They weren't aware they had overstayed their welcome until just now, since the US government kept giving them 18 month extensions for nearly two decades.. So they just assumed 18 month extensions would continue indefinitely?   Wow.. Yea, probably. Can you think of other examples of people being kicked out of a country after being allowed to be there for so long?. Yes, Europe is deporting refugees back to Africa and the Middle East in droves. . People who were accepted as refugees and who have been there for 15 years? Got a source where I can get some more information?
t3_7ozg9b	0	*	Trump Administration Rules That Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave, Officials Say. From what I gathered from NPR this morning, sending these 200,000 Salvadorans back is going to eventually create a refugee crisis of even bigger proportions.  Nearly a fifth of all money in El Salvador is US dollars being sent home to relatives.  They also have one of the highest murder rates in the world already.  This is going to be a nightmare in about 2-3 years.. or 200,000 well educated people can help things slowly turn around in El Salvador. Where did you get the idea they are well educated?. That's the argument Democrats always make.  They always say these are hard working people who have been educated here.....blah, blah. Thats the argument about Dreamers.  To qualify to be a Dreamer you have to be educated here.    The majority of the 200,000 Salvadorans who are losing their protected status are not Dreamers.  . No they are all dreamers. You think you get the news about being sent from a first world country back to your dangerous country and not dream its not real?. Question are you serious? These are two completely different programs and two completely different people. These 200,000 people are probably more educated than the average Salvadoran, but their skills won't make a difference in basically a civil war. It's like adding a bucket of water to a wildfire, it might help a little bit but it won't do anything. . I mean I dont see how you can take my comment anyway but as a joke? Like its a joke about them dreaming about staying in america instead of getting sent to a third world.  also why is civil war value the measure for staying in america?
t3_7ozg9b	0	*	Trump Administration Rules That Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave, Officials Say. The TPS concept has me confused right now. If the status is supposed to be temporary, then these people can expect it to be revoked at any time yet now that it is revoked there is controversy. What is the government supposed to do in this case? As messed up as it may seem to send back hundreds of thousands, I do see the reasoning behind it.. It was probably explained to them in black and white when they entered the program that they would have to go home one day. Seems that they are just upset at the rules.. There are some individuals who've had TPS for 20 years and built entire lives. The government simply waited too long.. The government didnt wait, the program has been extended in 18 month intervals for years. This didnt just spring up all of the sudden.. Though this is true, can you blame the person who has built their life here and contribute to our society or do you blame the gov't for allowing that to happen. . I dont blame the people, the Salvadorians are in a tough spot but they still have to go home when the government says. . And this will destabilize El Salvador further, cause the already godawful crimerate to climb even higher, and leave a lot of children in political limbo.  There is no positive outcome to this scenario.  It's only a matter of how fucked up can it get.. If these people will increase crime in El Salvador then how can you say you want them here instead? 
t3_7ozg9b	1	*	Trump Administration Rules That Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans Must Leave, Officials Say. The compassionate conservative right. . Where were the complaints when Obama ended TPS for multiple countries?. Which countries were those? (genuinely asking - could find no record of Obama ending TPS for any country). Sierra Leonne, Guinea, Sudan, Liberia. Ahh, thank you. I was confusing some dates there.   The reason why Obama ending TPS for these countries was not as big of a deal was because in their cases, TPS served it's original purpose of providing very temporary protection for those citizens. About 3 years worth.   For El Salvador, it has been 17 years. At this point, ending TPS poses much bigger issues.. You honestly believe that Obama would be getting this scrutiny if he had repealed it, let's say, last year?  Other Presidents failing to act does not automatically make those people US citizens.. Yes, I do believe Obama would have faced scrutiny. Maybe not as passionately, but there would have still been some.  So what does make a person a citizen? The geography of where their mother was when they were born, something 100% out of their control? Decades of allegiance? Falling in love with an American? . It sure isn't just being allowed to live somewhere on a temporary basis.  They had opportunities to become green card holders during their 17 years stay.  Arbitrary rules made by feelings sure as hell isn't a way to run a country.

I was reading about this and thinking boy I hope he isn't replaced by someone crazy, and then I wondered if that's how the rest of the world feels about America every four years... . The 'crazy' part had never worried us until now. Before we just hoped americans didn't elect someone too stupid to negotiate with.. And now we miss Bush. The irony is staggering. This is the guy who started a war. The Donald ... in all likelihood he might piss off every ally America has and screw every trading agreement for America First! idiocy. No one will want to trade with you then. . As long as the trade brings in money, everyone will trade with the US. It would need a mixture of Hitler, Trump and Kim Jong Un as new president to make that universal truth go away.. Don't you know, Trump is much worse than Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Kim Jong Un combined.  Don't believe me?

Just curious what's out there. Me and most people I know use Instagram almost exclusively . Can someone explain the difference between instagram and Facebook? When you boil it down, it just seems like the same shit. . Less ads, no text posts, not as busy (in regards to the interface), you mostly only see what you follow (as opposed to what others might repost), it's less work to keep up with compared to facebook. I stopped using instagram as much when they decided change the newsfeed to some stupid algorithm instead of just showing posts chronically. It's moving towards Facebook style.

And not all that I oppose is evil. But there are acts of evil perpetrated by the Tory party. . Wouldnt it be possible to argue, there is a history of evil perpetrated from every side of the political spectrum historically in both the UK and the World?. Possibly but I'm not sure what your point would be after that. My point is that the Torys *continue* to do evil - might as well carry on using that word now we've started. . Okay. I dont think were going to have a fruitful discussion but my point was just that demonisation of anyone who isnt explicitly evil in doctrine, Nazis for example, is not useful.. I think common ground could be met if you admit the Torys are commiting acts of evil, which you tentatively implied you agreed with in you're previous comment. Then we could talk about how we people can protect themselves from it, and fundamentally how we can stop it from happening. . That wasnt really what I was seeking. I was just pointing out that looking at an article about a deplorable person and immediately stating theyd be an ideal member of a group you disagree with isnt that rational or helpful.

They dont train just to run fast, they train to run fast with 40kg of luggage on their backs and heavy boots on their feet. If thats your goal then maybe some training with weight is a good idea..

Companies are firing perverts and sexual harassers, which is great, but those who cant find any bad behavior to punish are casting around angrily looking for random things to attack.xa0  making it sound like women are still the problem? cool! maybe if we weren't so inherently seeped in rape culture men wouldn't be so reactionary about this.  . Just curious about your assertion. Whats your definition of rape culture? By percentage, what is your estimate on how many men uphold, propagate, and participate in rape culture? What percentage of women?. I'd argue that all of us, at some point, are upholding or participating in rape culture. I don't think our society actively does enough to get people to respect each other, or practice good consent. we all manipulate to get what we want. . Ixb4ll reiterate MeasuredWords question,  What is Rape culture? How do you, Jade_onehitter define it? For instance, rape gangs in the Congo that went about raping and murdering women, in gangs, without any consequence for years and years, thatxb4s rape culture to me. Do you think theres a difference between the Congo and The West, or basically the same?. lovin the downvote party!!  I'm not trying to say gangs in the Congo raping are the basically the same as men abusing their power in workplace or social situations. I definite it as a culture that sees women as lesser, uses their power over them to manipulate and get what the way, little to nothing is done to change that notion. . its because you're flat out calling all men rapists or complicit in it, thats horrendously wrong and we are entitled to speak out against it. we are all complicit, not just men BTW!. how so? i am a gay man and i'd really like to know how i am complicit in the rape of other people(especially women), having endured sexual assault at the hands of both a man and woman i find it hard to process that i am to blame/complicit by virtue of the fact i am male

Is there a criminal investigation open on Porter? . I don't believe so. It's still a background investigation.. It seems so weird that if shit was creditable, charges wouldnt already have been filed. I dont know the ins and out of this but, is it reasonable that if charges havent been filed by now, maybe things are not what CNN is painting them to be. We are talking about a couple years ago. . One of his ex-wives has a court-granted restraining order against him. . Why is he not in jail?. His ex-wife never reported to police that he had given her a black eye.  It's pretty much the norm for people to not call the cops on their spouse even when being physically abused. The restraining order was for him refusing to leave her residence in violation of their separation order. . Ok. Then on paper , what is he guilty of? Nothing? . Hes not charged with any crime currently or anything like that. Character flaw?

You have to be pretty fucking stupid. Wait..................................  I keep on forgetting he is pretty stupid. Current climate.  Giving compliments is now news worthy and causes uproar.. The comment was offensive and childish, you're OK with it? Pathetic.. Woah there bud. Personal attacks and insults arent cool. What part of this is offensive by the way? Im just asking questions. I never said I was okay with anything. Im indifferent because so far this isnt newsworthy.. The comment to the woman; a highly trained analyst was childish and offensive. First he asked where she was from; her response; New York. Asked a 2nd time, her response was Manhattan. So he asked instead; Where are YOUR people from?   Stupid, childish and offensive.

From a Republican perspective, Trump is not an insane maverick who gatecrashed their party, although that's a narrative that's been going around since the election. In reality, Trump is everything that the Republicans support and endorse.. Very true. He just actually says it instead of using the obvious codes the rest of his party uses. . They fucking love it. The whole he just says what we're all thinking thing is legit. They are thinking that. They just can't grasp that the rest of us fucking aren't. Like at all. . Dude. Lets be real here. Living in Haiti must suck. There is 0% denying that unless your purposefully trying to be contrarian.  The problem isnt what he said, its how he said it. . Hey, the T_D brigade is here!. Wrong. Never posted in T_D in my life, and have it blocked from my front page. When presented with an opposing argument, the first thing you do is instantly dismiss it. That's sad af. Oh you just happen to show up where they do, parrot their opinions and agree with them on most everything. Right.

I dunno, not wanting to feel ashamed all the time seems like a good reason not to follow trump . You allow what someone else says or does make you feel ashamed? That sounds like an issue with you perhaps you need to seek professional help.. I get the impression your passive aggressive sarcasm reflects both a childish attitude about therapy (however shit and profit based our mental health system is) and an individualism of that same immature nature incapable of seeing the utility and empathetic nature of collective guilt and as in this case, of being ashamed for the failure of a group of which you are a part.

And it's funny how the resulting conversation will revolve around the right to spout said opinion without ever suggesting that if education were improved maybe the opinions would improve? . > Opinions  ...  > Improve  I don't think you know what that first word means.. There are some opinions that a usually only held by the ignorant. Education changes that

China. > Just so we're clear here, the US has never had a self-imposed famine resulting from government malfeasance  Ehhh... I'm certain the US's government is much much less evil than China's government, but let's remember where we butchered the herds of bison to starve out the Native Americans.. Natives weren't our own people.  That was also 150 years ago, not caused by a modern state.. Oh ok. So it's okay to massacre them. It wasn't ok, I don't know where you got that from. You said natives weren't our people, implying that it was okay what the govt. has done to them. It's one thing to kill people during war, that's an inevitability.  It's another to murder millions of your own people through incompetence and reform.. Not disagreeing with you there. In war, it's kill or be killed.   But it's another to disown an entire population and subject them to brutality. Trail of Tears comes to mind.   Though to be fair, it was a time when lynching black people was considered cool

While the US may not have the greatest political system  in the world, China really isn't in a position to lecture ANYONE on democracy.. However they ARE in a position to lectire us on the benefits to their one party system, a benefit that is getting more and more evident with everything trump says or does . The benefits of grinding people into mush and drain the remains in the sewer and ban any acknowledgement of the event. Just 1 benefit of their one party dictatorship. You sound like a bitter ex girlfriend. China's never going to acknowledge that, so let it go . That is the dumbest argument Ive ever heard. . Well, you don't have to let it go, you could just stay a China hater forever. I guess that's what you've decided on . They crush thousands of people with tanks, and to this day they ban any mention of it. Yea I guess Im not going to just let that go.. I'm not going to debate it with you, that was a shitty thing, and whoever ordered it will burn in hell, but I live in a China and consider their current government to be very forward thinking and they've even done a massive effort to weed out corruption the last few years. I trust their leader to do the right thing far more than I do of Trump, or many other world leaders right now

I mean, if they get a free vacation, they're likely one of the thousands affected by it.... If they're happy about it then they're financially comfortable. A lot of people aren't. . They're comfortable now, but that doesn't mean they have money to spare to send others also impacted by it.      It's just that your comment would be better suited toward those who aren't impacted by it and seems oddly misplaced when aimed toward someone who is impacted.. It's a comment aimed at a person happy about a situation that clearly affects thousands of people in a negative way. . It impacts them in a negative way as well. They don't have an income at this time either (unless they have a significant other or a second job). Also, vacation time is a very rare thing in the United States, being happy about having a vacation isn't a bad thing.

On the other hand, you have getting run over by tanks.  *Decisions, decisions*.. Or taking a great leap forward, and killing off millions of your own people.. Does nobody actually understand that thats not the same system that China has at the moment? Its like saying America is still under rule by the King. . If we're not going to hold them accountable for killing off 10-50 million of their own people then I don't want to hear anyone bring up shit America has done in the past.. Nobody said anything about not holding then accountable. It's just not relevent to what is being talked about. We're talking about their current government which has its host of other issues but is not responsible for the things that happened during the great leap forward. . I find it very relevant because China has a huge history of treating their people like shit.  Their human rights record is still garbage.  They're the last people on this planet that have a right to say anything about other governments.. You had slaves. Is there a convenient limit on how far back in time we're allowed to go?. Sure let's go back a year and see who still has slaves.

Maybe you should read some books this shit doesn't happen in China. Christ.. All the rich chinese fleeing to US, Canada, NZ,etcis because the country is so free and democratic. Only the poir really like it I guess. . Man, the 600,000 expats in China must love slavery. . Just shows people value money over freedom is all.. I'm not saying anything about any country in general, but freedom means jack-shit to anyone who is hungry and poor. Stop peddling this meaningless word around because that's all the information your tiny skull can contain.

They have been in my local Walmart for atleast a year. they dont have toys in them but they do have hard candy.. I guess that's one way to get around it. I wasn't even aware that the were taken out of stores, we ate those all the time as kids. Catchy song too. . i don't remember when they went away but they did replace the toys with hard candy before they disappeared but it wasn't good enough for who made the ban. but seems to have been changed recently.

t3_818dhp	1	*	EU says it will impose trade 'countermeasures' against US goods in retaliation to Donald Trumps new tariffs. US is slapping steep 'America First' tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.. Don't forget when this was talked about in 2001 the EU had targeted tariffs of their own on swing states. So instead of targeting just US goods they had planned on targeting US goods or products from states that would hurt the people in charge and get an administration change. Those tariffs were never implemented on either side but we can expect the same thing here.. good. whatever the EU can do to flip the house and senate to democrat, would be a massive help. Hey EU, you listening? We have one party owned by the Russians, and we need them out of power.. So you're ok if a foreign entity meddles in our election so long as it's your side that is getting the benefit of it?  Sounds a little hypocritical don't you think?. Apple's and oranges. Targeted sanctions aren't nearly the same as what the Russians did. . What if one day, the EU changes its mind, decides they like America being handicapped and decides to use sanctions to swing the election to a worse candidate in the future?  . > decides they like America being handicapped  The US are our largest trade partner and we are theirs. The EU doesn't want the US handicapped and anyone with any common sense in the US doesn't want the reverse. This is why the EU has only had to threaten punitive measures for the US to back down in the past.. Indeed.  However, my point still stands.  It's a weak point in our system when a foreign economic power can put pressure on a few key points to swing an election.  It is no less dangerous than the information warfare Russia has been waging.  . Foreign powers making it IN the US electorate's interests to vote for a candidate, is not the same as foreign powers manipulating the electorate so they vote AGAINST their own interests.

The school threatened to punish all the students that walk out of class, and a bunch of teachers scheduled tests that were worth a huge percentage of your grade. We still got up and walked out. Our grades for the year seemed less important than the lives of the students that were being discriminated against. . How many colleges were you kept out of as a result of those missed tests? Likely none. . Colleges don't give a shit about qualifications though. Can you read and write and are you willing to take out $100k in loans? . Depends on the college.  If it's a private school, then you're correct.  If you're relying on in-state tuition for a public school then definitely your grades and test scores matter.. What are you talking about? The top schools in the country are all private, and they definitely care about grades. . >The top schools in the country are all private  You're right. And you illustrated the main problems with generalizations. So, pedantry aside, my point was that there are a lot of private schools that have lax academic standards in contrast to their monetary commitments, or at the very least, will overlook your academics under the right circumstances (i.e. dontions).. Sure, the dog shit ones that no one with a brain is going to anyways. . Maybe. I can't speak on how many of them are dog shit, but I know for me locally the University of San Francisco has that reputation. It's partly why they call it the University of Spoiled Foreigners.

t3_7yh6ku	1	*	Former Trump aide Rick Gates to plead guilty; agrees to testify against Manafort, sources say. Manafort obviously isn't the big fish, but he wasn't a cooperator. This can serve as additonal leverage on Manafort to cut a deal and cooperate against the next person up the food chain. . Manafort is key in that he's got the paper trail for many individuals.. I think Kushner is more likely the key, he's the one who managed the big data operation and that's where the indictments on Friday were taking aim  Will Manafort hang for Kushner though? It's no great secret that they don't like each other.. Kushner being indicted would set Trump off in a way no amount of congressional GOP pleading could stop. I'm sure he's getting ready to blanket pardon everyone involved of any Russian collusion whether it's true or it's not, fire Mueller, and hit the campaign trail with Putin's wind at his back in 2018.. If Trump pulls that then we would have one of the fastest impeachments ever.. One would hope so, but some Republicans would have to go against their party.. Republicans go against each other and their party all the time.  Much less unity, discipline, and party loyalty than the Democrats.

Having people you love tell you to fuck off is gutting.. I think religion has a lot to do with it. It definately can, although my uncle is gay and came out maybe 30 years ago, and my grandparents(his parents, hardcore christians) were so accepting of it That it weirded him out and he moved across the country. He only moved back recently for my grandfathers 70th birthday.. He wanted them to be unaccepting of it?. He wanted them to accept him, but they made it very weird and awkward for him apparently by how open they became about it. Asking him about his boyfriends and such, he thought they were being condescending over all.. How many queer people dreamed about getting the reaction your uncle threw away?. My mother had a similar reaction when she came out to me. My reaction wasn't what she expected - I didn't flip out. So she did.

t3_7v4rup	1	*	A Suspected Serial Killer May Have Targeted Torontos Gay Village For Years: Toronto police think theyve caught a serial killer.. I read this from another article but the Toronto police are also concerned there's more victims that could have not been reported missing either because their families haven't reported it (if they were gay and disowned) or men who travelled to Toronto (for Pride or just visiting) that would only get reported missing from their hometown but that information might not reach the Toronto police. . People are still disowning gay family members? WTF, it's Canada, and it's 2018!  I'm genuinely sorry if anyone has been shunned by their families. That's a terrible pain to experience. Having people you love tell you to fuck off is gutting.. I think religion has a lot to do with it. It definately can, although my uncle is gay and came out maybe 30 years ago, and my grandparents(his parents, hardcore christians) were so accepting of it That it weirded him out and he moved across the country. He only moved back recently for my grandfathers 70th birthday.. He wanted them to be unaccepting of it?. He wanted them to accept him, but they made it very weird and awkward for him apparently by how open they became about it. Asking him about his boyfriends and such, he thought they were being condescending over all.. How many queer people dreamed about getting the reaction your uncle threw away?. Way too many. That was so long ago too though. They are all normal now.

Democratic process was only introduced in HK in 1995, two years before the British handover back to China. The elections have always been a farce.. You realize that means Hong Kong was democratic for more than 20 years right ? Which means an entire generation of adults grew up in a democracy. So no it was not always a farce.. You realize the British controlled Hong Kong as a colony for over a hundred years right? Giving them Democracy two years before the Chinese handover was a spit in their face.  This is manufactured and the cries for democracy in HK are far and few between. It's a minute percentage of the population and only gets the coverage it does is because it aligns with Western ideologies.. All other coverage is blocked by the Chinese government, how else would it get coverage?. HK press isn't blocked at all. International press in HK still have the same freedoms they've always had.

Not as long as world renowned lizard person, and proud destroyer of physical hearts, and owner of one that's not his own, Dick Cheney has any say in the matter.. Not as long as 90% of Americans use gas or diesel powered vehicles, either.. If I could afford to go electric, I would. Unfortunately, it's expensive and most Americans don't make nearly enough to buy in.. If electric cars got the subsidy money oil companies get, i wonder how cheap they could be.. Realistically probably not cheap enough. People dont just buy new cars on a whim, they would have to genuinly be dirt cheap to get any significant percentage of the population to buy a new car.. People buy new cars all the time. If they only bought electric cars instead it'd be problem solved.. There's also not a great selection yet.

It may be time to have a worldwide internet blockade of Russia.  The Kremlin regime is toxic and waging all-out war on democracy around the world.. Bro even I'm a noob when it comes how the Internet works.  But you can't do that.  Their are way to many routes to connect outside of your country specially if your backed by government.  They can use satalite, route to a new any country that isn't blockaded, etc.   Someone more knowledgeable can explain better. . New offensive capabilities evolve new defensive capabilities.  Step one in stopping the Kremlin's war on democracy is to actually try in the first place, which is not really happening yet.  Efforts to combat it are fragmentary, disorganized, and not strategic.    . We need a new military wing, like how after WW2 we created and consolidated the Air Force. We need a cyber command military arm. The selective security forces dont want to surrender their portion of the budget and the authority and capability, this was the problem after WW2. The air force general & Eisenhowers authority are the only reason that airforced was created. . We have a cyber command now.. Not the same thing. We need to consolidate our forces into one place. Now we have 20+ organizations redundantly doing the same thing not in smooth coordination.   Cost and effective ability are both terrible.

It's not the same, videos have far more power for action and change than words. Look at the Ray Rice case and compare his punishment and public awareness before and after the video was released.. You think ESPN played that Ray Rice video on loop 24/7 to create awareness?  . Like I quoted above, I'm replying to this portion of your commnet:  >You can get that information out to the world just fine without putting a video online of her dying.  Yea, my point is that by having the girl's video public, it creates more awareness and action regardless of what the media's intentions are.. I don't know what you mean by awareness and action to be honest.  They already caught the guy and the video didn't have to be on the internet for them to do so.  They knew his name.   . Video drives public attention and outcry, this leads to a higher chance of justice being properly served.  A lot of Saudis commit a lot of violent crimes in other countries. A lot of them get away with it. So having the video drive public attention and awareness equates to more chance of justice being served.

Can you really get paid to be a monk? What do they do that differs from a priest or clergyman?. Monks do get a wage, but its probably not a lot, housing food and all of that is included and most of them took a vow of poverty, so there is not much to spend money on.  . Interesting...

Then why did you claim it was the definition of biology.... It was the definition field header when I copied and pasted.. Okay, well as long as herd immunity is maintained their children aren't actually significantly less fit. You're altering the environment to one they're less adapted to in your scenario, that's not the same as them being unfit. You're using the eugenics version of Darwinism
t3_7sdvqz	1	*	Ontario landlords want the right to immediately ban the use of pot in rental properties when recreational weed is legalized this summer, arguing they should be allowed to change tenants existing leases to stop the drug from being consumed in their units.. I'm not opposed to our legalization of weed, but I want to be sure that all current tobacco smoking rules still apply to it.  *Edit*  For the record I'm aware that not all cannabis is smoked.  I'm only worried at the smoked kind.  If you 'foul' the air around others then limits need to be placed.  If you want to eat your brownies then go right ahead.  And please share.  ;). So ignore the laws and smoke tabbaco and weed in your apartment like nothing changed? Like everyone that smokes already does regardless of laws?  Got a 20ft away from building smoking law here, people still smoke inside, because it's cold outside and i ain't smoking out there man.. Not gonna lie, it annoys the shit out of me when I smell cigarettes in my apartment complex. Call me uptight, but I hate it and it reminds me of my racist Grandma's house. If you are smoking weed/cigs inside in a building and it's against the rules and people can smell it, then you are being inconsiderate.. You are not uptight, it is a God awful smell. I hate stepping out for fresh air and some hick is smoking a cigarette and that is all you smell. . Cause only hicks smoke cigarettes.... . Cause it was a personal anecdote, Edgelord. I live in a hick area. 9 times out of 10 when someone is smoking a cigarette, it's a hick doing so. . I picture you sliding your fedora back on  your head in frustration as you angrily lean forward to write this comment, one glistening drop of ragesweat dripping from your face.. Such cutting edge insight, from u/PM__Me_ur__tits. I see you even have the double underscores to differentiate yourself from the other neckbeard begging for titty pics with the same name. How cute.
t3_7sdvqz	1	*	Ontario landlords want the right to immediately ban the use of pot in rental properties when recreational weed is legalized this summer, arguing they should be allowed to change tenants existing leases to stop the drug from being consumed in their units.. smoking is banned  same rules should apply  seniors with copd and breathing issues, easy enough to justify  so just ban smoking it. I'm guessing medical weed users would claim it's medical therefore they need to smoke it for their health, which would distinguish it from regular smoking. but why smoke it  smoking isn't pharmacological superior to any other method  . Not everyone has hundreds of dollars for a proper vape? Edibles aren't a direct replacement for smoking it, it's a completely different effect, depending on what condition you're trying to treat edibles could be highly effective or useless compared to smoking.    Edit: someone please show me a high quality flower vape for cheap I would LOVE to see it.  Those downvoting are clueless. hundreds of dollars for a proper vape  ?????  I bought one for $40, a cartridge for $25 (or very often for less, as in Cali weed dispensaries are quite generous).   Please tell me if I'm missing some ridiculously high quality $200-300 shit, because my wax pen gets me baked as fuck-all after like 4-5 hits, after a tolerance break in 2 hits.. I would love to see how long that 40$ vape lasts you man.  I've gone through 3+ portable type vapes ranging from $40-200, they all crapped out on me after only 3 months max. Then I bought a stand up vape that wasn't portable for approximately 300$ and it worked beautifully and never broke. But that's a lot of money obviously. . I've had mine for 4 months and use it daily.  Hasn't had any issue so far.   I have had one poop out on me after 2 days, though it was because I was stupid and just left it on all day instead of turning it off when I was done.. You're probably lucky to have made it that far.
t3_7tf98w	0	*	Germany's Merkel warns of increased anti-Semitism on Holocaust Remembrance Day. It might be difficult to understand that there could be antisemitism in Germany in this day and age, so here is [a short Deutsche Welle documentary on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Lm0DUk2-A) that was released yesterday.. How about Russian Nazi's? That's more  baffling to me.. There are American Nazis too, bizarrely. We fought a war against those guys, it's a pretty major source of national pride for us.. To be honest - I don't care as much about American Nazi's. Considering how many Russians Nazi's have killed vs. Americans, there's no comparison what so ever.. not only that, but most American Neo-Nazis seem to be redneck Militias/Groups who don't really commit too many crimes out of fear of serious jailtime.  whereas russian ones are far more active.. >Redneck   Using derogatory slurs  or generalizing doesn't make your point true. The number of actual nazis is very small - somewhere between five to ten thousand. . are you one of those country music people who use redneck as a term of pride?. Are you one of those people who use racial slurs to generalize a group of people? As for me, I am an Indian immigrant living in Usa.
t3_7tf98w	0	*	Germany's Merkel warns of increased anti-Semitism on Holocaust Remembrance Day. Antisemitism is exploding in Europe. No wonder Jews are fleeing to Israel. Look at Sweden, Arabs march the streets opening chanting death to Jews and are fire bombing Synagogues, of course there are no repercussions for this behavior. . Links Please? . https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/opinion/sweden-antisemitism-jews.html  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5197847/Rise-antisemitism-Sweden-linked-Trumps.html  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/europe/sweden-synagogue-molotov-cocktail.html  http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11962878. Read your own sources. There were a maximum of 10 people, palestinians, in that 'march' and they threw molotov cocktails that did not damage anything.  In reaction to Trump's dumbass decleration that Jurusalem is Israel's by the way. So it's more resistance against the US president than anti-semitism. . Are you implying fire bombing synagogues because of a trump decision is acceptable?. No, I am saying the core of the protest was against the recognition that Jurusalem belongs to Israel. . Why would you throw fire bombs at a synagogue in another country to protest something the United States did? That doesnt make sense. Are you sure these guys are not just ass holes and the fire bombing would have happened no matter what?. Of course they are assholes. But if you know anything about middle eastern protests, specifically palestinian and isreali, then you could have predicted with 100% certainty that the US president making such a claim would incite mobs. 
t3_7oacuz	0	*	Ontario premier calls Tim Hortons heir 'a bully' over wage actions - The children of the Tim Hortons coffee chain founders cutting paid breaks and staff benefits for employees after a minimum wage hike really flies in the face of fairness, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne told CBC News on Thursday.. You know what really flies in the face of fairness? Selling off crown corporations that were designed to provide services to residents of the Country/Province at a fair cost so that you can pay off a small portion of your sky rocketing Provincial debt while the constituents of your Province (both affluent and not) pay escalating hydro bills. . You're right, I have no idea how people don't see through her obvious voter pandering with this statement.   Yes, these Tim Hortons owners are doing something wrong but Wynne is the last one that should call anyone out on something like this. You can't expect employers to just absorb a 20% hike in wages over night without a change in the way they do business.... The employers did delay the wage hike for years, which is why it's so steep.. In comparison to the rest of Canada and the US, Ontario had a pretty high minimum wage, actually.. But was it fair compensation? That's what matters.. What part of NA capitalism seems fair to you? . > In comparison to the rest of Canada and the US, Ontario had a pretty high minimum wage, actually.  What was the your point with that statement?

Because fixing climate change would require huge changes in the way a lot of goods are manufactured / procured, and those changes cost money to put into place, while also likely reducing profit margins. Being enviornmentally clean is rarely the cheap option.. When considering all the options, being environmentally clean is still the chear**er** option.

He's reduced the national debt by how much in just over a year? The stock market is at a high that's never been seen. But, yeah, you're right. He has zero clue what he's doing. . You think the debt going down in his FIRST year is his doing? What did he come up with to lessen the debt?  What was his involvement in the stockmarket?  Just curious. .

Being enviornmentally clean is rarely the cheap option.. That doesn't explain the stark split between Dems and the GOP on this, though. Both of them are pro-business.

Trudeau says a lot of things. *sigh*  I never liked him, and I knew he'd be mediocre at best. I voted for him, because I absolutely cannot stand Harper.  The choices were, Bad, and, Horrible.. Yeah, we had the same thing here. Nobody on the left will admit it though. Lots of people on the left admit that Clinton was a bad candidate.  . Well thats just cuz everyone knows she's terrible. Right, left, that's a bipartisan issue lol . I'd still take her over Trump any day of the week and twice on Sunday!. I wouldn't taken her at all. Now, I would've taken Bernie over both, even though I am not a socialist. But we know how the DNC screwed that one up. . So you prefer Trump? Cause the guy you replied to said he preferred Hillary over Trump.

It's literally a two second procedure that you won't even remember and your dick is cleaner and better looking for *life*.. Yeah, I mean I've got a bit of an ugly nose and one of my ears is lopsided too. Real mad my parents didn't step in and get them lopped off before I could remember it. Form over function and all that.. Why do you think you would look better with one ear and no nose? Circumcised penis's look better. This isn't a valid analogy. . >Circumcised penis's look better  This is called an opinion, my opinion is that uncut penises look better. Generally removing parts of the body is something you want based on medical fact, not opinions on what 'looks better'.. My main mistake was making a pro-circumcision post during EU waking hours, I need to get to bed. . Europeans aren't mad about this issue because it isn't a thing here. A lot of your fellow Americans are mad because their parents mutilated them without their consent. Plastic surgery on a baby would be fucked up too right? But it will look prettier! . The only people complaining are just people who are stuck with ugly dicks and want us all to have the same, sorry dude. No one is upset to have a nice looking, clean penis. .

A few more girls get into Oxford and you lose your shit.  Give me a break.. You haven't said anything to counter their point. And the poster is right - feminism isn't fit to reach equality for all people - it only deals with areas where one sex is doing worse compared to the other.. Their point is a statement most feminists would disagree with. The point of feminism is for women to reach equality. Do you know what equality means?. Yes, but it appears that feminism is for equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.  The former requires tyranny - the latter only fairness.

It may come to you as a surprise, but many reasons for patriarchy being a thing in ancient civilizations is... men are biologically stronger and more expendable. You only need one man per few women to have a viable population, so you can just keep sending men to hunt or wage wars as women sit at homes.  Those damn patriarchies where men were more likely to die young.... Almost like patriarchal systems negatively affect men as well.   If only a group existed that were trying to replace them with something better. . Yeah, with female supremacy. No thanks..

t3_7sxvl3	0	*	Oxford admits more British women than men for first time in its more than 1,000-year history.. Yay affirmative action.. What percentage of Oxford admissions should be female in your expert view?. Whatever percent pass the entrance exam, and have the required entrance credentials.  Gender, race, age, etc. shouldnt be used to determine who gets into school.  You either believe in judging people by superficial criteria, and giving/taking away privilege according to those criteria, or you dont.  . This is literally the first time in all of Oxford that more women than men got in. Where were you all those other years crying about how women were being discriminated against?. Do you know for a fact women were being discriminated against, or are you inferring that from past admissions numbers?  Equality of opportunity isnt the same as equality of outcome, and correlation doesnt prove causation.    . Sorry, weren't you just saying that the only reason more women got in this year was through discrimination against men? Because it certainly sounded that way.  Anyway, yes, I am thoroughly convinced that Oxford discriminated against women for over 800 years, because women were only permitted to matriculate there in 1920.. I think the story indicates that women were given preference, by virtue of the fact that fewer women than men applied, yet more women than men were accepted.    We would need the numbers to be certain, but they werent reported   . Women in the UK get better grades in primary, secondary, and sixth form education. Maybe the male candidates were just worse. :)

They've been here from the start.  Obviously not everyone wants them, but the people who do are really vocal about it.. How far back does this go?. At least the mid 1800's.  I don't know how much farther it goes I'm not a historian.  It had a large resurgence when the Taliban seized power.  It's a pretty widespread practice in central Asia too.

So all of those billionaires who just made millions in tax cuts alone can rejoice while the lower/middle class enjoys a $70/year tax cut.. To be fair, I'm getting an extra $2k in my paycheck this year because of the taxes. So it's not $70 for everyone. That $2k is massive for my current situation.  Not saying you're wrong with the rest of it, just saying many middle class workers were very much benefited.. > I'm getting an extra $2k in my paycheck  how. For the year, I mean. My federal tax liability dropped ~$60 per paycheck without any change in withholdings. . okay that makes more sense.. Why did you think people are getting nothing? Poor families with kids get **double** the credit **per child** now. It's $2,000.  Maybe too much reading on reddit?   This is a big tax cut but because we can't say Trump helped people in any way, the truth stays hidden.   My advice is go straight to the source of information and ignore headlines and comments. .

t3_7yoe0b	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. They wealthy havent paid their fair shares in a long time... too many loopholes. Same goes for corporations. I used to have a customer who was extremely wealthy (multimillionaire) and around tax time he once mocked me for paying more in taxes than he did. Its fucking ridiculous I was paying 30% and he was paying something like 2%.. Nothing vaguer than a fair share. . How about we define fair share of taxes as the share of wealth owned?    Edit: Should have said share of income earned instead of wealth owned.  . Well who determines the value of that wealth? Are you going to tally up every painting every person owns?. Let them self declare, but the price list is public and anyone can buy the things for listed cost (plus say 20% for the inconvenience).  *Oh, your Bugatti Veyron is only worth $2000? Cool, I'll buy it!*. >buy the things for listed cost  This is even worse and doesn't make any sense.   'Oh, your iPhone is worth $700, you have to give it to me now because I want to pay for it. Oh, you say it is worth more than that to you? $700,000 you say? Well I can't afford that, but now you have to pay taxes on that.'. It's a thought in progress. It would be better if the person offering to buy had to front up the cash first. The owner can then decide to pay more tax or sell.  I'd sell my phone for $700k  There would need to be some way to handle sentimental value I suppose. quite the vapid thought in progress. 
t3_7yoe0b	0	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. I'm not wealthy by any means but this always makes me feel conflicted because you pretty much punishing people for being too successful.   It's like you worked hard and made yourself rich now pay for it. I understand taxes are necessary but the answer always seems to be 'tax the rich more'.. Tax rates are progressive.  You don't ever lose money by making more money.    There's no punishment involved.  . Maybe punishment was a poor word choice. Does it not feel unfair to tax rich  people substantially more? They have  more money yes but they earned it.. They earned it but often through the investments that the country has made: they own companies that have workers who were educated in public schools and use infrastructure to get to/from work.   Nobody earns it on their own - they may put in incredible hard work and ambition that the market should recognize and reward, but we also have to recognize all the infrastructure it took to get there.  . So because most people are educated by public schools weathly people have to pay more taxes? That's silly wtf. The people who benefit the most from public infrastructure should also be the ones to invest more in it. . Poor people benefit more from it than a rich person does.. Not in absolute dollar amounts

Why not make it 0% then?. Then the government has no money and we have no police, military, public schooling, etc.. But what about before 1917? . The government before 1917 was a very different beast from what it is now, significantly more libertarian. Imagine not having social security or medicaid anymore, or having one of the smaller armies ad navies in the world.. *Heavy panting.  Go on....

t3_7yoe0b	0	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. How about we fix the things that allow Billionaires to get dramatically more benefits then.    Personally, I think that 20% tax is good enough for absolutely EVERYBODY.   If you think a government is necessary for our society and as long as there's no exemptions... 20% is enough for our societies to survive... twice a tithe.. Try telling that to the 47% of Americans who pay absolutley ZERO federal income tax.  Democrats will never agree to the flat tax rate of 20% because that would mean a huge chunk of their base would actually have to start contributing.   I like the idea. But it won't work with our current 2 party system when we have 80% of the people paying no taxes currently voting for one party.. > Try telling that to the 47% of Americans who pay absolutley ZERO federal income tax.  Like the homeless and dying.. If 47% of the country is homeless and dying then we should all just move to North Korea.  You first.. I'm just asking if the homeless and dying should be forced to pay income taxes, since you seem to have a problem with anyone paying (as you put it) ZERO federal income tax.. I really am not sure what you're getting at. I don't think you understand how a flat rate would work. Let me explain.  People who are homeless and dying wouldn't be forced to pay income taxes. They would be uneffected. They aren't working.  A flat tax of 20% of the $0 annual income that they is still zero. Make sense?. Ok so weve established a base were it is expected that some percentage of people would be expected to pay 0 taxes right. So what about $1, $2, etc. what is you base minimum before they should pay?  Because a lot of relatively smart people have come together and decided, and called it the poverty rate. You seem to disagree with their current assessment. So what is youre minimum?. I don't know how I can explain myself any clearer. There is no base minimum. It's a FLAT tax.  If they make $1 in 2018 then they are going to pay $0.20 in federal tax. If they make $10, they pay $2. If they make $10 billion, they pay $2 billion.  Can you try to articulate to me what isn't registering for you?

That's right, and also beside the point he's making. He most certainly did not suggest billionaires should donate more of their money to the treasury, which is what you're suggesting. You're talking about different things.. No, he thinks he should be taxed more, and Im saying he doesnt have to be because he can simply write checks for the amount he thinks he should have to pay.  You know, instead of raising taxes on everyone else.. > he thinks he should be taxed more  Right. Implying *anyone in his situation would be taxed more*. It's not specific to him. He's not saying the IRS should have more of his money. He's suggesting a policy change for everyone.  > You know, instead of raising taxes on everyone else.  But that's his suggestion. That's what he wants. You're talking about something else.. And I'm saying what he wants is stupid.  If he thinks he isn't taxed enough, he can just pay more and quit speaking for everyone else.. > If he thinks he isn't taxed enough, he can just pay more and quit speaking for everyone else.  You're almost there. He thinks *billionaires*, of which he is one, aren't taxed enough.. What part of he doesn't speak for everyone else are you missing here?.

Jose Andres the celebrity chef is credited with feeding more people hot meals there since the hurricane than Red Cross, any government or org.  https://www.worldcentralkitchen.org  Edit - hot meals. Could see an argument here for why private entities are better than government relief.. The government fails because it subcontracted to private entities, so no?. I'm saying you don't need the government as a middle man for recovery relief, when private companies and individuals can do it just fine, or in this case, better.. Why? You think it was the Government reaping all the rewards of this failed program?. Honestly, probably. If the government failed to deliver on what it promised, and we are missing 25,550,000 meals, then there is someone who benefited from A LOT of money. In other words, the inefficiencies of government (in this case) allowed them to take all the taxpayer money for 30million meals, and spend it on only 50,000 meals. Where do you think that other money went to?. To the private contractors hired to do the job.

It's a cost cutting measure for a small school district that couldn't afford the extra cost. . Cheaper to put no meat wouldnt it? . Veggies are fucking expensive honestly.. Only in the US because meat factory farms use subsidized corn for feed. Veggies are cheaper in France, as it should be. . cheaper per calorie/nutrient?  Because meat is fairly dense in both (and absolutely low in sugar). Meat requires much more water, time and money, per ton than basic vegetables. Not to mention the huge environmental impact of all the methane output . Imagine if people rationed their meat consumption properly? . Regardless, this move in France is nothing but a hit at Muslim and Jewish students, who actually paid for those meal plans. If it were a financial decision, they'd make it a vegetarian meal for that day.

And it's not much better for the environment. Methane is the issue.. Why should he care what age they die?. Because part of his argument was that it's better for the animal. Killing a healthy animal is not better.  And to reiterate, grassfed beef is actually quite a bit worse for the environment - the carbon sequestration argument doesn't take into account methane, which is dozens of times more potent than CO2 at trapping sunlight.. Having it live a happier life before slaughter is definitely better for it.. So if better is preferred, how about we don't kill it all (and/or not raise them in the first place)?. It was raised to be eaten. It literally exists because we decided it will exist, so we can then enjoy it.

Along with dismissal and resignation of hundreds of priests for involvement in abuse or cover up. And closer scrutiny in ordination and general employees.. Firstly the settlement sizes is not relevant to anything and secondly you are being dishonest in suggesting that any clergy have been dismissed for covering things up.

Not really. The strike will come from some random place in the ocean making it impossible to tell if its russian. Later on, days after the hit they may figure it out.. Doesn't matter. If we fired back it's good bye life on Earth.. Not all life.. Everyone forgets that the basis of the Matrix is a post nuclear war apocalypse. . IIRC, it's a bit different. The humans intentionally polluted the atmosphere to block the sun and starve the machines.. Like seriously. The Matrix had to happen in a universe where nuclear power didn't exist. Otherwise why the fuck would the machines grow humans for power, that is incredibly inefficient. It makes me wish that the studios didn't make them change it from using humans as processing power, would've simplified the ending too, as every person woken would kill the machine using their mind as a cpu.. Wasn't the reason that angle was dropped is because studio execs thought the general audience was too dumb to understand the concept of cloud computing?
t3_7ryufu	1	*	Pentagon Document Confirms Existence of Russian Doomsday Torpedo. Assuming this weapon actually exist, do we have the means to see when it's launched so we can retaliate on time?. Yes. If the delivery system exists, it exists not to be used in islation but part of a wider offensive either as a first or retaliatory strike. The US still has a guaranteed retaliatory strike capability and this weapon doesnt change that.. I mean we constantly hear about the air defense systems, but not much about the water defense systems.   Honestly it would be much easier for Russia to just line up a 10 of these autonomous underwater nuclear delivery systems 100 miles off the west coast and just let em fly.  We would never have the speed to intercept all of them or even the reliable ability to track them.... Russia could do that anway with existing technology. They just have to be closer to the target. And then what? It would do damage but it wouldnt prevent retaliation.. Let's say that out of the blue, there's a nuclear explosion in NYC. Wipes out the whole city, Statue of Liberty collapses half into the sand yadda yadda.  How do you know who to retaliate against? Unlike ICBMs, where you can detect the launch and track the flightpath to the target, with this seaborne weapon, there's no trail back.. Then we would know who did it as only one country has this capability.. There's multiple countries with ICBMs and SLBMs.. So why is it news if everyone had these already? Its so hard trying to figure these articles out based solely on context from the comments.

Seriously, this is the dude who spent eight years telling us Obama couldn't be American because he's black.  The same guy who calls Nazis very fine people, but black people kneeling are sons of bitches.  The dude who thinks all Mexicans are drug dealing rapists.. Not because he's black but because he's born in Kenya.  It's a baseless crackpot conspiracy theory, and there's no need to make up anything.  . And why did they think he was born in Kenya?. His dad was Kenyan and his dad's family is from Kenya. If you were going to make up a foreign country for him to have secretly been born in it's the most likely candidate.. His mom was born in America so it wouldn't even matter. It's all dog whistle bullshit. Everyone knows it was only an issue because of the colour of his skin. . >It's all dog whistle bullshit.  i see some people have found a new word to latch onto  i wonder how long it will take for reddit to run it into the ground

I am not a birther by any means so Im merely relaying information here, not trying to make a statement or anything.   The reason there was a conspiracy surrounding Obama was that our constitution says that you cant be president if you werent born here.

t3_7w9euo	0	*	Alleged ISIS operative 'Jihadi Jack' begs Canada to let him come here. Give him to the Iraqis.. Iraqi-Canadian here.  Even if he somehow manages to get back into Canada, I'll find him :D. You're going to join him, aren't you? *I knew it*. I won't put into detail what I would do to him or what thousands of other Iraqi expats might do if we find people like that, since that would constitute a crime, but I assure you he won't be as safe as he thinks in Canada.. Just what we need, more people running around ready to act out violently. You're a shining example of where our immigration policy has gotten us.. I guess you are against hunting Nazis after WW2 too? . I'm gonna get downvoted to hell.  But yes. I'm against hunting them down *now*.   If someone is in their mid 90's, lives a decent life and is generally apologetic for what they participated in, I'm okay letting them die at home vs in a cell.   Now if this were 1950, and those wounds were fresh, absolutely hunt them down. And the violence is going to come either way if you allow ISIS members into the country. The nazi's didn't stop being hunted after their war was over, neither will ISIS.    Listen, it's simple, these guys have a crosshair on them, if you don't want vengeful acts taken against ISIS members in Canada, don't let ISIS members into Canada. 
t3_808c7s	1	*	Russian oligarch bankrolls lawsuit against Olympic doping whistleblower. I get he's in US custody, but how does the US have jurisdiction for this civil case?. The guy is in US witness protection.  The Russians are trying to pull him out of witness protection with this lawsuit. Basically, it's a nuisance suit designed to harass the guy and unmask him. I'm not sure what the end game is. Maybe killing him? keeping him from testifying about more doping? . End game is to make him a warning for everyone thinking about fucking over Russia.  They're a mafia organization that thrives on fear and intimidation. It's all they really have.. Are you talking about the US or Russia?. Most Americans have no clue why most of the world hates us.  Terrorists exist because the US government does the same shit as other governments.  Its all fucked up, but I guess since America wont assassinate its own we think we are above everyone.  The US will just ruin other countries.  . Yeah we just have people who say,  write a couple articles exposing politician corruption and then they just happen to shoot themselves in the back of the head, twice... Or disappear mysteriously. But nothing to see here guys... look over there. I clearly said we dont have that.  I understand we dont do that to our own politicians and such.  The US has been fabricating wars since the 1800s, so Im not sure why people have a hard time believing why a lot of countries hate the US.. I don't see how you think we don't have that.. when we know we do

Yo I never said NK. I observed that the olympics is a popular place to defect in general. . lmao so instead of simply admitting you got called out for bullshitting or just letting it go, your response is oh but I didn't mean NK specifically, even though this thread is about NK/SK and the context is about NK/SK!   You do know you just blatantly admitted to everyone that your reading comprehension is rubbish and that you're an idiot, right? . Looks like you're the one trying to twist words here. He made a general statement that defections happen at the Olympics. That's true. No need to get upset kid.. So your defence is that he made an arguement completely out of the discussion that could be taken contextually so its not his fault?  You do know whats worse right?   >No need to get upset kid.  nvm looks like you were trying to troll...and poorly. *defense

Russia you need a new hobby. Instead of bringing other countries down to make your reputation look better, is looking real old. Like cold war old. Just stop . The cold war never ended, i think the last couple of years made this pretty clear?. The cold war was pretty dead from 1992 until Putin in 2000, from there it just got worse and worse.. Wich is why i cant believe people elected obama who said hey romney. The 80s called and they want there foreign policy back when romney daid he would have a tough stance on russia. Considering the wars in the middleeast the past 20 years and the US involvement, I dont think Obama was wrong either. It was just a political cheapshot. . I mean how was he not wrong?  He literally ran a campaign AGAINST aggressive russian stances  And was caught on tape telling the Russian ambassador hed have more flexibility after the election wich essentially means that any agressions he did display was all an act to get elected   . But he ended up being strong against them unlike the current US president. . What? No he wasn't. Have you forgotten the whole Crimea fiasco?

Russia you need a new hobby. Instead of bringing other countries down to make your reputation look better, is looking real old. Like cold war old. Just stop . It really looks silly, the amount of effort the Russian govt puts into something as boring and meaningless as olympics propaganda. . It's not silly at all. Putins approval rating was tanking before sochi, after it skyrocketed. He used this new found political capital to invade Ukraine. The Olympics has very real geopolitical implications.. Someone has seen Icarus? . Listened to the JRE with the film maker but I haven't seen the film, no netflix account.. ah. Its worth a watch if you ever get the chance. Pretty eye opening, makes you wonder if all the Russians are juicing how does the rest of the world still compete? . A good example would be at the beginning of the film when the guy was still trying to be a cyclist. He placed higher in the race without doping than the next year with doping oddly enough. Some people are just natural freaks with world class training.. Ironically the mutations that make them natural freaks are often just the body producing its own excess steroids or blood cells. Maybe doping in the future will involve gene editing.
t3_80uyhx	0	*	Norway announces plans to ban semi-automatic guns, 10 years after Anders Brevik attack. Thank god I live in America. I love my rights.. The right to be constantly worry sick about your kids in high school is my favourite. Its hilarious that you actually believe taking away guns will change that. The truth is you have no idea how to stop it so you just come up with an excuse of how to stop it to make yourself feel better.. Its hilarious that you actually believe taking away guns will not change that. And is not EU global know by guns problems. Or are you saying that America don't have a problem? . I'm not saying America doesn't have a problem. I'm saying only taking guns away from law abiding citizens won't change anything. America has a huge drug problem. Last I checked, drugs are illegal.. I understand your point however all people are law abiding citizens until someone buy a ar-15 legally and kill alot of people. Sorry but no one need a war gun to defend himself. . I'm not going to debate with someone who is not familiar with the second amendment. If you actually understood the second amendment you would know that yes, you do need a war weapon to defend yourself.. Hiding behind some law just to not argument some point is stupid. In democracy the people have the power to change the law that is why slavery is now illegal. Is like saying i kill people and you don't understand why because you don't know my religion book. 
t3_7xy2f6	0	*	Tillerson meets with Turkish leader without translator in break from protocol: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Turkey's leaders for more than three and a half hours without American policy aides or a translator in attendance.. this is just stupid of him to let someone from a foreign government do the translation. he has no idea how it words could have been twisted.. But now he can always say That's not what I said.  Gets him out of any agreement the Turks think he made.. And then the Turks will play the recording they made to show the world that he's lying.  . Then we get to regime change them. . I hope like hell not. Turkey has its problems, but It needs to be changed by Turkish people from within, or it won't last. It can't be changed by the outside world, that will just ensure that no one ever trusts the outside world again (it's already tenuous enough). . Who said it has to be a Turkish government? Restoring Greek ownership of Anatolia would be even better.. Anybody that identified as Greek left anatolia almost 100 years ago in the population exchange after the Turkish war of independence. Except for a few communities in Istanbul, there are pretty much no Greeks in anatolia today, and the ones that are there all came from modern Greece either for business/vacation.. Poland is sitting on land that was German for hundreds of years. People can move.
t3_7qshim	0	*	22 million Yemenis now in need of aid: UN. Why are the Yemen government unable to help their own people?  Why are their politicians living the good life?. Because it's a dictatorship supported by Saudi Arabia and US. It is time for revolution and replace their government.  . yemen is precisely in the middle of a huge civil war (following a semi failed revolution) that is hampering all efforts there  the country is messily fragmented between the houthis rebels, hadi gov and various jihadis groups trying to cut their part of the pie (aq, isis, ...). Sounds like an absolute shit storm.  . it is  more info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present). Sometimes it might be a better solution to split the nation because the different groups are too polarizing.  Like Yugoslavia.  There is no common ground for compromise.  So therefore democracy cant even work.  . it's not a split. The country exploded between factions that want all the power and they kill each other on a daily basis to move the front line with background jihadis taking over part of it and trying to kill everyone. Think afghanistan or congo.

Flynn was a pretty danged appropriate head.  In any normal administration, the National Security Advisor being compromised would be the scandal of the decade. It would be a Tom Clancy movie starring Harrison Ford.. Right. In any sort of Democracy these fuckers would have been out already. But, we live in a fascist state and the poor are not organized enough to rise up.. > we live in a fascist state  LOL.  Thats just so weak-minded.. I'm not sure what is weak-minded about it. The rich and/or corporations control our government. That's called fascism. Look it up.  edit: I have been corrected. That is not fascism. I appreciate those that have corrected me. Thank you.. That is most definitely not facism.  I believe you are referring to corporate oligarchy or corporatocracy.

The retailer said it would be replacing plastic with packaging including paper and pulp trays and paper bags.. For clarity, Iceland is a UK supermarket chain, not the country.. Thank you.  I was very confused.. And furthermore a very low end supermarket. It's pretty much frozen chicken drumsticks and beer. the owner was on TV a while back specifically stating that he's not there to save the world but to feed the poor so this is a pleasant shift. Feeds the poor, sells beer and takes care of the environment?  Quick britons. Get rid of your useless royal family and gives this guy a crown.. The queen isn't useless, even if her ancestors may have been. She used to work as a car mechanic or something like that during WWII. By now she should have retired already, so she's allowed to not do much.. Im sure the millions of pensioned britons living on a fraction of her income agree.. The queen doesn't have an income, they are just rich as fuck and *earn* capital gains (ignoring any discussion on whether they deserve to keep the money from the previous, more active monarchs).  They make/pay the England money.  They're a net positive for the country.. Thats not how the monarchy works...

Apparently it's not very tasty. People buy it because:  a) it's expensive  b) it's rarely served (not many chefs study how to do it and would risk serving it)  c) it's somewhat of a risk.  And yeah, apparently it has a slight numbing sensation which people think is because of toxin. But no, that's just a shitty fish.. No. You havent had a proper one then. It is not a shitty fish and youll know if you eat a good one.   Sauce: japanese. If you're going to tell them no, then properly explain why instead of just telling them they didn't have a good one. Is it delicious to you? . Explain why? Its delicious to me. And with a quick google search preferably in Japanese will prove that the comment I replied to is a very unpopular opinion among the Japanese. . I think the whole shark fin soup thing has people assuming that every dish only bought rarely by mostly rich people must actually taste bland.. Goose liver? Fish eggs? Where's the goose? Where's the fish?  That's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of animals.. Served with a bowl of grease slathered on rusty nails

I'd expect him to be killed however, I don't really see why they'd bother keeping them alive.. Because he's a bargaining chip, because Turkey really doesn't want them to piss off Russia for no reason, and because they like staying alive. The Turkmen in Latakia killed a pilot. There are no longer Turkmen in Latakia. . >Because he's a bargaining chip  A lot of countries have a flat out don't negotiate with terrorists rule  >Because Turkey really doesn't want to piss of Russia  Who says Turkey even has a say in this? It was shot down by FSA rebels, not Turkey.. Turkey is the sponsor and guarantor of those rebels. There are Turkish observers in various places in the province. If Turkey closes the border, they're fucked. If Turkey backs down and agrees to the SAA taking the whole province, they're fucked. . Just because Turkey backs the rebels doesn't mean that they can magically stop a group of them from shooting down a Russian jet and executing the pilot. They aren't magicians.    Fuck, Osama Bin Laden was trained by UK and US forces. Just because groups are backed by them doesn't mean other countries can control what they do.

Pakistan is the worst country currently, in my opinion.. Like everywhere else, Pakistan can surprise you. Urban centres like Lahore are home to a rising tide of liberal, educated young people. They look on the northern and rural areas of the country like we do.  Its kind of how New Yorkers look at deep red rural enclaves and their gay bashing mega churches.. I'm well aware of the urban centers. I dated a girl from Islamabad, learned Urdu, studied Islam. Still backwards.. I don't disagree it's backwards, but it's seems less backwards than Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Afghanistan. . Seems that way but Pakistan projects their ignorance onto the rest of the world and ME and SA. The Saudis and Iran are fighting for more influence for their fundamentalist ideology. I doubt Pakistan projects their values on the scale of those two powers.

I wonder if it's more or less of an environmental disaster than physically mining gold. . Gold is at least a tangible, useful, reusable material. Crypto currency is really just arbitrary value assigned to an idea.. And if gold ever drops in price, it'll still be very useful for electronics and nanotechnology, so we'll still be glad that we mined all that gold. It's a great material that's currently being held back by the fact that it's so expensive.. Silver is a better conductor of electricity than copper, which is also better than gold.  If you are going to invest in metal with the expectation that someday you will have to use it as anything other than currency, silver is the way to go. . The big draw for gold in electronics is that it's non-reactive and doesn't corrode.  . True. But the amount used in electronics is so small, the need for gold would be minimal.     . The amount used in electronics is so small because each gram costs $42, whereas a gram of copper costs $0.007. If the price of gold was lower, it would make sense to use more of it.

But you want your fantasy to be reality *so badly* that you're willing to abandon actual rational though and critical thinking.. How is he not?  The President cant enter the National Assembly building without invitation so government ministers are the only ones who can report the governments policies to Parliament.

Are these drugs paid for by the government as part of the healthcare system or sold directly to consumers? . Does it really matter if the fleecing happens directly or indirectly?. Yes?. The burden gets passed down to the consumers one way or another. . Be that as it may, there is *significant* difference in exploiting a market inefficiency and exploiting a market inefficiency while making sure no individuals are hurt, only institutions.. Either a few sick individuals get extorted directly, or the government eats the cost and raises taxes to cover the expense, costing everyone more money in the process.  Yeah, neither are acceptable rewards for flagrant corporate greed.. Difference is that it's actually pretty difficult to fleece a large institution for long. At some point an actuary starts asking questions and if they don't like the answers they get you might find yourself no longer doing business with said institution (or worse, facing a lawsuit). It's why a drug like Insulin or an EpiPen tend to cost less in Single Payer countries.

You need a prison, guardians, food, etc. Iraq is not a rich nation. I'd recon those ressources could be better spent on the citizens rather than extracting revenge on an individual.. In the US it costs nearly double to execute someone rather than have them in prison for life.. That's only because of some laws.  Killing someone would realisticly always be cheaper than keeping them alive. Unless you want to kill them by dropping a 1000kg block of gold on them.. I'm pretty sure you could reuse the block, recouping most of the costs.. You'd recoup the costs after 33.3 executions if it's in the US (Average cost of a death penalty trial is $1.26 million, the price of 1000kg of 24 carat gold is $42 million.)

Wrong. It's nothing to do with being embarrassed but demonstrating that the law also applies to the powerful or those with powerful friends. We can't have people evading justice by holing up in embassies until the authorities grow bored. Justice is supposed to be patient.. Yeah except its not about that, everyone in the world knows if you got enough cash, even in the UK, you're gonna be ok.  If you do upset particular people then you will be focused on..

You keep using that word jihadi. I do not think it means what you think it means.  Anyway, attacking medical facilities is never OK.

I'm not sure how far down into the earth the missile would penetrate, though. . I think you're confused or *really* simplifying how a nuclear weapon works. Nuclear weapons work by using a conventional explosion (like TNT) to jumpstart a fission explosion, which is then itself used to jumpstart a fusion explosion.

You know he cant just close the borders or keep Americans from leaving? No one has that power iirc. When has not being able to do something ever stopped trump from doing it anyway? . Im think he meant that you literally cant stop Americans from leaving. Its practically impossible. The country is too big. Well on behalf of the rest of the world we'd give it our best shot. You're a bunch of fucking mugs and we're sick to the back fucking teeth of you lot.. Are you talking to me?

Honestly, I'd recommend the rest of the world do its best to completely ignore and shun the shitshow America's become until Comrade Twitler is out of office.  Most Americans are aware that America First is hate-speech no different than white power! And by 'Americans' I mean living, breathing humans. Not the troll armies you'll find in online discussions or articles.. In what way has America become a shitshow? Because liberals aren't getting their way for the first time in 60 years?. We literally aren't first in anything but shootings U0001f602. Which country has a higher gdp than the US? Which country submits more medical research than the US?

Please let me know because last I read we were leaps and bounds ahead in multiple categories. . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita  I'm too lazy to debunk your other claims, but as soon as you look them up per capita, you will find out.  You are #1 in imprisoned people, afaik 20 or 25% of the world prison population, sits in American prisons.. Reread my comment, I didn't say per capita. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal). Not adjusted for per capita makes no sense, because the US has a bigger pop than most countries. But ok, believe your absolute nonsenes.. And adjusting for per capita makes no sense because that does very little to sway international trade. Kinda thought people browsing worldnews would generally look at the big picture but ok.

You mean you don't want schools to turn into a war zone during school shootings?! B-b-but then when will I ever be able to use muh ar-15?  /s. Dont you see that arming people who never wanted to be armed and by and large arent comfortable with the idea will deter all future school shootings?. I didn't realize the proposal was forcing every teacher to be armed, as opposed to being an option.   Oh what? Nobody would be **forced** to carry? Wild. . So then almost no one would? Genius! School shootings solved!. If even 5% start carrying these shooters will target the next easiest gun free zone. Remember these people are cowards who want easy kills for the infamy. If it's truly a mental health issue and has nothing to do with guns, won't they just blow up school buses or something?. I never said it was a mental health issue. Blowing up school buses is doable but it wouldn't produce the same fame which is kind of a big reason for doing it.

The wall can definitely be built.

I'm definitely a progressive, but if Democrats had went through with this, I would've sat out the next election. . Yeah, don't vote, that'll show them!. Honestly, it might. I disagree with the idea that people should just show up and vote, regardless of what the candidate supports. I have a very simple rule in that I don't for anyone who doesn't support the majority of my interests, I don't care what side of the aisle you're on. . That's why I voted third party, err technically it was more like 4th or 5th party. And it's acronym was LMN party so I had to fight the urge to snicker when I thought of a certain shock website. But I was able to sleep knowing I voted for someone I actually wanted to be president instead of the lesser of evils.. If there was a third party candidate that I believed in, I would've done the same. But last election felt like a parade of morons. Probably the worst 3rd party candidates I've ever seen.

t3_801f4d	0	*	Mexico's president called off a White House visit after Trump refused to say publicly that Mexico won't pay for the border wall. Mexico is going to pay for it is literally a slogan. Any President can manipulate taxes in a way to technically count as Mexico paying for the wall even though that money could be used on better things. . The US cannot tax Mexican citizens. One way or another, the money would have to come from the US. . The US can tax Mexican imports. Thats not confiscating currency, but its certainly taking dollars that would otherwise go to Mexico and giving it to the Federal government.   You could make the same argument that companies do not pay taxes, people do, but that would ignore the effects taxes have on both volume and profit margin. . No. If you put tariffs to Mexican products, the incidence of the tariff will be shared between the Mexican producers and the American consumers. Some Mexican producers may stop finding it profitable to export their products to the US and either close down or find alternative clients for their products.  Its still not Mexicans paying for the wall.. I dont think thats a meaningful distinction. Trump has never claimed the wall would be paid by the Mexican government specifically. His message has always been anti-NAFTA and singles out trade imbalances for their role in the decline in US manufacturing.. Let me rephrase it. You, as an American consumer, are also paying for it through higher prices. So at best Mexico pays a part of it through forgone income and American people pay it through higher prices.  Genius move.. Hey Im a free trade guy and dont want to see it happen. Its just dumb not to awknowledge that he can force Mexico to pay for the wall. . Its just dumb thinking that money that Mexico stops receiving from doing business with the US and that it can start getting from elsewhere constitutes him making Mexico pay.  Specially because the money will still come from American pockets in two ways: taxes levied to the American public and higher prices paid by American consumers.

Plenty could be private citizens who want to, and lots more could be former military or police.

Theres plenty of wall down there anyways. Ive seen teenagers scale them with pallet ladders like its nothing lol. Nevermind that most illegal immigrants just overstay visas instead of climbing a fucking fence.  Yea but the point of a wall is to keep out the illegal immigrants who can't get in with a  travel visa. Like wanted criminals and gang members.   There's a reason people risk their lives and spend thousands of dollars to cross the border on foot instead of just driving through a checkpoint or hopping on a plane. . Gonna need any reliable source that the bulk of those crossing outside if checkpoints are wanted criminals or gang members.. He didn't say the bulk crossing outside of checkpoints are wanted criminals or gang members. He said those who cross illegally are those who can't come through a checkpoint then gave one example of a group that fits that.

And we'd want to do THAT because the nation is struggling with obesity. BOOM trillions saved in healthcare costs.  5-D chess, people!  (Have to clarify I'm kidding because undoubtedly this argument has been made by red-hats.). There are many good arguments against a wall but your food will cost more because there is no longer slave labor to harvest it is a very bad one . I don't know. If Alabama was any indication, farmers would rather have their harvest rot in the fields than pay for non-immigrant labor to pick it. Immigrants are fast, they don't complain and they are cheap. Americans are slow, expect to be treated with some respect and are expensive. . We call this a race to the bottom and it's toxic for everyone involved.

Nope, we need more attendance from the youth. The youth hardly even voted that we'd end up swinging whatever candidate for the youth vote. . Youth here. I'm using Trump as motivation to guilt my friends into voting in future elections.. And this is why the youth vote means nothing, if they can be peer pressured in to changing their views, then their views are worth nothing.   Guilt is a great way to politically motivate people, everyone loves having friends that guilt them in to making choices.   But I guess in reality you have very few friends, and the friends you do have likely have left idealistic views.   . Guilt is probably poor word choice on my part. These are people that are eligible to vote that disagreed with Trump's views from the beginning that did not vote in the election for whatever reason.. I agree, it's so frustrating to hear about people who didn't like the outcome of an election but didn't bother voting. I get that sometimes there's no candidates you really want to vote for, but I still think a lot of people that didn't vote were just lazy.

He even said it was to not kill them, but make them useless without their genitals. . Trump: grab 'em by the pussy!  World: oh, that's awful  Duterte: HMB  Duterte: shoot 'em in the pussy!. Trump: grab 'em by the pussy!  World: oh, that's awful  Duterte: HMB. Upvote for correct use of HMB. . Sorry but Im out of the loop- whats HMB?. Hold my beer.

t3_7yzrpo	0	*	Philippines' Duterte mocks condom use amid skyrocketing HIV rates because they don't feel good. This dude is fucking dumber than Trump. . that recent wired cover story on facebook included a sentence along the lines of in some countries like the phillipines, facebook effectively IS the internet. when i read that, a lot about what's happened in the Philippines over the last 2-3 years makes a lot more sense to me. I know a lot of Filipinos that like the fact that he is killing drug dealers and addicts. They think it will improve the country. I am not sure if facebook would change this attitude one way or the other.. Thats because you know nothing about living there or the culture. Youre judging this from the biased lens of America and the only news you hear is from reddit. Ethnocentrism. Loook it up. . Wrong. And wrong. Look through the replies I have gotten. You are in the minority. Do you live in the Philippines now kuya/ate? . Yes I have actually lived there and have family there.   Replies are from reddit who are mostly from America wtf do you expect?   . I have yet to meet a Filipino who does not support Duterte but my family are all from rural parts of the Philippines so it might be different in Manila and other areas. According to your post history you also speak Korean and hang out with Steve Nash so I give up.. No. You obv cant read and dont know sarcasm. Pls read into other peoples perspective instead of throwing, These people believe -. There are very thoughtful discussions on this. Maybe not at the top but its somewhere in every Duerte thread.   
t3_81cud6	1	*	Israeli Soldiers Assaulted Palestinian Reporters to Prevent News Coverage. After reading more articles than I can count about abuses by IDF I have to wonder how anyone respects them. Even considering the attacks between Palestine and Israel the IDF seem to lack basic human decency more often than not.. The IDF is made up mainly of kids who just want to live through their enlistment. Having reporters from any where reporting your movements and location live on TV is not increasing your chances of survival.. Increasing chance of survival??? 99% of Palestinians just trying to go to work, eat, shit and sleep. Theres a greater chance of death NOT being in the IDF. If 99% of Palestinians just want to work, eat, shit, and sleep, then it is surprising that 2/3 of them support the random stabbing of Israeli civilians.  www.timesofisrael.com/poll-23-of-palestinians-back-stabbing-attacks-armed-uprising/amp/. If 99% of Israelis just want to work, eat, shit and sleep why do 2/3 of them support the illegal occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? . The catch 22 is that the majority of Israelis neither want Palestinians to have their own state, nor do they want Palestinians to have voting rights in a shared state.. I don't know that racism is a Catch-22.  Not wanting the Palestinians to have their own state, and also not wanting them to have basic human rights aren't conflicting desires, since they can both be achieved under an apartheid regime.. The catch-22 is with not expecting a reaction in conjuction with those two beliefs, not between those two beliefs themselves.

Even considering the attacks between Palestine and Israel the IDF seem to lack basic human decency more often than not.. Really makes you wonder... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_Palestinian_militant_groups. Any attack by the Palestinians is being labeled as a terrorist attack. So should the attacks of the other side. Terrorism isn't just a word you slap onto things you don't like. The vast majority of attacks by  Palestinians are non-state actors intentionally directed against civilians for political gain. Individual soldiers of a state hyper-violently arresting civilians is at best police brutality, at worst, a war crime. . > Terrorism is the war of the poor and war is the terrorism of the rich. - Peter Ustinov. oooh spooky  like anyone even knows who that is. >  A respected intellectual and diplomat, he held various academic posts and served as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF and President of the World Federalist Movement.

Life is not a zero-sum game.. Vaping is definitely healthier than my job.. Is your job to smoke cigarettes?. There is a lot of jobs unhealthier than vaping. Many jobs in construction, carpenter, welding, mining. Also a lot of factories constantly have some sort of dust in the air.  But then sitting all day also fucks up your shit, as is with stress so yeah work fucking blows.. I work in construction. I just lost the tip of my thumb to a router bit. I also vape and have yet to injure myself. Construction is definitely more unhealthy than vaping. 20 years down the line, I'd be willing to bet money it wont be the end of your thumb that takes you to the hospital or potentially to addiction therapy. In 20 years I can guarantee that my job will be the reason I go to the hospital. I've smoked and vaped for over a decade without getting addicted.

No, Trump is just as if not more corrupt.  Collusion with the Russians to get dirt on a political opponent while simultaneously calling for their arrest lock her up.  Fuck them both so hard, they both should rot in jail. I'd love to see Trump and Hillary share the same cell. . And what is Hillary guilty of? . Being a strong woman and a dem. Weak men hate those.

t3_7vyrlo	1	*	Israeli police recommend indicting Netanyahu for corruption: report. Couldn't happen to a more deserving asshole.. Enter Trump.. . Enter Putin. Well he's just a straight up dictator.. There's no chance of him ever being indicted for corruption.  But yeah, he certainly deserves it. . Not necessarily a dictator, but definitely totalitarian. . A dictator is just a de facto ruler of a government. Given that there is no indication of the trustworthiness of the Russian elections and the fact that he just rotates into power, president or prime minister, every 4 years forever, I think it's safe to say he's a dictator. Even dictators have supporters they have to keep happy to stay in power; that doesn't mean they aren't despots.. See there are some nuances here that I think dont particularly make it safe to call him a dictator, let alone a despot. He is an autocrat and is a totalitarian. . That's fair. Autocrat is probably a more apt description.

To try and pretend otherwise is just American ignorance . >American ignorance  Oh god the irony of this statement.  The idea that Americans are just unilaterally more ignorant than anyone else, which in itself a spectacularly ignorant notion.. I mean... have you talked to the average American?. I'm sure the average person in your country is a PhD grad. Americans just put a car into space for fun. People from other countries can say what they want but they know who's on top.. It was a demo flight. The car was just for marketing. Guessing by your reaction, it worked

t3_7r1unt	0	*	'In Touch' Explosive Interview With Stormy Daniels: Donald Trump Cheated on Melania With Me. Explosive?   Trump is a famously philandering asshole whos got two ex-wives he very publicly cheated on, married to an Eastern European model whos 30 years his junior and who has never displayed much, if any, affection for him.   Who is this explosive to? The religious right? Who knew all of this and voted for him anyway? Cmon. . The religious right? Are we still putting that fig leaf on the white/male supremacists? . Many who vote for conservative causes in America, especially in the South, swing on just one single issue: [Abortion](http://news.gallup.com/poll/157886/abortion-threshold-issue-one-six-voters.aspx). IMO this is likely the driver of what can accurately be called the religious right. . Ive heard it said by religious conservatives that if you believe that a fetus is a living human with a soul, and that every abortion is the murder of a sinless child, what other issue CAN there be to vote on?. That's easy to answer: prioritize reducing suffering. We all know from first-hand experience that fetuses do not have a meaningful inner life, therefore do not 'suffer' the same way rational adults, even children, do. So logically, it would make sense to make the world better for the already-born, since they suffer far more.. Playing devils advocate.  #1. The value of a soul (which you may not believe in, but plenty do.) is not the intensity of its suffering or the richness of its inner-life. It is the endowed property given by God.  #2. Is killing a person with cerebral palsy who enjoys very little awareness less severe than killing a person with full awareness?. None of that is relevant to my point about right-to-lifers ignoring the suffering of the already-born in favor of obsessing over the alleged well-being of fetuses.. You and I probably agree on this, but right-to-lifers would probably say We dont IGNORE the other issues, but whether you are for-or-against legal abortion will always be the most important issue.

It was back when women and POC knew their place and weren't asking to be treated like equals. You know, when only white men were in positions of power everywhere.. They forget that at that time, it was the *rich* white men who had that power. Poor whites (i.e., non landowners) were considered garbage as well..

If you actually read the article you will find that this propaganda comes from unnamed sources and overtly anti-Trump reporters.  Here's a question for you- If Trump is so money hungry, then why is he the only President since JFK to decline to receive the $400,000 presidential salary?. Only poor or working people earn money as salary. Research rentier culture.. Or maybe research Uranium One to see how truly corrupt politicians made their money. Congratulations! You back someone who is just as corrupt as all the other people. Did you ever believe in draining the swamp, or was that just a slogan?. Corrupt??? How exactly is Trump corrupt?  Mueller has been allowed to operate an unprecedented witch hunt for the last year and he hasn't been able to prove anything except that Trump is clean.  I agree that the swamp need to be drained and that means both Republicans & Democrats who don't represent the best interests of the American people.   . How is this gift to Deutsche Bank in the best interest of the American people?. Good question.  I have to say that I haven't had a chance to do much research on this subject yet.  From the little I know, it is my understanding that this matter hasn't reached a final resolution yet, so I am withholding my judgment for now.. Sometimes I wonder if the people who want to be president all think we're too stupid to notice when they're clearly on the take.

The only fun in there to be had is when reality hits and they go all No True Scotsman.. That just makes it even scarier to me, to be honest. One of the major problems is that the right has created an atmosphere in which disagreeing with a single thing gets you ostracized and labeled as the enemy. No one on their side wants to be the enemy, they know how that side is treated, and they don't want to be outside of the club, so they don't dare speak up when something isn't right. . That's how cults work. You start agreeing with insane shit just to go along with the majority opinion.

I honestly don't think they peruse any media that would run this article . This is the answer. When I talk to Trump supporters they literally have never heard of any of the shit that's happened. All they know is Obama is the devil and trump is making America great again. So when you try to tell them all the things he's fucking up, they have never heard of it and assume it's just liberal media BS or there must be some good reason for it . > All they know is ~~Obama~~ Hillary is the devil  I work with several die hard republican trump supporters. They still bring up hillary on a daily basis. Like she is somehow secretly behind everything in the world. They full on believe that she was the one that colluded with russia. . I mean you're talking about people who believe that there is a shadow government called The Deep state that is somehow undermining everything that the Trump Administration has done and it is run by the Democrats.  It's a wholly Preposterous conspiracy but if that's what you truly believe in of course they're going to be upset about Hillary Clinton. Seems almost as crazy and trump colluding with Russia. But people believe that on 0 evidence.. lol, 0 evidence.  Ever notice how the position has changed from Trump's campaign to Trump himself?

Thanks for saying what I was too lazy to type. Even as an atheist I still see the benefits of religious studies from a geopolitical viewpoint . Agreed, but I don't see why they shouldn't just be part of a history class.  . Because while religions have their place in history, learning about them and their current standing in the world isn't a history topic.   I've been an atheist since I was a child, but even 15 years ago in secondary, I didn't mind religion class. Our teacher just taught us about other religions and it was interesting.. Their current standing in the world is directly influenced by history, and the fundamentals of the religions haven't changed all that much.  . But their impact on current civilization certainly has changed and warrants being taught and learned, and imo the more someone knows about the world outside of theirs the best. There's only a few decades that aren't taught in history class (yet), so you wouldn't be missing much.  . In history class, you learn about the impact a religion has had on the world. In religion class, you learn about the religion, the beliefs, and how it affects those regions.   I mean surely, you must understand that learning about Hannibal doesn't teach you the geography of the Alps.

I guess Columbus arrived to find no one in what became the states?. It was just colonies of Euro empires. But Canada in a way has remained a dominion of the British, even after 1867.

I literally said nothing about taxi drivers; but yes, taxi driving is a very regulated business . Every single uber experience I have had has been 10x better than a taxi. Most are professionals working jobs on the side. I think anyone who actually has used both will agree.   Taxis are regulated in that you have to buy medallions to use them.

Poor politics and wand waving though, We do more and have more influence, we dont like when you disagree with us. Keep it up and we will remember that when its your turn is not really in the spirit of the UN. It was a very well spoken 3rd grader argument that at no point mentioned something working toward a solution.. The way I saw it, it was part of a much bigger problem. It's saying dude, y'all have been screwing with our allies for so long, and we don't like giving you money when the only things you have actually done is condemn Israel.  I mean Israel has problems obviously, but really? This is what the UN spends everyday doing? https://www.unwatch.org/un-israel-key-statistics/. If you have to rationalize it so it's sounds less inflammatory, then that's probably not what was said/meant. Not really, I just feel people don't understand how anti-Israel the UN is until one person (Nikki) said that. I knew they hated Israel, but after the speech looked up actual statistics and it's actually ridiculous how anti-israel the whole UN is.. Hates probably a strong word. But I have been hearing that sentiment for years. I have no stake in that debate because I genuinely don't follow the UN enough. But I've heard that before.. I agree, hate is a strong word, but I believe I used it appropriately.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Israel#UN_member_states  34 members of the UN don't even recognize Israel as a country.

That wasn't the question. You are technically correct, which I will grudgingly admit is the best kind of correct.  My point was that the Supreme Court is somewhat less partisan than its makeup would seem. They're not beholden to those who appointed them, so you can't say the GOP holds the Supreme Court in the same way they hold Congress or the Presidency.. It is extremely partisan, the difference is that thankfully most Justices have brains that can comprehend issues beyond black and white left wing vs right wing rhetoric.

If it's found that they had something like a law prepared that's a specific reason and thus would be illegal. . I mean, specially interests have their lobbyists write entire bills all the time. They might have to be a bit more opaque than was presented, but not much.. Weren't there multiple instances recently of people forgetting to take the name of the lobbyist/firm off the draft that was submitted before congress?. That name being ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Does America not have any laws for conflict of interest as a government official or do they just not enforce any of them?. All 3 branches of gov is currently controlled by 1 party right now. One of the 1st things they tried to do last year was [eliminate the independent ethics office](https://apnews.com/a349ef57fb6b4b4f82809b3c7b0d4c68), that should indicate how much they're interested in investigating this kind of stuff.. Yup. And whenever something goes wrong, they still blame the other party.. In fairness both sides are massively guilty of legalized bribery. Yup. Both sides are guilty of some heinous shit, but one side is worse. Plenty worse, in fact.. Bribery is bribery, if you're going to argue one is worse you're accepting the other!. Not at all. Acknowledging the fact that one side is worse than the other doesn't justify the actions of the side that isn't worse.. That's true it's when you *choose* one over the other when both are wrong that their is implicit acceptance, just the existence doesn't make it true. Fair enough!
t3_7oza7e	0	*	Kushner Under Fire for Receiving $30M From Israeli Firm While Shaping Middle East Policy. Can anyone explain to me how this differs from the whole russia meltdown going on for over a year?. Because receiving money from foreigners is legal as long as there is no proven effect (whoever had that great idea). It just sounds like bribery but it's legal! Unlike the other part (alleged collusion) which is illegal.  Also it's not from Russia I guess so there's that?. but what have they been so flustered about with trump then? If receiving money is legal? I do not really get it.... Because there's a question as to whether this money shaped policy decisions, in which case it might well be less than legal.. as opposed to this 30 million, where there is no question it shaped policy decisions?  I am sorry but I promise I am not trying to be purposefully obtuse, I just do not understand.... I'm not sure what you're asking? (sorry). What I am asking is how is this collusion any different to other collusion... Are they sure this 30 million did not shape foreign policy or what?. Oh I see. It isn't really, but it doesn't directly involve Russia so I guess it doesn't suit the current narrative (not that it's any better).

Israel and Saudi Arabia and its allies.   . And also Russia.. how have they benefited? . America is giving them free reign to do whatever the fuck they want to without contest.. We recently increased arms to Ukraine. Trump increased the military budget, hes still sending Nato troops and money. What has Russia been allowed to do? Expose clinton and her teams own words and pay some trolls online?. Don't be an idiot.. good argument, seems like when I talk to people about the russia issue they get very upset and call me a russian shill or just resort to ad hominims  . It is all real friendo, dont be a idiot, in fact, I am a real russian agent on sabotaging elections operatives, send me Steam games or credit passwords for PM or Trump will continue winning elections, no joke, my trolling skills have absolute power above your nation USA, submit yourselves to my might.

Okay, so, the person you voted for vouches for, employs, defends, and supports someone who is no better than the person you didn't vote for. So Obama is just as culpable as Clinton, got it.. Sure.

You sell an addict fentanyl, he/she ODs because he/she is used to morphine or dilaudid , and you say the dealer shouldnt have any punishment? . If they are lying about their product that is something different, there is recourse for that with any product.    No more punishment then liquor store clerks gets.  Edit. No recourse means these dealers can feed and build their customers habit, reguardless of product. And the fact that this company has allowed for this much to be sent to this tiny town without investigation is completely bonkers.. Do liquor stores not feed and build their customers habits?  Yes it is bonkers and only shows how fucked our medical/pharma co.panies are.

Sort of late in the game now, and the closer a leader gets to the grave when they name a successor, the less the cronies will remain loyal to the chosen successor.. > does name a successor.  Dont need to name one. Just need to have one.  The consensus between people who understand politics in Russia is that it will be a no-name guy specifically groomed for this.
t3_7tjy5l	1	*	Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny detained by police at Moscow rally (Navalny on Twitter). Nothing to see here folks. Just normal Democratic competition. Does Russia still claim to be a democracy?. So does the US and were an oligarchy. . No we're more of a Republic with a weakness to certain oligaric practices.. Republicanism and democracy are in no way opposed; even so, we are not a true democracy for the obvious reasons that people who lose popular votes can win elections, and that we apportion districts in such a way that an entire block of voters within a state or region can be represented by the inverse of their aggregate preferences.. The biggest reason to call America a republic and not a democracy is actually the Senate, and how we assign votes to the electoral college. Every state has 2 senators, despite population. These 2 seats actually contribute 2 votes to your state's electoral college. This means that the lower the population of your state, the more your individual vote matters in national elections.. A republic is democracy, moron.. Oh, we definitely elect our representatives democratically, but we still are not a complete democracy. It's a fine line, I know, but it exists. That's actually what the framers intended, the rationale was that a complete democracy would result in mob rule, and looking at what happened to other countries around the same time (France) it was probably a pretty good call.

Hey Trump Voters, how many times did Trump say Mexico was going to pay?  . Your whole presidents never lie during election season is not helping your cause. . You think the lie is the problem?  Hmmm, please show me Obama telling a similiar lie? Keeping in mind Trump's is not just a lie but an unbelievably unbelievable lie that he was instantly called on.  So what was Obama or Clintons Mexico will pay for it lie?. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/. From your link: Of the nearly 800 detainees at one time held at the facility, today only 41 remain,  So he obviously did stuff and what is more is no one called him on it at the time oh and also? Congress blocked him because that is what GOP does.  So how much money has Mexico given? 0? And that is congress's doing?  Anything else?. No he didnt do anything. They were released normally like any jail does.. they went sent back to their countries. Plus Mexico will not pay for the wall. Or able to pay for anything. Can barely afford their own police force. Whenever thought Mexico would pay anything was dumb. . Lol, no he did, he made a promise that was sensible and possible and did all he could to make it happen.

t3_7vmlwt	1	*	Marijuana packaging rules should be left to health experts, not industry, Canadian Medical Association says: The association is also urging Ottawa to apply the same standards to marijuana as it does to prescription medication and prohibit health claims that are not backed by research.. I think the worrying trend is the anti-intellectualism that is growing among the society. Nobody believes scientists, doctors, and professors, and experts anymore.   To provide some information, there is strong evidence that  marijuana induces psychosis, paranoia, bronchitis, and altered development of developing brains. . Then why did you want it to be legal in the first place?. I personally am not for or against. But I think the argument is pot is no worse than tobacco and alcohol, and the latter two are legal.   I don't think narcotics such as heroin should be legal though. But I get into enough trouble debating with people on reddit about that.. So you believe that adults don't own their own bodies?. I'd rather my house not catch on fire because my neighbor was trying to make bootleg meth at 3am because they couldn't afford legal meth.  Since, you know, it's highly addictive and meth heads will routinely go completely fucking broke to get their next high.. Why would people make bootleg meth if meth were legal and available just like alcohol? Do a lot of people in your neighborhood make bathtub moonshine? If so, the problem is your neighborhood, not the legality of alcohol.. Alcohol isn't as addictive as meth. So what? Meth isn't as addictive as caffeine, but I don't see anybody making bootleg caffeine.

Think of it like investing in a new (software) technology that might catch on. Or supporting the developers of that project.

Sorta like how Taiwan is still technically part of mainland China.. They didn't sign a truce, that's for sure, only a cease-fire.. 60 years ago.

Just because he's declared bankruptcy a number of times, doesn't mean he's broke. In his case it just means he knows how to game the system.. See my other comment..

Armistices are usually temporary with a fixed term and are often used as an intermediate stage between actively fighting and a proper peace treaty, for negotiations and whatnot.  The Armistice of 11th November 1919, for example, was extended three times before the actual Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 that actually formally ended WWI.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but those bankruptcies were just business projects, not himself personally. That's one of the protections of forming a corporation.  Except of course that our fucked up tax system allowed him to carry those business losses so that he paid no personal taxes for years.. Tbh I don't know the specifics, don't really care to research anything to do with him.  Back on topic, that would just further reinforce the idea that he simply knows how to game the system.

War hasn't broken out between 2004 and 2018, which is 14 years. I'll take another 14 years of no war without hesitation.  edit: damn, c'mon people! I'm talking about artillery shelling, thousands upon thousands (or more, likely) of deaths, dire nuclear threats, etc. Not border incidents.. And if conflict ends up breaking after all in the future, you'll have a nice time enjoying the developed and sizable NK nuclear arsenal. No war is good but kicking a can down the road is definitely not. Delaying dealing with them for so long and letting them get nukes is what led to this nuclear threat in the first place, remember?. No when has delaying a war and trying at all costs to prevent one while one side increases it's size and strength ever gone badly?. Look I'm just a massive pussy alright? Really, I'm a 'centrist' and I believe in nothing and can't comprehend feeling anything beyond being able to buy cheap consumer goods.

The armistice halts military aggression between two countries, but it does nothing besides that, while a peace treaty establishes the conditions to ensure harmony between said countries.  Basically the peace treaty means the countries are solving the conflict, while the in the armistice they just stop fighting over it.

So does not demolishing churches , temples & mosques . Demolish every single one of them and turn them into schools, colleges and hospitals . If coal is backward then church is ancient shit .. Actually  What makes this particularly sad is there is so much history being knocked down here. The architecture of the building and how our foreparents lived is now forever lost. And even if you don't agree with religion, this is on par with an ancient hospital being knocked down. Super sad.. So basically never update infra structure with the age is your answer ? Just so we can have nicer memories of your fore fathers while exporting all the shit to the 3rd world countries . By your logic of preserving cultural heritage one might just ask why destroy the jungles and the rivers and the mountains at the altar of development but keep stupid buildings like churches for centuries .. Fair point about nature vs architecture (especially here in Australia where nature is our heritage) however it might help get your point across if you toned down your language.. Point taken . As an Indian we don't have any architecture that can compete with its natural beauty so I never really got the idea of architecture as a heritage . But it looks like many people love their church here .. What? On the contrary, India has ancient temples and no pristine nature remaining.

Its just as bad as elsewhere, she said.  Actual quote. Soooo am I supposed to believe her or the previous guy? I'm confused how do these stories get to the front page? . Both quotes were in the article. This got to the front page because people only read the headline and not the article. The story's weak with no quotes from relevant subject matter experts or data to show the level of smog reduction.. yeah that's what I was thinking as well. I could go out and survey 50 people, write about a prospective/ongoing project, and get it published based solely on personal opinions.

I live in one of the most diverse areas in Copenhagen, the city with the most Muslims in the country, and its really really rare to see anyone wearing that.

But also its possible that the ones who must wear it dont leave the house as much.. Mjollnerparken?. Nxf8rrebro Station. Grim. I know that neighborhood pretty well. Are you a Dane or a foreigner?. Foreigner. Ive also lived on Nxf8rrebrogade closer to the bridge, it was really nice there with all the cafes and stuff. Heres not so cool, but its ok still, I like the neighborhood in general.. I hosteled (is that a word? It is now) not far from Nxf8rrebro when I was in Copenhagen last year. Seemed like a pretty cool area to me, but I was only there for a week. Just out of curiosity, what specifically is not so cool about it?. I was referring to two different areas of Nxf8rrebro. The one with many cafes, restaurants and shops, by the bridge and the lakes, closer to downtown. The other area is where I live now, 15mins away by foot, where its not as touristy, its more like normal life, residential buildings, etc, even though theres still parks and culture around.

t3_7notvc	1	*	The United States is withholding $255 million in aid from Pakistan because of its failure to cooperate fully in Americas fight against terrorism, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday.. Didn't they intentionally hide Bin Laden?. No, he was such an excellent hider that he hid in a private gated community of top Pakistani military and  law enforcement officers for a decade. . Doesn't seem like a smart place to hide someone. No plausible deniability.. It actually seems to be a very smart place. One of the last places where the US and the incompetent and corrupt secret service of Pakistan would expect him.. The isi is anything but incompetent.. Yeah it's weird seeing the ISI always get listed as one of the top intelligence agencies in the world. You would think such an ass backwards place like Pakistan wouldn't have much reach but I guess there's a lot of incentive to maintain a strong agency when half the country is overrun with jihadists.. Half the country? That's a serious hyperbole. About the same as saying half of America is overrun by inbreeding Hicks. Americans would be much better if they were run by Californians and New Yorkers than anyone from the South. 
t3_7notvc	0	*	The United States is withholding $255 million in aid from Pakistan because of its failure to cooperate fully in Americas fight against terrorism, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday.. Probably should have began right after we found out they were hiding bin laden . Most of their aid was cut in 2010 for human rights abuses.  By 2011, they were only getting military aid- which is just a giveaway to US defense contractors, who use it to create good manufacturing jobs in key districts.  https://www.cgdev.org/page/aid-pakistan-numbers. How about we spend that money on cool shit we'd use at home instead of military equipment handouts to foreigners?. Most local cops don't need any more tanks.  They really do not.. Tanks are cool shit, but that's not really what I was suggesting.  How about spaceships, tramways, machining & tooling factories so we can stop manufacturing everything in china.... We already have tons of machining & tooling factories, which focus on mid to high end manufacturing, because it is pretty much impossible to get enough of a profit margin on low end manufacturing with US wages to make it a feasible business. We could lower wages, but I don't see factory workers keen to line up for sub $2 an hour wages.  . This is really what it boils down to. My cousin in China is raising a family on ~$7000 USD a year, with the understanding that Chinese companies are expected to pay for your room and board on top of your wages. Suffice to say you will not be surviving, much less raising a family, on half the minimum wage in America.. This is exactly what I tell people that exclaim Chinese workers are only making $x a day!! without looking at costs of living.

There's roughly another one or two hours of light after it; maybe less if you life in a valley. (also, sunset seems to be at ~17:30, which really is not the same as the 16:00 from the original post). Roll down to November 19.    With winter cloud cover it gets dark as shit, fast.  Trust me, by 1630-1700 it's extremely dark here.

The nations output is expected to account for more than 80 percent of global supply growth in the next decade. Why is gas 3$/ gallon if there is so much supply floating around?. oh americans, thinking 3$ a gallon is expensive, how cute. We also don't sit there and think about how much people spend abroad we still want that shit cheaper. . Doesn't mean it should be cheaper. . Are you not old enough to drive or something? . Are you old enough to not worry about climate change.. What does that mean? I do worry about climate change, that doesnt mean I shouldnt live my life, on another note the emissions that cars give off is a fraction of what gets dumped into oceans or is given off your nearest factory.

I'm sure this is going to help Tesla's solar division immensely considering they're manufactured in Buffalo NY.. This is very good for Tesla.  Imagine that, Trump did something good.. By helping Tesla have less competition? That is good?. Absolutely. Much easier for Tesla to grow if there's less competitors. . As someone who was just involved in pushing for their municipal utilities to invest in solar, this is devastating.  We have money put aside to buy solar panels, and now there's a tax that's going to raise the cost of solar across the board.  This is very, very bad.. So you don't want to support American manufacturing?. Not at the cost of slowing down our transition to renewables. If we are going to deal with climate change every delay could cost us our future.. This won't slow it down at all. You're acting like foreign solar panel manufacturers won't be able to sell their product to anybody now and that's simply not the case. They'll still sell their product and so will US solar panel manufacturers.

They're paid to be paranoid, probably safe isn't good enough. . Not on Huawei phones. Also iPhones are Chinese made.   Its a pretty bad excuse for protectionism but I guess it sounds good as propaganda. . IPhones are assembled by Chinese. Not made by them. The software is and parts are made in the US. Then shipped to china where ~~slaves~~ er... Workers assemble the parts. Lol, now idk how you are using the word made.   Also pretty interesting you call people that live in poorer countries slaves just because they make less money than you. . actually i think he calls them slaves because the manufacturers for smart phones have anti suicide nets set up on their rooftops. you know, because they treat their employees like slaves and enough of them try to commit suicide that you need anti suicide nets for the building.. Lol the one talking point people use over and over again.  You should check suicide rate vs suicide rate in other Asian countries. Pretty sure suicide rate in these places are lower than even average US population.  And no by definition people who work there freely are not slaves . Are we justifying employee suicide now?. that is a pretty dumb question. Within any population there will be a suicide rate, which part of that fact is justifying employee suicide?

Once it is done can't they just dig even lower and go under it?. It's Hamas, I bet they could just blow straight through it.. Yeah but isn't the main purpose smuggling? Secret tunnels are better for that. . Main purpose is attacking behind existing defensive lines around Gaza. People in Israel aren't smuggling things to Hamas.. A LOT of smuggling is happening. I assure you. Has nothing to do with Hamas or Israel. It has to do with enterprising outlaws making dat money. Every wall in the world is accompanied by smugglers looking to make money. . To West Bank I'm sure it's happening (to avoid tax at customs, not because goods can't go through).  But Gaza? I highly doubt it.. Gaza is in desperate need of a lot of things all the time. Which makes them more expensive. Smugglers love the cash cow that is a besieged city. . > Gaza is in desperate need of a lot of things all the time.  They get those things from Egypt. I very very very highly doubt they get anything from Israel. The surveillance on that border - there's just no way. Each tunnel to Israel is single use - Israel blows it up the moment it's used.

It would be egregious for a red voter to claim every left runner is antifa/alt left and that theyre as crooked as Clinton but not a single person believes that train of thought.

And there isnt a whole paedophile ring high up within the Democratic Party? (/s) but really though. Creeps are on the left and on the right. For every republican that has has this happen there has been a Democrat. Its a moot point. . No it isn't. It is a false equivalence. At present, a democratic senator resigned due to misogynistic behaviour, which was demanded by both Dems and Republicans. While at the same time, the RNC and Trump endorsed Moore.

Brazil is the most freshwater-rich country in the world, surprisingly enough. More than Russia and the US combined.. That's surprising.   I'm also surprised that the U.S. has more water total than Canada does. Canada definetly has more individual freshwater bodies though, likes lakes. Canada probably has more water total though if you count ice and snow. . Brazil has the Amazon. US has the Great Lakes (shared with Canada, I guess)-- those are huge and most are quite deep.. 6 quadrillion gallons in total. Enough to submerge all of North America and South America in 1 foot of water.

t3_7twdfu	1	*	Canadian Liberal caucus proposes decriminalization of illegal drug use, simple possession. Drug users just want to feel good.  Wanting to feel good should not be illegal.. Feeling good is a sin. Being a heroin addict is hell, which would make opiate abuse a sin, because sins take you to hell.. Not like the hell you will be put in by other human beings for your own good. I'd rather do a few years in prison than be a heroin addict.  Most addicts die by the time they're 40 or 50.. People who go into prison for drug related charges either die there or dont get the proper help they need.  Most will end up relapsing after release.  But please.  Lord what you would do over other people.. Prisons don't cure anyone, but their homicide and suicide rates are only about 4x the national average.  For most people in there they're safer than being on the outside.. Have fun then.  Bye bye.  We will miss you.

You are 100% right in your assertion, but people here wont want to hear it.. This conclusion hinges on some massive assumptions. are they really assumptions when half the media has been leaking stuff about this memo for 2 weeks while the other half ignored the memo calling it a conspiracy theory?  The memo itself is backed by FBI, DOJ, and IG findings and evidence looking into the matter. The memo is backed by evidence and has been being leaking for 2 weeks.. Yes.

We should let Kimmy il do his thing with his Elite in Pyongyang while the rest of his state waste away?  Everything is fine as long as it isn't affecting you directly right?. The fuck? I simply said the guys not an idiot. Total cunt but not an idiot. Not sure how you got to me being a psychopath and invading NK from there but you do you champ.. lmfao. I never said anything about invading NK lol. :D. We clearly have different definitions of the word 'liberated' then.

t3_7o83uj	1	*	North Korea accepts offer from South to meet for peace talks. If NK is sincere in this effort I have to imagine that it's because of Trump's insanely aggressive posturing.  Kim's regime does not want to risk a war because they'll probably lose and die, and Trump looks like he might be just crazy enough to start one.  Am I right, or are there other new factors in the two Koreas' relationship?. They have the bomb.  That's what they wanted.  Now they feel they cannot be dismissed like other despots.  This has zero to do with trump.  . You think that NK would be able to launch a missile at us if the US does a preemptive strike? We've had 50 years of planning for this shit. We have 17 MOABs ffs. We could erase NK off the nap in an hour without the use of nuclear weapons. It wouldn't. NK would launch a nuke at SK and thousands of people would die. That's not worth it even if the US could glass the entire northern half of the peninsula.. Its a preemptive strike, they wouldn't even see it coming. Yeah ok, I'm sure the US is going to just massacre millions of civilians in NK. As crazy as Trump is... idk if he's at war criminal level yet.. Well it's a war... Civilians always get hurt in wars. Dude, its one thing for civilian casualties in a war, its another thing entirely to commit a genocide larger than the holocaust in an hour. 
t3_7o83uj	1	*	North Korea accepts offer from South to meet for peace talks. The North Koreans are playing their cards well. I gotta admit, Kim Jong Un is pretty smart. . Can you explain your thought process a little bit more?. Hes driving a wedge between the US and the ROK by taking advantage of their anxiety about the Olympics.. This is also notable, but I believe that this plays a bigger role with the U.S. and the international community. . Does anyone really think there could be peace?    Would South Korea cede control of a unified country to the Kims?  Would Kim run for election in a democratically unified Korea?  Both those ideas seem laughable to me, but this has been a wild ride so who knows.. Does peace mean unification in this case? . Thats a tough question, but maybe unification could be accomplished in small steps over decades.  Though, I feel like once they remove the dmz and allow for free travel there will be severe skirmishes between an extremely propagandized people and the democratic society theyve been bred to hate.. >but maybe unification could be accomplished in small steps over decades.  Wont happen.  Don't forget what Kim did to solidify his power.  He's not going to give up power for unification and the South wont accept a dictator.  They'd also have no reason to unify under the leader of an impoverished isolated nation.

Meanwhile Hamas keeps on attacking.. The PA presented many plans which Israel rejected. The PA's plans were fair. Israel's proposals' weren't even close to fair.. The PA in the past wouldnt even come to the table unless terrorists were released from jail...besides the fact that they pay them.. The PA attended countless peace talks prior to that. That event you are talking about was in 2014 when Israel pledged to release prisoners that it had been promising to release since Oslo (part of Oslo was that Israel must release palestinians detained prior to Oslo).

At least we get to decide which awful shit to put in our bodies now. ^(/s). And  while I know you're writing /s,  i just wanna add about that sovereignty thing... Britain will still have enormous pressure to try to follow most EU market rules and regs, but now they won't have any say in what those regulations are. . Enormous pressure doesn't mean mandatory though. In the sense that they can tank their economy in refusal sure, but if they want to export anything to the EU they do.

But I don't see any reason for optimism. Even if it could go well, that's a separate proposition from Theresa May being able to make it go well. I'd say there's a decent chance it just won't happen in the end. . The Northern Irish issue will be bigger than most Brits anticipate.

Time for another debate about the controversial idea that ice melts when things get hot.. Who cares. . People who don't like watching mass extinctions of animals that live in these places?. There is no mass extinction of polar bears happening. . There's a mass extinction of many animals in fact we're in the fastest mass extinction event right now and given the way in which Polat Bears ecosystems are being destroyed it'd be good to protect them. A temporary rise due to hunting laws isn't going to save them in the long run.. None of what you said changes the fact that a mass extinction of POLAR BEARS is not happening. The exact opposite is happening. Worldwide polar bear populations are at the highest they've ever been recorded.   I completely agree that climate change is a real issue that needs addressing, I just don't think the fake polar bear hysteria is helping anything. . >a mass extinction of POLAR BEARS is not happening.

t3_80bu9v	0	*	Trump says Filipinos dont have drug problem because they kill dealers  report. you know trump does kind of have a point here though, maybe we should hand down harsh sentences for dealers.. No. We should decriminalize, tax fairly and fund programs for education, mental health and substance dependence. . If you are dealing Fentanyl laced drugs, you should be going away for a long, long time.. Which is why it should be decriminalized and taxed, and regulated.. Which wouldn't stop people from dealing it. It would allow addicts a safer way to purchase drugs that they know aren't laced, and would remove the stigma of drug use allowing addicts to get the help they need.. Legalizing it isn't going to get addicts off them. They need treatment, not more drugs. More drugs are only going to kill more people.. Right, except an addict isn't going to get treatment if they don't want it. They're not usually out here overdosing because they want to, they usually overdose due to unregulated strength of drugs mixed with the potential for it to be laced. So open up both avenues for them to explore, and reduce drug crime and deaths throughout the country.

I have read about George Soros, and to my knowledge, he generally supports good things (gay rights, opposition of Russia's corruption, drug policy reform, etc), and is willing to put his money where his mouth is. That makes him a good person. Do you have any counterexamples?. He's rich and Jewish. That's all a lot of people need.. Ah. Now it makes much more sense.. not really, he destabilised countries, funded riots and has a hard left leaning globalist agenda, that's why they don't like him, basically the left version of rupert murdoch. > hard left leaning globalist agenda  What is a 'hard left leaning globalist agenda'? . One global tyrannical government with open borders and no chance of economic upward mobility for people. . Pretty sure he isn't a Republican...
t3_7w3jdz	1	*	George Soros is reportedly backing a campaign to stop Brexit.. All the rich that give two shits about public spending want to preserve their lucrative business arrangements and subvert the democratic process.. Funding a campaign to influence the democratic process is part of the democratic process. If he were funding politicians to vote against then that would be subverting the democratic process.  . The democratic process is over. He wants to have a second vote to reverse the majority will expressed in the first vote. You act like Brexit issue wasnt voted on already.. Having another vote would still be democratic. . That's like saying having another election right after one election is democratic.. Happens all the time. Especially when no government can be formed by the negotiator . Happens only in exceptional cases where there is no stable government.. And as well all know, Mays government is exceedingly strong and stable^^^^TM
t3_7w3jdz	1	*	George Soros is reportedly backing a campaign to stop Brexit.. I mean... Brexit could be terrible, but the British people voted for it. Are we really going to cheer on some mega rich guy subverting democracy?. Apparently democracy is not good when I don't get it my way.. So democracy means people only get to vote on things once and that's final?. Eventually you could have a revote, but you can't just immediately do it. You need to see the people's will through.. That's ridiculous. And how can you call it the people's will when the people were deliberately misinformed.. Misinformed is not a code word for anyone who does not agree with you. Get over yourself.. No, the Leave campaign actively lied, then all the leaders of the campaign ran away as soon as their side won, leaving everyone else to clean the bed. . That's the socially acceptable way of saying the other side is dumb  They just disagreed with you, and they won. If you want to change it, vote in a different government

Basically what they're saying is that Ireland should take the money for themselves. If they aren't doing it then the EU is going to take it.  At this point it's unclear why Ireland doesn't bulge and just accept free money.  Apple will have to pay either way.. Because Apple may just go, leaving many unemployed.. 5500 people is plenty for Ireland, but Apple isn't an irreplaceable employer.. But other companies that are getting the same deal in Ireland may leave before the EU forces them to pay too.. Isn't the point of this lawsuit that Apple's deal is different when compared to other companies?. Ireland's government has been giving away sweetheart tax deals like candy on Halloween.. Do you have good sourcing on this? From what I've heard, Apple is exceptional, and the fact that the EU is only attacking the Apple deal right now seems to suggest that it's unique..

As a Canadian I felt helpless when they told me they needed to go through my cellphone and laptop. Otherwise, it would mean I would be banned from the USA for a few years. Literally went through all my personal WhatsApp messages, even reading some of them out loud. Nothing I hate more than the people they have hired at the border.. Same thing happened to me as an American going to Canada. Those customs officers were straight up assholess. Its so rough man.. I sometimes wonder if they go through special training to be the biggest dicks.. What if I remove the battery from my phone before making the crossing? Would that help me at all?   Sure my password is XYZ123 but the phone doesn't work . Just back it up to the cloud and clear it.  Its suspicious, but theres nothing to look at.  Restore once you are clear.  . So don't let someone look at it but freely upload everything to someone else?. Bingo,  There is no such thing as the cloud, its just someone elses computer.. Lol

Literally went through all my personal WhatsApp messages, even reading some of them out loud. Nothing I hate more than the people they have hired at the border.. Wonder what they would do with a corporate encrypted laptop that has NDA stuff on it that no one under any circumstance is allowed to see...  Welp sorry but GTFO since you won't comply!. Standard policy now is to send blank laptops on work travels and VPN in upon arrival, for a lot of companies.. So could this practice be used for regular folks?   Sorry officer this is a work phone they sent me with. YES! Spycraft is now everyday stuff. Dont cross a border with a loaded machine.. > Spycraft is now everyday stuff.   I find it not the least bit surprising that in response to the relatively minor threat of terrorism regular citizens and businesses have had to adapt spycraft for dealing with their own governments.  . I agree. But its also sort of fucking sweet. I mean think about it as kid-you.  *One day youre going to have to learn how to be super sneaky and hide things very well so nobody can access it. Youll be like James Bond.*  *But you have no right to privacy. Terrorist.*. Yea well kids think lots of onerous shit might actually be awesome. I remember being a wee little lad and asking my grandfather this ridiculous question: What was your favourite part of WW2?  Given how war is presented in media it occurred to me at an early age that it was awesome and spectacular, instead of horrifying and destructive to a human being's soul.
t3_7oeq9i	1	*	Warrantless phone, laptop searches at the US border hit record levels. Another reasonable reason for tourists to consider vacationing elsewhere.. Canadian here. Traveled everywhere. Lots to the US but frankly the warrantless searches at the border and civil forfeiture on the other side make me avoid the US even for flight transfers. You have to fully enter the country just to transfer. . Canada does the same shit as the USA but without carrying the reputation with it. They may not but completely equal but Canada is strict at the border as well. . Yep. They held me in a room for 2 hours while they went through my computer and phones, etc. Treated me like a criminal. . I wonder if I'd look more like a criminal if I decided not to bring a computer or phone across the border. If I'm on vacation, I could live without these items...just bring a camera with an empty memory card...mail it back to myself before heading home. Border agents would have nothing to look at.. Doesn't matter, if you don't have it they can't search it. And they can't detain you for not having a device on your person.. I know they can't, but my point was that our society is so connected these days, I'm guessing that a young person without a cell phone might raise some flags. Just the nature of seemingly going against the grain.. Fair enough. 
t3_7oeq9i	1	*	Warrantless phone, laptop searches at the US border hit record levels. Cant you just say Im a US citizen. Youre welcome to attempt to look at my stuff once you secure a warrant.. > US citizen  so what are international travelers supposed to do now? just put up with this shit? that's why fewer and fewer of us europeans feel like traveling to the usa.. Store everything on the cloud, go thru border, Vpn in, download what you need, wipe it before you head back.  Been doing it for years.. > Store everything on the cloud  You... uh... you know that the cloud is just another name for someone else's computer, right?. 2007 called and they want their witticism back.   At one point the cloud was just another name for that, yes. We are over a decade past that point. You look at the sheer complexity at what is happening in that space summarizing it like you did just doesnt reflect the real world.. Lmao what? The cloud is still just someone else's computer. There's no two ways about it. . alright you have convinced me. You clearly know everything about this topic.. What is it if that's not correct? Genuine question

t3_7xz31y	0	*	U.K. Supermarkets To Ban Energy Drinks For Shoppers Under 16. So when will Starbucks be asked to stop selling candy-flavored espresso to children?. What product are you talking about?. Almost the entire menu?  Starbucks wouldn't sell nearly as well if you called their products what they are: milkshakes. . Seattle's Best sold a legit coffee milkshake and it was 1300 calories fr a medium. It had 12 oz of ice cream for a medium and 16 oz for a large.  A  Pound  Of  Ice  Cream. I have a question: I keep seeing KFC coffee labelled 'Seattle's Best', but I and multiple people have pointed out that, at least in the UK, Seattle has *absolutely no* reputation for coffee *at all*, so saying 'Seattle's Best' holds very little value. Why do they do that?. That's probably because many people don't know [this.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_in_Seattle). Seattle is regarded as a world centre for coffee roasting  Really? Uh... by who? I've had many conversations over the years about coffee, and some about Seattle, and the only times I've ever heard them mentioned together are when someone asks why they bothered to write 'Seattle's best' on KFC coffee cups.. Seattle, and the Pacific northwest in general, is the coffee hub of North America. There are more coffee shops and roasters there than pretty much anywhere in the world. 
t3_7xz31y	0	*	U.K. Supermarkets To Ban Energy Drinks For Shoppers Under 16. Will they also ban coffee for people under 16 as well?.  No. . Well that's just silly then.. Coffee is no where near as bad as energy drinks. For one thing a little bit a day can be good for you.  It also isn't nearly as easy to drink so much it gives you a heart attack. . Hah we found the person addicted to coffee guys U0001f601  Oh the caffeine product I drink is healthy!  When in reality coffee is full of a pretty potent carcinogen called acrylamide.

t3_7xz31y	1	*	U.K. Supermarkets To Ban Energy Drinks For Shoppers Under 16. So when will Starbucks be asked to stop selling candy-flavored espresso to children?. What product are you talking about?. Probably frappuccinos. That shit is diabetes in a cup. Used to work at starbucks for six years. A tall (small, 12oz/354ml) frappuccino ranges from like 400-600 calories but usually goes past 600 because kids want extra whip cream and extra caramel.. Holy shit that's basically an entire meal's worth of calories for a kid. The rule of thumb is to not drink calories. Pretty much everything other than water, tea, coffee or water infused with fruits is going to be high in sugar and calories.   . Well sure, but on the flip side Coke is fucking delicious. . IMO Diet Coke is much nicer. Normal Coke is too sweet. But this is British coke - I don't know how much variation there is.. Mexican Coca Cola is the best, because they use real sugar cane not high fructose shit.
t3_7orglw	1	*	Iran bans English in primary schools after leaders' warning. This will definitely be good for long term Iran.... What they'll need in this century is Chinese.. English isnt going to magically go away. English is as close to a universal language that we have.. Not to mention, Chinese would rather learn English than have English speaker learn Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese).   Still, I imagine a lot of countries will start encouraging their students to learn Chinese, if they haven't already. My Spanish speaking country has a good relationship with China and they are sending over people to teach Mandarin to students who will enter into the business world.. Also it doesn't blow an English speakers mind when someone who isn't white speaks English. Speaking Mandarin in China is incredibly frustrating, because half of the time if they're from a rural area they don't know what to do with the fact that a laowai is speaking Mandarin to them. In their minds, Mandarin is too difficult for a foreigner to learn.. >Speaking Mandarin in China is incredibly frustrating, because half of the time if they're from a rural area they don't know what to do with the fact that a laowai is speaking Mandarin to them.   In rural areas maybe, in tier 1 or 2 cities, people are accustomed to Mandarin speaking foreigners   Source:lived and worked in China for over 5 yrs. Except tier 1 and 2 cities are also filled with migrant workers.. If they are migrant workers from rural China, they most likely don't speak Mandarin themselves 
t3_7q559g	0	*	The U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands finally admits 'no-go zone' claims were false. US media needs to adopt this approach.  Broadcasters like NPR should lead the charge.  It'll be really hard to accuse NPR of being fake news.  They are impeccable.  Remember to support your local pbs and NPR stations, kids.. Do you remember that 18 year old at the Michael Brown anniversary who was shot by the police? The one who was *shooting* at the police? NPR forgot to mention that, they just said Black teen shot by police.. So that makes them fake news?  Do you call fox fake news whenever they don't report every detail of a story?  Or do you just reserve that for the libtard media?  Your argument is weak and illogical.  Try again.. They didn't just forget to report minor details. They strategically left out an important detail to create the wrong impression. . Source please. NPR is on the radio.. No shit.  I'm asking you for backup for the claims you made.  You know like the audio or the news article.  That'd be a starting point.. It may be in their archives but that would be really hard to find. It may have been a local broadcast too which would make it even more difficult.   But seriously, even NPR's former CEO admits that they're biased:  https://nypost.com/2017/10/21/the-other-half-of-america-that-the-liberal-media-doesnt-cover/
t3_7q559g	1	*	The U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands finally admits 'no-go zone' claims were false. He admitted he was shocked by statements he made into a fucking camera, a week into refusing to comment on ever having said it, and calling the implication fake news?  The best people. He denied everything *even with video evidence* and called it fake news. It makes you wonder how many times Trump claimed fake news when it was actually the truth. How deep in denial do you have to be to honestly think everything against Trump and his administration is fake news when there are so many situations exactly like this one. . >It makes you wonder how many times Trump claimed fake news when it was actually the truth.   Not really. If Trump claims fake news you know it's the truth...just one he either does not like or one he cannot publicly admit to.  Notice how he has never claimed fake news on something positive about himself?  . Well, after reading Fire & Fury, I'd say it's more likely that Trump has been told by his advisers that the news is fake.  Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity; and pretty much anything Trump does is adequately explained by stupidity.. I think there's a lot of stupidity and malice.. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity, but don't rule out malice.   - Hanlon's razor . Is that really the saying in full? but don't rule out malice?. According to wiki
t3_7q559g	1	*	The U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands finally admits 'no-go zone' claims were false. No, he's not shocked he said that. The shock he had was when the Netherlands press corps wouldn't let him get away with his lies and then lying about lying.. Kudos to the Dutch and their reporters for not letting this shit fly!. Reminds me of Trump's first press conference in Germany where he gave his usual evading bullshit answer to questions and the entire gathered press just laughed at his stupidity.. When you have a country with a functional education system, that's what tends to happen. . Here in the US we have a public education system where youre obligated to pledge allegiance to a flag. The problem with pledging allegiance to a flag is you end up going whichever way the wind blows.. Eh. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me.. To me?

Like that guy that drew penises around all the potholes around town to get them fixed.. That wouldn't work in Russia unfortunately, hence they have to write the typically long Russian surname.. I remember there was a series of pictures where a guy was writing butt on an old dirty house wall, and it kept getting painted over until the whole wall became painted brand new  Edit: [here is](http://warnet.ws/91382) part of it, and [another one](https://meduza.io/galleries/2015/07/02/hudozhnik-s-pomoschyu-graffiti-zastavil-vlasti-pokrasit-budku) mentioned by u/Norma5tacy. In east London a guy figured out that the city only painted over the small graffitied portions of the walls and with a lazily similar color. Over time he wrote buff this in small areas and the city would cover them up.  In the end he made the city paint a huge F.U. on the side of a building. Last time I was in London it was still there.. Got a pic?.

A bit odd, but hey if it works...... Until someone catches you.. *The Gang Commits Suicide*. Is Cloudy in Siberia Always. The funny thing is that there is a Russian version of It's Always Sunny, called It's Always Sunny in Moscow. And it basically reuses the plots in the original, just in Russian. I watched it and thought it was pretty entertaining, but apparently actual Russians hated it.. Probably because it had no Danny DeVito. True, but the Russian version was basically season 1 of the American version, which also had no Frank. I for one think a Russian Frank Reynolds would easily rival the American one.. the problem is humor styles don't necessarily translate across cultures  IASIP has a certain attitude about it that might just leave russians cold (well, colder than they already are)

I wouldn't be surprised if Navalny shot himself in the head 4-5 times in the coming weeks, or forgot to de-radiate his tea. . Open and shut case, Dimitri. Saw this once as a rookie: apparently, he shot himself in the back three times, stuffed himself into a duffle bag, and threw himself off a bridge and into the river.. This basically happened to a British secret agent, and the inquest found it was an accident.  (To be fair, he had a habit of locking himself in duffel bags and challenging himself to escape). Dude, you buy that shite? The professionals couldn't reproduce this particular bit of legerdemain, and the only proof of any habits is from recent search history, which can be doctored and/or input later.  Bottom line, if you don't think this was a state-sponsored homicide, you're not looking at the same incident.. Definitely the lad was murdered. but whether it was a professional killing by a foreign government (to the level where no evidence was left) or by the British government (and the police got a lot of weight put on them to rule it a suicide)
t3_7xqok2	1	*	Moscow residents say they have found that the only way to get the council to clear snow is to write the name of opposition leader Alexei Navalny on it..

Best thing for snow removal is a sled shovel. I can clear my (rather large) driveway in about 8 minutes.. I'm from Canada, we had two of those growing up.. I imagine the only choices that far north is to own one, own a snowplow, or have a bad back by the time you're 20.. Or live somewhere civilized where you don't have your own half-acre to clear by yourself.
t3_7x50sa	1	*	The Islamic Centre of Ireland has issued a fatwa against female genital mutilation. But who will be the first to issue a fatwah against fatwahs?. What's your problem with fatwas?. there should only be civil law. You actually think a fatwa or any islamic law has any legal standing in Ireland?. Historically speaking, the Catholic Church has issued it's own orders in Ireland, which were followed. So don't be getting all righteous about fatwahs. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck.... Thankfully we've moved beyond that.. In the RC church there are encyclicals as well as public statements by the pope on various issues.. Yeah, and nobody (here at least) cares about them any more.
t3_7x50sa	1	*	The Islamic Centre of Ireland has issued a fatwa against female genital mutilation. We dont have FGM in Saudi Arabia, hence it isnt an islamic issue to begin with, it is really an African tradition, which is why it is a common problem in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea even among christian population.  . True.  Additionally: when are people going to talk about male genital mutilation or is that too edgy?. FGM is analogous to getting the tip of your penis cut off. Male circumcision is just getting your foreskin trimmed, completely different than FGBM.. Not true whatsoever. Getting your foreskin cutoff basically develops intense calculus all over the tip of the penis which is developed from the same tissue as the clitoris.  Your analogy is fucking retarded.. Yeah tell this to the American Academy of Pediatrics.  [The Ethical Course Is To Recommend Infant Male Circumcision  Arguments Disparaging American Academy of Pediatrics Affirmative Policy Do Not Withstand Scrutiny](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1073110517750603?journalCode=lmec). >  failure to recommend male circumcision early in infancy may be viewed as akin to failure to recommend childhood vaccination to parents.    Sounds very objective and unbiased indeed.  . I would recomend reading the statements by WHO and CDC which are the largest and most well established health organizations in the world  and they state things such as multiple health benefits as a prophylactic procedure and very minimal risks. Not great enough to warrant routine circumcision but more than enough to allow parents and pt doctors to do important medical decisions for their infants.. Do you mean the part where they don't recommend circumcision?  Medical necessity must be shown to overrule somone's body autonomy rights.

The problem is, people assume Freedom of Speech equates Freedom from Speech. Two different things. . And then there are people who think that freedom of speech also means freedom from repercussions for said free speech. . But there are also people who think that not being free from repercussions justifies enacting violence against people who say things they disagree with.   Also witch hunting people and harassing people and their workplaces trying to get them fired because they disagree with what someone says.. If you're a nazi promoting nazi ideology, you should expect your employer to be called. This is America.. If someone is an actual nazi, sure. 99% of the people being called 'nazis' in today's day and age are not nazis.. But that particular guy I don't like surely falls in those 1% (c) everybody.

The IRA (basically troll factory) in St. Petersburg only has about 1000 people working there and their website traffic to reddit is a drop in the ocean compared to the millions of people visiting reddit from all around the world. Plus Russia & Belarus barely have any english speakers so reddit blocking traffic from those countries would hardly do anything.. Lol, only 1000.  I think you need to multiply that number. 1000 people can puppet a lot of accounts.

The Mueller team is really getting somewhere and spending our money wisely.. >Looking into.      Do you not know what the point of an investigation is for? . I thought they were looking into collusion with Russia and the Trump campaign, this seems like it would be out of the scope of such an investigation.. You must just be confused on account of you don't have any fucking clue what you're talking about. His mandate includes investigating any potential crimes that are uncovered in course of the investigation the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia.. So a Russian donating to the NRA is a crime?. Funneling Russian money through the NRA to the Trump campaign?  Yes, that would be a crime. Glad I could clear that up for you.. How can you prove that? lol yeah a Russian donated money and earmarked it for trump campaign only  this is a waste of resources, sorry if you think this is something, it is nothing, but you are too dumb to realize that, so I expect you will continue to believe in something coming from nothing. . Forensic accounting is pretty cool.  
t3_7qpiaz	1	*	Over 1,800 Islamic Scholars in Pakistan declare suicide attacks haram. I'm Muslim myself (Turk living in Germany) and every Imam I met my entire life said that suicide is one of most haram things a Muslim can do. It is literally the first thing they teach muslims. Sometimes I think the middle east got another form of Islam.. Most people in the Mid East are against suicide. In Islam, killing yourself is one of the worst crimes.. Depends where in the middle east, but [on average](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/pg-2014-07-01-islamic-extremism-10/) about 25% of the population thinks suicide bombing is often or sometimes justified.  In Pakistan, the percentage is really low when compared to other Muslim countries.. Not justifying it but the context/dichotomy of this in such people's minds is that either you kill yourself and have a chance at killing others... or you will get blown up by a drone. In such situation, every human being, regardless of religion, will do the same. The first airplane/suicide bombing was actually done by a Sikh.. So was suicide bombing introduced as a concept after drones were invented? . No but the spike in support of it did after drone strikes killed a shit ton of innocent people. Plus i thought you guys were high on due process, that is catching the criminal and trying him in court instead of a summary execution. That is no concern to you anymore?. 0/10 troll. Reported . lol
t3_7qpiaz	1	*	Over 1,800 Islamic Scholars in Pakistan declare suicide attacks haram. Anyone who needs someone else to tell them that murder-suicide is wrong is already insane.. They aren't insane if they truly believe in the shit.  If you truly believed that there was a heaven, and that by killing yourself in battle against an enemy of Islam then it is actually very rational to do it if you think you are going to a better place.  Why stay around in your miserable existence if you think you will be going to heaven just by blowing yourself up?. This apologist crap for people that are flat horrible needs to end.    Stop trying to justify that bullshit.. You need to understand the mindset of these people and not just dismiss them. Look at the holocaust. Do you truelly think all germans that were part of the army are horrible people? Do you think we should never try to explain their behaviour, if not to pardon them at least to prevent the thing from happening again?. Literally apples and oranges and not something I even remotely implied.  All I'm saying is that making excuses for these asshats is exactly the wrong way to go about it.. But he is not making excuses. He is explaining their mindsets, because explaining the mindset of horrible people enables us to:  * Fight them if necessary  * Prevent ourselves from becoming monsters. if necessary?  What? we absolutely need to fight them. Jesus, you guys literally look for a fight in every fucking post without even taking the time to understand it.   He is talking about horrible people, not specifically ISIS, in the last part of his statement. Enables refer to that. And you don't need to fight every horrible people. Doing it actually caused the situation, thus the appearance of even more horrible people.  Jeez.

I used to think that if I raised my kids right and inspired my students to do something it would have an impact. I dont know any more. . The only positive is that major cities of many wealthy countries are threatened by rising sea levels, and fleeing migrants will cause significant amounts of economic damage. This means that a united response from multiple nations should happen.. The united response to major threats in the past has tended to be Let's all start a war.. The worst timeline would be people fighting each other for resources while ignoring the problem, the best would be a unified massive 'war' against CO2 levels, with trillions in R&D and manufacturing..

A cut to the throat is certainly more humane than the way most animals are killed in America. There is a reason it's the normal way to slaughter animals by hand, and kill people with a knife. . Most animals are killed with a bolt to the brain like the one in No country for Old Men.  That is instant and painless.  Bleeding to death is terrifying.. except they often don't die, and are strung up by their legs, still twitching and squirming in death throws. i dunno, the deaths of animals in factory farms is pretty brutal. . I'm sure there are halal slaughters that don't go well also.  For the most part the bolt in the brain is universally accepted to be the most humane form of killing livestock by educated, secular people.  That is a simple fact.. I'm sure there is. I'm just saying that it's not a crazy or weird way to kill animals. I know a few small-scale farmers, and they generally kill animals with a knife to the neck. . It's not crazy or weird to kill an animal by cutting its throat. That's been practiced across all different cultures for millennia.  What's crazy and weird is to claim that it's more humane than the current industry standard used in secular countries despite all evidence contrary.. I hope I didn't say it was strictly better than those bolt guns. I'm just saying the bolt guns have issues, and the knife is not a horrible idea.

Farmers are unlikely to kill it, they get compensated for damages anyway.. Reasonable farmers wont kill it, but there are idiots in every profession. Wolves are protected in Germany as well, but some asshole still shot the first wolf to wander through NRW. Source or stfu. Since you seem to lazy to google it yourself, here you go:   https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/umwelt/article106221094/Westerwald-Wolf-mit-grosskalibriger-Waffe-erschossen.html. I searched it but couldn't find anything about a farmer killing a wolve.   Welp, thanks for the source but me living in Munsterland, there are a couple of wolve packs in the forests here. And we love them. . Oh really? I live in Mxfcnsterland too, but i must have missed that. I only knew of a few solitary wolves wandering through the area, not whole packs. There was a wolf in my area for a bit, but sadly she died in a car crash.. :(

Took a look at yourself you believe the pee tapes are real and the whitehouse didn't confirm those claims yet you still believe it.  What does that tell me? That you will belive any negative claims about Trump and whether it is actually confirmed is completely irrelevant to you..

t3_7s6k5t	0	*	Trump used accent to imitate India's prime minister Narendra Modi. A guy whose accent is imitated and mocked every day on T.V. Imitates someone else.

You hold the president and entertainers to the same standard?. No, I have no problem when people do accents. I think it is fun to try to imitate a regional accent. I'm just not feigning racism and taking up bullshit causes because someone white imitated someone brown. If Donald Trump did an Irish accent no one would give two shits. Hell Barack would actually go to the south and do a standard black person accent to appeal to them more.. Bullshit. Accents are racist, a crutch, and in poor taste from comedians. Coming from the commander in chief, they're beyond poor taste. Trump and every other president is subject to higher standards and expectations than a stand up comic or talk show host. Because he's *the president* and not *a talk show host*.. > Accents are racist, a crutch, and in poor taste from comedians.  Also hilarious if done right.. Trump doesn't have the timing, let alone a coherent train of thought, to do one right. . Let's be fair, that dude is a meme factory..

Electric cars heat the batteries now, so the cold is not a problem.. I have few friends in Vestfold, that have 5 years old cars, don't complain much, but first thing they said when asked - in winter need to be more careful.

I believe in democratic self-determination. For Ireland, for Scotland, for Catalan, for Tibet, and for Crimea. Crimea voted. Ukraine brought out the guns.. Ireland doesnt want it, Scotland doesnt want it. So that renders your point invalid, because you want self-determination for countries that dont want it themselves. You say that Crimea is free because of a vote and thus should have the ability to self-govern, but also believe the same for Scotland that actually voted against self-determination? Nice one bud.. Ireland IS independent, bud. Fair enough about Scotland. The vote failed, fair enough. I don't support their independence then, because they don't. The vote won in Crimea.

It should be. I know a few women who have gone there solo. I'm thinking of going there with my kids (they'll be 5 and 7).. Thank you! I have been to the Middle East, and was fine, but its so hard to get an honest opinion because a lot of Americans have this really weird idea that anywhere non-western is uncivilized and you will die. I will definitely look into it, and I hope you have fun with your kids!. I think Westerners are fearful of the uneducated/religious people that inhabit those countries. I personally wouldnt consider most of the 54 African countries safe due to those types of people and the amount of corruption that is rampant.. Yeah, thats the thing. I am sure like anywhere there are safe parts and awful parts. Its just tough as a tourist trying to figure that out, and what the cost is if you make a mistake. I can handle harassment and minor stuff, as thats a daily thing in America already, I just don't want to end up in a horrific situation. .

Granted, it has gotten a lot better, but there's still reason to be very careful.. I had a stone last year. Went to my family doctor, specialists, imaging, medicine. Never paid a dime.. Which is nice, but I'm talking about chronic conditions. The stuff you actually get insurance for because it would cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.. My shit cost thousands, don't see why they wouldn't pay for that if they paid for this.. My dad went to Switzerland for his bladder stones. Cost him 150 franks. He could have had it done at home for free but he trusts Swiss doctors more.  Point being, no. It doesn't cost thousands. You get charged thousands. Big difference.. idgaf about how you define it. i didn't pay shit.
t3_7suq8c	1	*	Biden calls Russia biggest threat to international order - Under President Putin, Russia is working with every tool available to them to whittle away at the edges of the European project, test the fault lines of western nations and return to a politics defined by spheres of influence, Biden said.. I mean its almost as if this was predicted like 6 years ago by Mitt Romney while Obama sat and laughed his Cold War jokes off with the rest of the left.. Remember how Hollywood culture laughed at how conservatives in the 90s and 00s bad mouthed commies?. Russia isn't communist. Why? Because their centrally planned economy failed and the government owned markets were sold to the most powerful mafia families in the Communist party?  They still believe in their social commie agenda, they just slapped a new coat of paint on the old oligarchy of the Communist party!. Soviet Union was a corrupted oligarchy hiding behind communism, Russia is a corrupted oligarchy hiding behind democracy. >Soviet Union was a corrupted oligarchy  Excellent point!  However:  [America is an oligarchy, not a democracy or republic](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/)  So based on that do you think America is in for a similar collapse?  Or, do you think the current Oligarchy will maintain its status in America?  . I'm not American and I definitely agree that America is an oligarchy because of how the US finances elections (aka mostly private, if not entirely private money paying for candidates). It doesn't mean the US will collapse though. It could change completely, it could not change at all, who knows, I'm a just a simple redditor. Aren't we all.

Gates has agreed to testify against Manafort.  Are you really attempting to claim those people have no connections to the Donald Trump presidential campaign?. Theyre not going down for collusion with Russia. . Yeah, they just have a bunch of information and are giving federal testimony for Mueller because their hands are totally clean of Russian involvement.  That was the mental gymnastics equivalent of jumping as high as you can and landing directly on your face. Want to try again? The Russian judge looked particularly pleased with your efforts.. All that information has paid off after a year right? Oh wait, Russian trolls are more important than finding people who colluded with Russia.. Wow *one whole entire year*?!

So no, there's a feud. A big one. And its just driving Pence and Trump absolutely insane.. The Vice President lied about his positions on homosexuality and gay conversion therapy. This isnt a matter of enemy or friend, hes being called out for an outright falsehood and claiming the athlete in question was simply misinformed. He couldve just told the truth rather than try to cut and run like he did. When and we're did he say he was pro gay conversion therapy? Links plz. So I can show my friend in denial.. It's on his website, but you should note it's always worded to demonstrate clearly that it's an entirely voluntary thing. This is why you'll never convince any of his supporters that it's proof that he's the worst thing to happen to gays in the US over the past decade.  Fucked up? Sure. Nazi-esque? Not really.. > Nazi-esque?  Yes really, saying it's toooootally voluntary until you're in charge is very nazi like..

There happened to be nazis at this rally as well as antifa terrorists. I doubt he was referring to those groups when he said there were some very fine people there. Do you not think there were very fine people at the rally?. Antifa terrorists  I'm sorry, which side drove a car into a crowd of people again?  Who did the Antifa terrorists kill?  To me it looks like the Trump supporters at the rally were the terrorists.. which side dresses like ISIS? which side plans to interrupt other rallies specifically with intent to hurt people? which side has thrown m-80s into crowds and attacked unarmed citizens in sneak attacks with weapons. which side literally says capitalism is evil?   ANTIFA

Any large global car company is global these days.. Not so much. The American market has been shaped to be more like the Euro market in recent decades, rather than the other way round.  Euro cars from Ford and GM were smaller, more efficient, safer, cheaper to make and better to drive, they were also profitable. Eventually the US arms of the companies realised this and started using the Euro platforms.. In recent decades? The first generation Ford Mustang was advertised as being very european.. Im sure it was, these days however, to us, its a huge agricultural whale of a car.

You're right, except I'd add that in this case, definitions *haven't* changed. The word antisemitism literally never meant anything except hatred of Jews. The word semite never meant merely the Jews, including in the 18th century, when antisemitism was invented. It's just one of common cases where the literal etymology of the word doesn't tell the whole story.. Definitions can change, Arabs can adopt the term just like Jews did before. . Jews didn't adopt the term. An anti-Semite was the one who coined the word.
t3_7s4w7o	1	*	Saudi Arabia agrees to let princes go for $100 billion. Wow $100b sounds like some fake number people would make up. Guess there are such rich people too.. Jeff Bezos could pay that bill. . Not exactly.. Sure he could but he would need to either sell his Amazon stocks or use them as collateral to borrow against.. You can't just sell what is probably like 80 billion in shares. I don't think any brokerage would take the trade of a CEO dumping his entire stake in his own company. Not for nearly $1,300/share at least.  The largest loan to date is $60 billion dollars, I don't see any company or even a group of companies doing that for $80,000,000,000+. Maybe if he tried it would send he economy into a panic and crash the value of the dollar to the point where $100B wouldn't be a big deal for him to pay out ^^/s. You think the value of the dollar rests on how good Amazon is doing? . > ^^/s  Jeff Bezos selling all his stock doesn't necessarily mean Amazon isn't doing well (could just mean he has to pay a $100B ransom, you know), but the value of the dollar rests on a combination of a lot of things, yes

People think of our planet as a rock solid ball.  It is in fact a loose pile of rocks saturated with water (crust) sitting on top of extremely viscous fluid (mantle) on top of fluid fluid of outer core. Only inner core is solid.  Also, contrary to the popular misconception, magma is not some liquid coming up from the deeps. It is solids from crust/mantle melting due to local stress and coming up. . Clever boy, its turtles all the way down. My god, it's full of elephants.. Only four, actually. I mean, there was five, but one fell off.. Yeah, the fifth elefant. His name was Badaboom or sth like that.. Big bada boom!. Get your multi-passes out everyone.

There will always be plenty of racists in America, and the GOP isnt actively waging war against education because they didnt like school.. Show me the racists in the Donald. You mean the subreddit that upvoted an Obama campaign poster with hope changed to rope and the caricature with him in a noose? The same subreddit supporting neo nazis in the Charlottesville riots, and are openly Islamophobic / xenophobic?   Golly, where are all the racists there it's so hard to find them . Again, show me the racists on the Donald. If I had to guess I'm responding to one. Oh what you mean is you cant. Because racism is against the TOS and that sub would have been banned long ago.

Your insipid and childish accusation is actually funny because I do more for impoverished minorities that you will ever do.. Lol you don't know anything about me, but to ignore the racists in that sub after what I just pointed out is pretty nieve of you in the best possible case scenario, and deliberately dishonest and misleading at worst
t3_7wkc3c	0	*	Treating mental illness could save global economy billions  and it's 'costless,' study says - The study estimated that for every $1 spent on treating depression, production would be restored by the equivalent of $2.5.. The corporation benefiting from the increased production is waiting for someone else to pay the $1, so they'll get $2.50 benefit rather than $1.50 benefit.. Wait, how did treating people suffering from mental illness become about corporations?   They are just putting a dollar figure on the benefits a an argument to the general public that more attention needs to be on this issue.. Cause corporations run the government.. So corporations rigged the election for both Obama and Trump? The corporations seem pretty erratic in their choice for President then >.>. Corporations dont own the government, they rent it. Once they have what they want they stop paying and another corporation comes in.. And I thought that it was a complicated issue! It's all the corporations fault! Them evil corporations! . Unless they are run by Elon Musk, trust me you dont want to talk shit about him on here.. So you guys must be communists right?

t3_7uqcrl	0	*	Reported sex offences against males in England and Wales up 200% - Reports of sexual offences against men and boys have risen by more than 200% in the past decade, figures show.. Is this because more offenses are happening, or because more men and boys are willing to speak up?  Hopefully it's the second.. The second, I'd bet my money on it. Same reason most women don't report it either, shame and fear.. Pretty much. Shame and the fear of not being taken seriously.  Though it should be noted that while females are more likely to have been raped overall, and both genders under-report it, male rape victims are less likely to report it to the police than female rape victims. At least in Australia.. [-NSFL- If you find the government collapsing to a coup odds are the Geneva convention has been thrown out of the window -NSFL-](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men). Jesus Christ. When will there be a #metoo movement for these victims? . metoo was for men as well. Plenty of my male friends joined in with publicly telling their own stories of harassment and abuse. If anyone told you otherwise, i.e. that it's for women only, then they were very wrong.. Quite a few men got torn apart for posting. Most women are accepting, but there are enough bad experiences going around to effectively shut men out.  An interesting thing I noticed during the metoo thing: some men *are* allowed to tell their stories..  if their abusers are also men. When women are the perpetrators the story gets no traction at all.. And omen got torn apart, too, before we reached a critical mass.  Im sorry, but you guys are going to have to muscle through the same pain we did on this one.  Theres a reason we hail the victims who come forward as brave.

Better make sure to change them back before we take back Washington.. Simple math says that democrats can't take congress if that's what you're implying.. That's objectively false, they can get a majority in both houses, though not a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. . The only things up in 2018 are basically all red areas.

The astonishing result comes from analysis of DNA extracted from 400 ancient remains across Europe.. A similar occurrence happened in Ireland and is talked about in Irish mythology. Ah do you mean the fir bolg and tuatha?. And the Formorians?. Fomorians were always there, first turning up in the Partolon section of Lebor Gabhala and fighting/raiding/ruling against every successive wave of settler.   The replacement of the inhabitants of Ireland came with the Gaels/Sons of Mxedl that replaced the Tuath Dxe9 Danann when they won the Second battle of Maigh Tuiread.. A Fomorian never misses out!. One legged shower of gowls.. I presume you're all talking about Slaine in 2000 AD?. No Slxe1ine took almost all of the material from Irish mythology. The Fomorians, warp spasms, book of invasions, Emain Macha..

t3_7xm87i	0	*	Government too politically correct to enforce rules on hijabs in schools, leaving teachers alone, isolated and vulnerable, former head of Ofsted has warned. Sir Michael Wilshaw said lack of formal policy...on whether children should be allowed to cover heads in lessons has led to angry clashes.. Vulnerable? What bullshit. How does a girl wearing a hijab threaten a teacher?. I think it's more to do with the fact that the consequences of getting the situation wrong is probably career ending.  Imagine if a teacher told a kid to take their hijab off to conform with uniform policy. That kid goes and tells their parents, who would probably lose their shit and feel their religion is being discriminated against. . And why again are we forcing kids to take off their hijab? This whole situation is absurd. . Why arent the schools allowing kids to wear whatever they want to school?  Why cant kids wear ripped jeans and a death metal band t-shirts?  The schools want the kids to all dress the same because they think it removes distractions and creates more unity because kids arent competing over who has the nicest clothes or teasing kids whose parents cant afford designer brands.. Oh please. No one is suggesting that allowing hijabs means erasing all dress code standards. But this is an important part of many peoples religion. It poses no burden on anyone to allow them, but a huge burden on Muslim kids to ban them. What is the point? Just to emphasize ones disapproval of Islam? To make a political point about immigration and assimilation? Its silly. And counterproductive. . Hijabs aren't religious, they are cultural. Nothing in Islam requires the hijab to be worn. It's not a burden on those kids at all.. The Quran very clearly says so in 24:31:  >and to wrap [a portion of] their **headcovers** over their chests  Also consensus has already been established on this issue. Simply because you disagree doesn't make it false. Literally 99% of Muslims think it's mandatory.... Agreement of the majority doesn't mean they are correct. See, and what you just quoted doesn't mandate wearing headcovers, it just talks about wrapping them around their chests. What 99% of hypocrites believe doesn't really matter, unless you happen to live somewhere where they make the rules.

They must felt pretty stupid right about now.. Blackholes don't bother me. Micro-black holes wouldn't be stable enough to exist long enough to do much harm.   It's just I don't trust humans with Death Rays.. # RODS FROM GOD. Those would be made of tungsten.. and, if we're being honest, probably already exist.

Unfortuntaly, its looking more and more likely that shit will remain fucked, and we'll be stuck with a cliffhanger until the end of time.... Wasn't there an announcement that they aren't working on HL3 anymore?. Not an official announcement but almost all of the original writers and other staff members are gone and Gabe has gone on record saying they weren't gonna work on it unless people working in the company really wanted to.. Tl;dr we realized making quality content and games wasn't as profitable as hats and l loot crates. You know very well they could have sold HL3 with cosmetic headcrabs that people would react to differently (with throw away 1 liners) and they would have made billions. . Yeah but they'd actually have to write and end to the story instead of just making cosmetic items for existing stories

I didn't believe you; then I found this: http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-howard-stern-princess-diana-671353. I just threw up in my mouth.  Trump is a terrible human being.. Yeah, he wanted to sleep with a beautiful woman. What a terrible human being.. So T_D posters defend incestuous comments now? Good grief, just when you think they can't stoop any lower.. I didnt realize Trump was related to Princess Diana?. Mobile reddit made it look like you were replying to the comment above you. But while we're on the subject, what do you think about trump's comments on how he'd date his daughter were she not his daughter?. Id be lying if I didnt say it was kinda fucked up.

Does it matter?. It should matter. It maybe a trivial detail to you but the fact that the POTUS can just lie so brazenly and the Trump supporters lap it up should scare all Americans to the bone. . It does. Anyone with half a brain knows that 99% of what comes out of Trumps mouth about anything political is nothing but pure lies and filth.

It's difficult to insult Saddiq out of context, pretty much anything bad you can say about him is valid in some way.. https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/1/9/enhanced/webdr14/original-9966-1462108187-3.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto  It's not that hard to insult him out of context, given that he faced the most overtly bigoted election campaign in recent decades.. I'm no fan of Goldsmith, but pointing out Labour's back-clapping, he's an okay guy really cuddling with extremist leaders and groups isn't bigoted. Irrelevant, maybe, but not bigoted.. If Trump met with Putin prior to an election people would lose their shit but when Sadiq cosies up to extremists and terrorists that's irrelevant.  Seriously can we make our mind up on guilty by asscociation because the hypocrisy is boring as fuck.. As far as I know Sadiq didnt meet anyone. The leader of his party did, and that was the premise I was working with.. He was also Nation of Islams defence lawyer, defending their leader who refers to Jews as blood suckers he worked as a human rights lawyer too defending multiple terrorist who all just happen to be Muslim.

So, not on topic, but is it confirmed that BOTW is in the Deafeated Hero timeline?. The gamemakers basically said In the BotW timeline, all of the other Zelda games can be considered to be more legends than history. Who's to say which ones actually happened and which were embelished or made up?  In the eyes of Breath of the Wild, it is in all timelines and no timeline.

All the road signs and markings in the US with distance/speed must be changed, some cars only display imperial units in their speedometers, etc.  For the US to switch to Metric you require an effort equal to the entirety of Western Europe switching to Imperial. It's too late by now, really.. The UKs road signs are still imperial even though we are only taught metric.

Guess what the last 2 C's stand for.. When has the US signed on to the unfccc?. Since it was first created. It's an Annex 1 Party.. Not ratified. . You're wrong, but that's beside the point.

Aka: capitalism. Sure, go ahead and move there and after a couple of years come back and make that argument. . A free market is not the same as a free country. .

How does any person in Afghanistan support the Taliban when they do things like this that kill hundreds of their own countrymen?  I mean you'd think the entire country would have turned on these people by now.. . The Taliban and their supporters view these people as collaborators.   Not an apologist; just the way they will spin it . Collaboration with...the elected government. . Exactly. Collaborating with who they view as the enemy.. They dont view the elected government as legitimate.  So to them, all casualties are worth it to drive out the usurpers.  . Because let's be honest many cases it isn't. The government is insanely corrupt over there. Like fuck the Taliban to death but the corruption in the government needs to be ended too. . At what point do you think that a corrupt government is somehow worse than a terrorist group that actively murders its own people?. The police openly kidnap and rape little boys, something the Taliban doesn't condone. The Taliban use it as an example of the corruption to recruit fighters. I think even we Americans can appreciate hatred of child molesters.  Now make the populace even less educated than the most backwater hick in the states, and you get extremists.

The reason they were blown up was because of praying. No, the reason they were blown up is because of extremist cunts. Thats like saying the people that died in 9-11 died because they went to work. . No it's nothing like your 9/11 analogy.  They're extremist cunts who blew themselves up in the name of Allah (religion/prayers).   I didn't mean it literally...  I just think it doesn't make sense to pray because that's the root of the problem.. No. Praying is not the issue. Religion is not the issue. Extremists are the issue. And they come from all religions. . yeah religion is the issue when it impacts people other than yourself (e.g homophobia, oppressing woman...).   You literally just said extremists are the issue, and they come from religions. . Extremists cons from religion, yes. But not all people who are religious are extremist.

Youre clearly not British, anything over a 3 is good enough reason to put the kettle on. . Did you know for a lot of people in the UK, namely up north, 'tea time' is actually your dinner.. Not just up north. . Also down North, too. Mainly midwest northshire. And Scotland.  Tea time, dinner and supper. I know they are all technically different but we use all three interchangeably.. There's supposed to be a difference between supper and dinner? They're exactly the same to me
t3_7y7ye1	1	*	Southern United Kingdom suffers 4.4 magnitude earthquake, causing panic in tens of old people and cats.. Sending thoughts of biscuits, and prayers for black tea and milk. . If you've got black tea then you've been brewing the wrong leaf.. Pretty much 90% of british teas i know of are all black teas. Highly oxidized teas are the british staple.. I never knew there was such a thing as a black tea as a former Brit of thirty years. To me, tea is brown and coffee is black. In the uk we just drink tea. Most of us don't get fancy about it. Builder's tea is the term. brown tea IS black tea. Its been allowed to basically ferment after being picked. Green tea is steamed to kill off the bacteria that cause it to ferment. Oolong varieties are partially fermented then steamed.  Red teas are a different tea plant.. Yes, sorry, I wasn't actually disagreeing with you but rather deferring to your superior knowledge. I'm just saying that we don't differentiate so much in the UK and that the idea of a tea that has made your cup literally black sounds rather ghastly. But today I learned! Teas have colours which aren't their actual colours! :). LOL. You are British.. This is indeed hilarious.

Throwing some shade on Tesla makes their clients happy.. Well, Tesla is currently spread way too thin to meet its production demands.  I'm not sure why people here defend Musk at every opportunity, he's a scam artist who attracts investments from stupid people with inherited family money.  He's essentially a slightly more successful Bernie Madoff.. To claim he is a scam artist is over the top.   He is producing things for people unlike the guy you compared to.  . > He is producing things for people  You do realize Madoff made a few 'investors' very, very rich?  He bilked most people out of their money, but some of his original investors made a fortune from him.. There are cheaper ways to do a Ponzi scheme than spending 100's of millions on factories and rockets.... Do you see the words 'Ponzi Scheme' anywhere that I've written?  I'm comparing the two people, they are scamming people in two completely different ways.. You compared Musk to Bernie Madoff earlier. Madoff worked ponzi schemes. So why did you compare Musk to Madoff if you think it is no ponzi scheme? . They are both excellent at convincing rich, dumb people to hand over money.

Fidel showed up in Canada for his funeral. People like to make the above joke because of it . The hard core Conservatives in Canada aren't joking about it though. They seriously tried to run with Trudeau is Castros illigitimate son  Look at Beecroft's post for example.   Canada' has it's share of morons too. . he does look a hell of a lot more like castro than his dad though. This is precisely why I give it any credibility at all. Sure, it could easily just be a coincidence. In fact, it probably is. But family genetics do play a large part in how a person ends up looking. Myself for instance, I look a lot like my mother in my child hood pictures. My father however starts to appear in my face as I get older.   Give it time people. Father Time tells no lies. . Its bunk because the supporting evidence is they look kinda similar and the evidence against it is When the Trudeau family first went to Cuba Justin was already 4 years old  So either Fidel is such a good lay that he gets you pregnant 5 years in the past, or its simply not the case.. I thought that Fidel visited Canada some time before Justin was born?  I could be totally wrong about that though, I only hear about it from the jokes on Reddit.

I don't know about bullshit news, but if you want to see a narrative pushed aggressively, take no further look than /r/politics. Idk mate i think TD takes the cake for that one. At least TD owns it. You know they're for Trump, it's in the name. R/politics is sneaky, because even with the neutral name, it's just as biased, but towards the left.. You cant remotely compare the magnitude of bias TD has to anything else. R/politics at least invites discussion. TD straight up bans anyone who doesnt whip their dick out for Donald. Its a constant parade of memes mixed with whatever conspiracy theories they can cook up.. r/politics invites discussion in their rules only, but try reasonably disagreeing with a headline's claim and see what happens.   T_D is very clearly a Trump-supporter-only subreddit. It's never claimed to be a sub for bipartisan discussion. Reddit is a left leaning website. If they left the sub open to majority rules, it would no longer be a pro-Trump subreddit.. I have disagreed with the sensationalist nature of more than one article in that sub. You're right they do this thing called disagreeing and that's totally ok with me. . Disagreeing as in downvoting you to -20 within five minutes and launching a variety of personal attacks in your direction? Trying writing a conservative comment over there, just as an experiment. Make it as mild-mannered as you want. See what happens.

So he wants Facebook to make people stop posting garbage? I think he's been hanging out with Trump too much.. Maybe he's thinking that Canada can just block FB.. so like what Communist China does?. Hate to pop your bubble... But calling it communist China isn't necessary anymore.   It is now the people's Republic of China, a sort of hybrid of authortairian socialism but it's mostly just another oligopoly full of corrupt capitalists just like the US. They are not much different from us anymore . They still have ridiculous restrictions aka the great firewall. Don't pretend they're just like the western world.. Never said they didn't, I was refuting the concept of communist China. Communism in China is dead, and it is now another capitalist state . > oligopoly full of corrupt capitalists  That's not capitalism. The kernel of capitalism is property rights. Violation of property rights is not capitalism. That's cronyism.

[Canada is more free then the United States](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index). No, it's not. And no shitty link can support it. . Alright bud. Your country with an enormous prison population, out of control police, and underwhelming press freedom is totally the freest country on earth because that's what they told you in an army commercial at a nascar game. Your country locks comedians up for jokes. . I'm not sure what you mean. Are you talking about the comedian who mocked a disabled 12 year old boy and was fined after his parents complained to the human rights commission? . Nice you brought that up, please justify that one. Checkmate. . An adult man harrassing a disabled 12 year old is pretty hard to justify. You can't harass people in Canada based on a disability, it's the same in the states. 
t3_7w9869	0	*	Justin Trudeau to Facebook: Fix your fake news problem  or else. I don't see any possible problem coming up with allowing the government to decide what news is real and legitimate, and what news is fake that needs fixing. None at all. That seems like a completely good idea. . Right... are we really living in a climate where this is a legitimately okay thing for a PM to say, 'hey we might restrict the access to information if you don't post information we agree with?' Wat. While it's a fair point that BS stories may get attention that is unwarranted, and mislead people, yes, the alternative of restricting information is MUCH worse, in my view. . I just God in an argument with someone in r/politics. Apparently Justin banned anyone from running for office if they were part of the same party he was in if they're pro life...and I said he that's not cool telling people what their views can be if they want to run for office, and people just went off on me.  I mean,imagine trump saying if you are pro choice, you can no longer run as a Republican. Pro choice vs anti choice isn't really a debate anymore for politics. That was settled a long time ago now. Wut that debate is ongoing. Maybe not for Canada, but for the US. It's a single issue for a lot of evangelicals here.. I was under the impression that this thread was about Canada.   That does suck that they are wound up over it still in some areas of the US. I can appreciate that our politics are different. . kind of sucks they have different views from us.

America interfers in foreign elections constantly . Please dont do the whataboutism thing.  Facebook needs to stop spreading Fake News and enabling Russian social propaganda campaigns in western democracies.  FACEBOOK NEEDS TO END ITS RUSSIA PROPAGANDA PROBLEM.. Just pretty hypocritical of Western leaders like Trudeau to denounce this kind of behavior but sure, Russian boogey man.. it makes me sad how many people are falling for that bullshit.  We fuck in foreign elections all the time as you said, but the second it *might* have happened to us, HOLY SHIT THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.  They're not the aggressors here. Like it's wrong of Russia to interfer, but the righteous indignation that people (like Trudeau) have about it just comes off so phoney and hypocritical.

I think we passed that point when we started electing reality tv stars to office. . trump isn't the problem. he's the effect of the problem. don't blame him. america has been fucked for at least 60 years. maybe even since the federal reserve.. I have no sympathy for Trump. He is not the only problem, but he is a problem. Everyone that voted for him is part of that problem. . democrats rigging the primaries isnt a bigger problem? that's a failed republic. trump got elected because the dnc decided to elect their own killary instead of listening to their voters. but ya, trump is the problem. just keep blaming trump while ignoring actual problems. . What if I told you theyre all problems? I know, fucking mind blowing right?
t3_7qd1iq	0	*	Uruguayan hostel says Israeli guests not welcome. How is generalizing Jews [or Israelis] and giving them a bad connotation any different, or any less racist, than generalizing blacks in the US?  Racism is never ok. I'm shocked that anyone can justify singling out an entire ethnic group like this! It's unacceptable . not jews ; post IDF tourists.. It says Israeli guests not welcome. Not IDF. Could I put up a sign on my shop window saying Africans not welcome, but really only be referring to gang members? I don't think so.  Somehow, the bar for what is counted as racist is lowered when it comes to dealing with Israelis/Jews. . don't pretend you don't understand which demographic is targeted... Israeli guests not welcome = perfectly acceptable.   Africans not welcome or Mexicans not welcome = racist.   I'm sorry, but no, I do not understand. I don't understand how racism of ANY nationality can be accepted. Regardless of what sub-cultures may be found within a particular nationality, it's NEVER right to single out an entire nation or ethnic group. . Stop playing dumb. I didn't really get it either.  Why is discrimination based on nationality ok?   Isn't it just as bigoted as discrimination by race? I don't really see a difference.. The point is that it is about a very specific target audience namely you Israelis who have just finished their military service because they are problematic. It's not really about nationality. If there was a specific word to define the target audience. they would've used that instead of israeli.

Title is a bit misleading.   > This keeps Palestinian mobile companies at a continued disadvantage, including in competition with Israeli companies that offer 3G and 4G coverage to Palestinian customers in the West Bank through towers installed in Israeli settlements.  . Inside Palestine this was was a well known Israeli-business oriented policy to force Palestinian consumers to purchase internet from Israeli cellular providers. . Except for the fact legally P.A. residents **can't** buy cellular packages from Israeli cellular providers.  So much for that nonsense.. That isn't actually true. Although the P.A. has administrative control, the Israeli military establishes the law. The P.A. can propose laws to the IDF, but the P.A. cannot pass any laws without the IDF's approval. Given that BDS is illegal in Israel, I highly doubt that the IDF would approve a pro-BDS bill put forward by the IDF.. 1) The P.A. has full control over the laws in Areas A + B.  2) This has nothing to with either the P.A. or COGAT.  You can't buy an Israeli cellular contract without an Israeli address.. Theyre only a little bit occupied  A little bit of oppression goes a long way.. > A little bit of oppression goes a long way.

They are vaccinating most of their children and it stops HPV which doesn't mean all possible cervical cancers.  EDIT: Or even all strains of HPV. Sure, but that'll still take care of about 91% of cervical cancers.. Are they vaccinating men, too? Does HPV cause testicle cancer? I dont think men can get cervical cancer.. Penile and anal cancer you mean. Yes, hpv is suspected to cause this but theres no test for men currently.. If they didnt make a test for men, then is this something men a required to do to protect women who don't get the vaccine then? Kind of like how we all donate to breast cancer research but not prostate cancer?. Even worse, straight and lesbian women are protected,  gay men are not.   if there was an aids vaccine and it was withheld specifically so that gay people keep dying in droves there'd be outrage, . Well I don't think not caring about funding or creating a test is a severe as withholding one that was created, but I get your point.. THe vaccine exists,  they just don't give it to guys, IT'S BEING WITHHELD. straight guys are protected by their female partners being vaccinated, gay guys aren't

UK does not have real NN  Providers currently offer packages that include spotify/netflix with no impact on data usage... . >UK does not have real NN  Yes it does.. That has nothing to do with ISPs charging more for certain access, offering Netflix or spotify as a service included in a package is not a legally regulated thing.. i don't think you know what he means, what he means is that your ISP can make it so certain things don't effect a data cap. You still have to make for netflix and spotify premium (however it can be included in a package) but ISPs can (and some do) make it so certin things dont impact your data cap.. They affect data caps, the fact is that a vast majority of people in the UK have no data caps. I'm 21 and I've never met a person with a data limit on their broadband, only on mobile phone plans. I currently have a phone contract that gives me a year of Spotify Premium for a year, and it still uses my mobile data allowance when I use it at work.. You've clearly never met anybody from Hull.. You are correct, I have not. Do people really have data caps on broadband?. A company called KCOM owns all the lines in Hull instead of BT so KCOM is basically your only option. KCOM have datacaps and ridiculous prices.. Well, my condolences to the people of Hull

You'd think a former apartheid state would know one when they see one.. they're full of shit. What is that? An appeal to popularity?  I think you'll find the popular opinion is that Israel *is* an apartheid state.  It might be uncomfortable for you, but there it is.  Simply stating 'they're full of shit' isn't going to change any minds.. Apartheid was one country where there were two sets of rules for the races.  The current situation is people who lost numerous wars that want their own country but will do nothing to help secure their borders because they throw their lot in with terrorists rather than making viable governments to push a peace process forward.  If they want to water down what apartheid was then thats fine. . Mandela was called a terrorist too.. How many stabbings did he reward?. Mandela initiated the shift within the ANC under Albert Luthuli from peaceful resistance to violent resistance. People died but it worked. Consequence of fighting for freedom. As such South Africa has great affinity with the people of Palestine who sought to help the ANC in-exile during Apartheid and who now see the Israelis of doing the same as here.

Yeah erase that perception of England. It's really not white power. Eastern europe is probably the most racist place.. > Eastern europe is probably the most racist place.  This one gets tricky.  Places like Poland often get accused of mass racism but that isn't always the case.  It can be hard to distinguish between hard line nationalism and racism when a population is largely homogeneous.  . Nationalism and racism are close bedfellows, especially when a population is homogeneous.  So no, I do not find it hard to distinguish.  Eastern Europeans are, by and large, quite racist.. don't shit talk countries you haven't been to. I havent been to Russia but I've been to enough other European places to know that the further east you go, the more racism you'll find.

Or Myanmar, with their current genocide going on, the great bastion of Muslim rights?. Huh. Do black people have less rights down here in the south?. You could certainly argue so considering the laws and suppression that specifically target them. Can you point one out?. Oh there is the constant confederate flag waving, murals to slave masters, high schools named after Robert E Lee  And the flagrant gerrymandering used to suppress the black vote..

I saw a request for an AMA a few hours ago, but I can't find any news about the actual event in any of my news outlets.. Ah, could probably have guessed. Though I should clarify that the decision they took was to *discuss* (and only in August) the possibly of nationalising all farmland in the coming years, with expropriation without compensation being a last resort in cases where sale is not possible or refused. . This is correct and should be noted by all. The news and /r/southafrica has been sensationalising it in a very different manner. This of course brings out all the lovely racists and trolls. .

The same dead rhetoric may be the same shit we've been saying since his election, but he's still a piece of shit and he's still a pathological liar.

t3_7yva0h	0	*	Donald Trump falsely says he never denied Russian meddling. Is this bullshit ever going to end?. It could end this week, if Congress wanted it to.. oh really? how so?. Impeachment proceedings.. and what would the charges be?. It can be whatever they want it to be.  High crimes and misdemeanors is left intentionally vague.  Impeachment is a political, not criminal, process.  The catch is that you need most of congress to be on board, which is politically difficult.  25th amendment could be invoked as well.. So no particular charges, am I right?. High crimes and misdemeanors is a particular charge Congress can make at its discretion.  What constitutes a high crime and/or misdemeanor is extremely open ended, by design.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors

t3_7yva0h	1	*	Donald Trump falsely says he never denied Russian meddling. He never has denied Russian meddling. He's just denied that he colluded with Russia. There's a difference.

Wrong.  http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-trump-says-putin-again-denies-meddling-1510408034-htmlstory.html. There Trump just says that Putin denies the meddling. Obama also believed that there wasn't any meddling before the election and then when he saw the result he changed his tune.. And he BELIEVES him! He could have said he iis full of shit. But did he? Nope. He believes him. . So at worst he's too trusting. But that doesn't make him guilty of any crime. And again Obama believed Putin too when he was president.. He's too trusting of Putin...he doesn't seem to trust the intelligence briefings he gets from his own agencies...  >And again Obama believed Putin too when he was president.  What? No he didn't. Provide a single source where Putin denied interfering and Obama said he believed him. where was the briefing on the kid who openly announced he was going to kill his classmates? . Do president's get briefings on every tip that is called in? I don't think it is reasonable or feasible to expect that. Also, I don't see what this has to do with anything...sounds like a weak deflection.

Sarah Suckabee Sanders took the easy path about that job: lie incessantly. Faced with overwhelming fact and proof that Trump is lying? Deny it, with a straight face, and blame (media, FBI, kids with cancer...whomever) something.. I wonder what the long term damage to her psyche is going to be like.. She's as much of a sociopath as her father and her brother (the one who was fired from his position as a Boy Scout camp counselor for his role in [torturing and/or killing a dog](https://www.snopes.com/politics/politicians/huckabeedog.asp)), the damage was done long ago.. Are we pre-judging folks based on the sins of the father and brother today? Tough to keep track sometimes.. No, we're performing a retrospective on a public official who lies for another liar.  She actually got a pretty fair shot when she started at her new position following the embarrassment to democracy that was Sean Spicer, but she ended up being somehow even worse.. same score for the 'good cop' that stand around while the 'bad cop' does X.

Yeah it was very confusing to learn that lots of Americans have it done.  Especially when theyre still children.. Upwards of 90%. I didn't have my son circumcised because of complications that I had from mine as a newborn. (They took too much) hell, taking any is taking too much but that's just my perspective . That's a bloated number. I've read 60-70%. It's gone down recently.  In the early '90s you would have been low-balling at 90%.. I was born in 88 and I went to catholic school and was on the swim team and water polo team. My brother and I were the only guys uncut out of like 40 guys on the swim team.. How do you know this?.

I cant stand porn with women who havent had plastic surgery to remove all that extra labia.. thats your own issue then.. No, I'm saying we should do that to babies. I wish it had been done to me as a baby so I wouldn't have to worry about it as an adult. /s. Wouldn't you end up with a super dirty vagina? . No, why would it? Less labia = less to clean.  . I just thought they actually served a purpose in helping keep dirt out unlike having forskin that doesn't have any cleanliness benefits. The things you know. . The foreskin protects the glans from dirt, dust, pollutants, etc. 
t3_7u9z72	1	*	Ban circumcision for boys under 18 says Intact Denmark. lmao, just having a circumsized penis on here is merit for getting downvoted.  I'm cut, had no choice about it, and I don't give a flying fuck about it.  I enjoy sex like everyone else just fine.  And I don't care what anyone else's penis looks like.  If they banned circumcision worldwide tomorrow, I wouldn't give a fuck.  Now lets tally up my downvotes.. Nobody is bothered by what you think of your own penis, only what you think should happen to infants. . It's common knowledge on Reddit that people tend to look down upon people who are cut.  This comment thread and posts previously about this topic are both evidence of this.  . No, cut people are just oversensitive about the practice of infant circumcision being criticised. . Honestly I haven't seen anyone being critical of that.  We are mostly just oversensitive of the fact that people are critical of the fact that we don't mind our penises and don't see ourselves as horribly mutilated monsters.  I'm all for not chopping up baby dicks.. People are critical of the argument I'm happy with my circumcised penis so I'm going to do the same to my kid regardless of what benefits there are. . To be honest, I've only ever saw one person say that and that was on this thread and posted out of spite.  . It tends to be the primary justification from what I've seen, although I paraphrased a bit. It's often the essence of what people who defend their choice are saying. 
t3_7u9z72	1	*	Ban circumcision for boys under 18 says Intact Denmark. yep.  let them make their own decision about permanent changes to their bodies.. Permanent cosmetic changes. Obviously, parents need to have say over medical decisions. The issue here revolves around the outdated, religiously founded idea that circumcision is medical, when it's really just cosmetic.   This is no different then a parent giving their kid a tattoo.. lol I didn't realize cutting a piece of you off was considered to be cosmetic. . Cosmetic as in cosmetic surgery.  That is, surgery not intended to treat an illness or injury.. > cosmetic   indeed, but still feels like a euphemism. Would you consider cutting off the tip of a pinky to be a cosmetic surgery just because it's not meant to treat injury or illness?. Yes, anything done to alter your appearance (which that would do) is cosmetic.  It isn't just relegated to pumping up your boobs or putting giant holes in your earlobes.. don't see how those are cosmetic either. Always thought cosmetic was like removing a mole. Any medically unnecessary surgery is cosmetic. 
t3_7u9z72	0	*	Ban circumcision for boys under 18 says Intact Denmark. Posts on circumcision always turn into huge debates.. Its such a hot button issue here.  Both sides have really valid points. I feel like the anti circumscision crowd wins out here on reddit but in the real world Ive anecdotally encountered the opposite. Lots of girls say uncut is gross and almost all guys who are say they will do it to their kids. But once again anecdotal. Ill probably still get downvoted. . It's kind of sad that it's seen that way in America.  It's kind of like guys who think labia are gross because all they ever see in porn are girls with innies or girls who've had labiaplasties done to cut them off.. Well.. I've never known any guy friends to turn down sex because of labias. I'm uncut and never had a girl say Whoa there.. nevermind.   . We may not turn down sex, but you wont be getting a second date if its too extreme . Someone won't get a second date if their foreskin is too 'extreme'?! That's one of the weirder things I've read on Reddit in while.. not foreskin, labia  and people are allowed to have their preferences, so its the same as a girl having big nipples or a big clit or her decision not to trim/shave.   If a deal breaker emerges once the clothes come off, why is it so surprising she won't be getting a second date?. I see...       I dunno, I don't think that many people would really be bothered, especially if the sex was good and they liked the person. Most people don't expect to meet someone who looks 100% perfect to them - and even if you did find that, over time their looks will change.

And as a preventive measure against masturbation... but he also advocated it as a punitive measure.. Oddly enough, that was also his idea for corn flakes.. I wonder if people know this isn't a joke . but it kinda is.  I'm cut, eat cornflakes and masturbate all the time.  He was a quack.. The cornflakes you eat aren't the cornflakes he invented.

If you'd agreed with them you could have always one it as an adult. . Yes, you're right, but in this context I'm glad they did it when I could not remember the pain of the procedure. . So if you'd been raped too you'd be ok with it since you wouldn't remember?. This is the second time Ive read this same comment from you. How do you compare rape to a procedure that is/was normal? Rape is not normal. A sadistic person rapes a child. A PARENT who decides whats best for their children using their judgement is not comparable in any way shape or form. Please stop comparing the two. It is a slap in the face to victims of child molestation.

Not an obsession as such, it is just something that there should be little debate about - get rid of it unless there is a genuine medical reason. Especially as we are pressuring third world countries to end female circumcision, it seems to be double standards.  It is the fact people keep backing it that keeps the debate going. . Why do you care that someone gets to have a better looking dick than you?  I sure as fuck don't remember any of the tramautic experiences of childbirth and am glad my circumcision was done at that time.. Because my dick is ugly and has reduced functionality because of a procedure which, if it had been delayed just a little, would have been medical malpractice. I want to protect other boys from that. . >reduced functionality  kek. The most sensitive part is whats left of the frenulum, and I can remember how sensitive my glans was when it was first cut.

t3_7u9z72	1	*	Ban circumcision for boys under 18 says Intact Denmark. My only concern is how it will impact the ancient and well-integrated Jewish community of Denmark unless religious exceptions exist. I understand why snipping infants' penises is bad, but I think that in some cases other rights must be considered, and it's imo very bad to go after model immigrants and likely drive them to Israel.. As a Jew, I don't see any problem. We should get with the times and stop letting old guys snip and suck on our penises before we are old enough to understand and consent.. As a Jew, I totally disagree with you. Don't preface your statement with As a Jew so you can express a contrarian opinion, because most of us disagree with you on that one.. The founder of the state of Israel Theodor Hertzl did not circumcise his children.. Theodor Hertzl was not the founder of the Israel. He simply was an important zionist and the person that modernized the Hebrew language. Though I don't see how he decided to parent is compelling in any way.. Well to him circumcision was a relic of the past.  Kind of in the same vein as killing heretics and stoning adulterers is to other religions.  . Ya, a lot like eating crackers and drinking wine is too for Catholics. I guess because religions and their practices are old we should stop doing all of them!!  .

Actually, the parks are funded by taxes, to the tune of approximately 500 mil/year. That said, a family pass for 136.40 or a single adult pass for 67.70 is kind of steep, even if it does give you access to all national parks for the year.. Depends how often you camp. 136.40 isn't bad when lots of campsites are $15 to $20 a night

Wait till we start giving them guns.  Just kidding! Haha! What kind of civilized country would ~~let~~ give minors ~~buy~~ easy access guns!. America sure doesn't, so who knows.. Not a handgun, but long guns? Yep, sure can. Rifles, shotguns, etc.  There are a few places where they can't, but its not prohibited overall. I'm not sure where that's the case, but I can see the logic. After all, long guns are used in under 3% of firearms deaths. It's less dangerous than giving your kid a car.. Fair enough. Though note that ~~most~~ about a third of accidental firearm deaths in the US involve teenagers and people in their early 20's.. Most of a minuscule number isn't a crisis.. Hundreds of deaths yearly due to accidental shootings is not a miniscule number.  Though I should clarify that after checking, it wasn't a majority, it was around 1/3rd who were under 25.
t3_811e2p	0	*	Canada Makes National Parks Permanently Free For Kids. It's not free if they have to be with their parents who have to pay. It's a discount.. But that goes without saying. Children should never be allowed to be alone.. ...really? *Never?*  In a national park, no.   But **never??**. They should always be carefully supervised, so they dont injure themselves.. Oh no, not a scraped knee!  Helicopter parents are a pestillence.. If infection sets in, it can be lethal.. Yeah, if you do absolutely *nothing.*  Infact, even if you did absolutely nothing, it still probably won't kill you.. I would hope most moral people would aspire to a higher standard of parental care than 'probably non-lethal.' The idea that we should not only fail to act to prevent injuries, but also deliberately refuse to treat them is barbaric. This anti-science, anti-medicine attitude is dangerous.

(If you want to go to any of the UK's National Parks, you just drive or walk onto them, spend as long as you want, and then leave.)  Is it the same in the US? Do you have to pay an entrance fee to Yellowstone?. User fees. You pay when you enter. Because in Canada the national parks are quite different in size and eco diversity than in the UK. Proper road and trail maintenance and protection for wildlife is necessary, among many other considerations. Your national parks are like our provincial parks where you just enter as you please. No offence. . Proper road and trail maintenance is [equally important](http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/students/wholooksafternationalparks/costsandspending) in the UK.  Our wide open spaces may not be as wide as yours but think a little bit before you make casually dismissive posts. Our national parks are paid for by taxation - because they are a resource for everybody.. Ill counter their point with the fact that our national parks in Australia are HUGE and we dont pay. . Everything from about 50 miles in from the coast is national park, right?. Even the coast in a lot of places . Sounds right.  I'd like to go there one day, but I don't think I'll make it.. Never say never! I dream daily of going somewhere else, wont happen any time soon but one day it will.

t3_7xbf5f	1	*	Chinas Strongest Weapon in a Trade War With Trump May Backfire. One thing that this article doesn't highlight is Brazil's role as a US competitor in global markets for animal feed and soy, as well as direct food supplies.  That is what China values most.  They need farmland and commodities to feed their population of almost 2 billion people. . I'm not sure it does neglect it.   >Last year, Chinas imports from Brazil rose 33 percent to about 51 million metric tons, while those from the U.S. fell 3.8 percent to 33 million tons.. Brazil has a very poor setup where to export, they have to send their agricultural products by semi-trucks to the coast for shipping, due to the mountainous geography they cant use trains/larger trucks. Every harvest they have traffic jams tens of miles long of these trucks. They wont be able to keep up with the demand if the Chinese cuts off those 33 million tons of US imports. China funds infrastructure projects in these countries to improve their export capabilities. . What are they gonna do? Blow up the mountains? lol It will still always be less efficient/more costly to truck your goods vs ship them in a large barge down the river as the US currently does.. >Blow up the mountains?   Sorta. You tunnel through the mountain and build railways through them for transport. . Valid point. This takes time though, time which China doesnt have if they want to cut off US supplies sooner than later. They literally did it in Pakistan, and it turned out to be quite successful. They're even expanding the tunnels,  and upgrading the infrastructure and road networ in Pakistan to accommodate the increased imports and exports.

t3_80vn4i	0	*	Violence against refugees in Germany drops dramatically. I understand the extreme right blaming Merkel for opening up the doors, but why is the left blaming her? Their explanation is for stirring up a fractious atmosphere in the country but in reality, she did what they wanted as well.. same reason Hitler is not considered a Socialist politician but got designated his own new category, because that wasn't real Socialism^tm.. To be fair socialist doctrine talks very little if at all about genociding the Jews.. no but the Marxist doctrine was used to rile up the masses against their capitalist overlords, aka the Jews; Hitler did call  hist party a socialist party at the time. and the government control over industry part is also quite Socialist.. TIL Nazi Germany was socialist, just like the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is democratic, what a world!  Its true because they called it that!. except democratic means a type of government run by the people, e.g. majority vote. where Socialist just means some type of government (public / cooperative) ownership and or control over economic forces.. Socialism is not government ownership of business or control over economics, by that rationale every government that has ever existed is socialist.. most of the current day societies are mixed economies, which are mostly capitalist, yet an organization like a central bank is not really private ownership. so you can put many modern day countries which have heavy regulations, central banks, government pension funds and government sanctioned monopolies in their own category.

From another user: Looking are wiki which have 2009 numbers here Bayer have around 50% of the market share and Syngenta around 25%  So this have very little to do with the US.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid. From that wikipedia  as of 2013, virtually all corn planted in the United States was treated with one of these two insecticides and various fungicides.[11] As of 2014, about a third of US soybean acreage was planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds, usually imidacloprid or thiamethoxam.. The point the user had was that around 75% of the market belongs to EU corporations.  And the decision was made by an EU court. Which means this has nothing to do with the U.S.  Though I suppose your point still stands. . I would like to see the US follow suit and ban the use of the insecticide. Sounds like there was an effort made in 2013, but I didn't see anything in the wiki about them completely banning it. . It's probably more along the lines of restriction rather than outright banning, though that's speculation on my part.

Anyone with moderate knowledge of tech can pick apart whole episodes  easily... Still good, though, and I highly recommend it regardless.. its a sci-fi drama/thriller show, not a tech show lol.. its like saying LOTR or SW is shit because it has logical flaws and the tech is dumb and unrealistic.. And then Star Wars isn't even Sci-fi, genres are hard.

Pretty much there is no logical reason why the current marketed gmos would cause problems to either. . GMO is such a broad term it's almost meaningless on its own. I mean, a dog is technically a genetically modified organism derived from wolves. It just took much longer.   The only real issue I have with them is from the business end, with farmers being beholden to corporations to only use their trademarked plants. . Farmers do not have to use their PATENTED plants, they can purchase from other people.. They do when companies like Monsanto literally buy up the entire seed market.  The problem has never been with GMOs themselves, it's with the predatory practices of the agro-chem companies.

I think the generally accepted belief is that the King or Queen has the right to override any law they wish, provided they never actually try to do so.  In law, you're absolutely right. In practice, unless there's seriously overwhelming public rejection of the law in question, the monarchy would have started the countdown to its own removal.

The capacity for the desal plants is 7million litres/day each. The consumption is around 600million litres/day for the city. The temporary desal plant produces 2 million litres of water per day. The math is pretty simple, but also consider how much energy requirements and infrastructure requirements increase with the new plants (because more energy is required to produce the drinkable water). . I'm not saying they are solutions to the problem, just pointing out that they are being built.. My point was that maybe someone like Musk could fasttrack R&D towards more efficient desalination technology. Kind of like his Boring Company. They're not reinventing the wheel. Nothing new about tunneling, they're just making it better. Someone needs to be doing the same for desalination, because more and more places will be needing it in the near future.. Elon Musk is already in so many projects, the man can only do so much.. Don't be so sure. He must be pretty great at delegation to get where he is today.

After that the cult was primarily expanded in prison systems. . Theres an episode of a podcast called The Dollop that explains this whole insane story (episode #9 The Pendragon).

Lol I'm pretty sure that's not a thing (It would take too much concentration on the audience's part). I'm assuming that they're referring to clapping on the 1st and 3rd beat of a measure instead of the standard 2 and 4 when the snare usually hits.

Theres a big difference between might have roots and traceable lineage which almost all monarchs in UK history actually have  Edit: my bad for not putting a link in here.

Who the fuck are these entitled asshats?. That's one perspective on it. Here's another.  The US gives aid to Palestine, but much ***much*** more aid to their occupiers Israel. Then the US says in order to continue recieving aid you must attend peace talks where you agree to stop defending yourself from invasion and give legitimacy to your occupiers.. Isreal doesnt support international terrorism and pay people's families for life for killing jews. One isnt like the other.. I would call recruiting and funding settlers to invade Palistine and set up settlements contrary to international law supporting international terrorism.. Well maybe it the PA wasent buying 50 million dollar private jets and spending millions on weapons and terror payments they could afford to better the lives of the actual people who live there.  Its almost like they want their people destitute so they can blame it on someone else.. And if the French Resistance didn't spend money on weapons they could have provided a better life for the French people under Nazi rule.  What's your point?. The PA isn't an underground group. It is the government in control of half of the West Bank. The Oslo Accords divided the West Bank between Israeli and PA control.  The PA should be developing their territory, not celebrating and rewarding terrorists.. The PA should be defending itself against invasion.  > The PA isn't an underground group.

The reality is many Americans want this and the rest don't give enough a fuck to do a god damned thing.. Yea other countries marching in the streets will surely change things in the US and won't be a completely useless gesture . For once, the argument for guns has some justification to it.

The environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit heat, noise, particulates, and gases which contribute to climate change and global dimming. Airplanes emit particles and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, lead, and black carbon which interact among themselves and with the atmosphere.

Cars are shorter, but more frequent trips. One 10K trip by air, vs 250 days of 50 km trips.

Techically, just the majority of Americans who voted. Our voter turnout is fucking abysmal.. It was't the majority, not even the plurality is just that the US's electoral system is completly retarded and you can somehow win an election with 3 million less votes than the second place.. It isnt retarded. How is it fair to the rest of the country if 5 cities control who is president. It is there to make sure all the regions of America are represented or well get another secession.. Because your vote should not count more just because you have more land. . Who is talking about land ownership?. Urbanites live close together on small pieces of land. Ruralites live far apart on large pieces of land. This should not grant them greater voting power but it does. 
t3_81848d	1	*	Trump says hell impose a 25 per cent steel tariff, which could decimate Canadas industry. Bush did a similar thing in 2002, 200,000 jobs where lost.   Had no choice but to lift them in 2003.. I remember this. Steel construction ground to a halt. Alot of small welding businesses went under. steel manufacturing took a huge nosedive in america during this too.. Why? Wouldn't this make us steel attractive?. if i buy steel right now for $5 and tomorrow i have to pay $10 for US steel or $15 for foreign steel, US steel is more attractive but i may not be willing or able to buy at $10 so i either go out of business or i start importing pre made foreign goods, cutting US steel out completely. . Or you manufacture elsewhere for $2.50 more, now have a price of $7.50, still don't pay $10, but that $2.50 of local wages is paid overseas.  Exactly as you are saying.  And then on top of that, we get retalitory tarrifs so items we make here cost more to ship overseas. . this is exactly why trade wars in the modern day are lose lose situations. the world is too interconnected to play protectionist now a days.. this is a lose lose win situation. the winners are countries we've imposed sanctions on with the help of allies these tariffs hurt. 
t3_81848d	1	*	Trump says hell impose a 25 per cent steel tariff, which could decimate Canadas industry. If the US had capacity to manufacture the additional steel within that price margin, this might work for creating jobs. But we outsourced so much of our steel production decades ago that this just amounts to a sales tax, because there is no domestic industry to pick up the slack. . Not to mention this just artificially raises steel prices for a bunch of infrastructure projects for the states. So considering he ran on improvements to infrastructure in his campaign, this feels like he's just shooting himself in the foot here.. Or increasing the margins of the insfrasture contractors he's quietly invested in over the last year.. What the fuck are you talking about?   If Trumps plan was to try and make money by investing in contractors who win bids on massive infrastructure jobs initiated by Trump he wouldnt need to impose steel tariffs to do that.  Please explain how imposing steel tariffs would increase the profit margins of the companies doing the infrastructure work.. Trump doesnt think things through.  He shoots from the hip in the dark because somebody on the internet said there was a noise.  Generally.. Whats your point?   I dont see how this has anything to do with what I said.. Meaning, we're trying to find some twisted logic behind this madman's bullshit.

The USA suffers less than Canada, so that is a win for the USA.. But they wouldn't, US relies heavily on raw exports from Canada like wood, water, electricity and oil. So he will try to spin it like we are suffering more but only the Murdoch empire viewers will believe it because they can't take their heads out of their asses long enough to get an actual news source. Nope.   Canada benefits more from Nafta than the USA does. . Uhh nope  Canada had a trade deficit with the USA so you benefit more. But you also need our raw materials more than we need your finished product. Both sides would suffer but the states bordering Ontario and Quebec would suffer more than anyone. Nope.   Canada does more trade with the USA than the USA does with Canada. Canada needs America. If Canada leaves, the USA will do just fine. It is just a fact.

It's also conjecture, what China *might* do.. Tell me more?  Edit: Silly me for my glib questions. I'm specifically looking for more information about these supposed threats. I understand why they would be done. I want to know when they happened/will happen and who said so.. China wants to target things that are econimically important in US leaders electoral regions. Putting econimic pressure on those regions upsets and hurts the populace. Unhappy people are less likely to re-elect someone and political opponents can blame them for the hardships.    By threatening Mcconnel and Ryan China hopes to manipulate their power in Congress and cancel the tariffs.. If the citizens of McConnell and Ryans districts haven't voted them out for all the shit they've pulled over the years by now, nothing is going to change their minds.  They'll happily keep voting for them all the while blaming Obummer and Butterymails as the bank is foreclosing on their homes.. Wisconsonite checking in... we try, we really TRY to vote out these idiots, but sometimes it falls apart. The Scott Walker fiasco was a huge money-waste in the end..

The markets reacted so violently today because of the threat of a trade war. . Who said the EU will impose tariffs?. The EU did. . I thought the EU was a governing body, not a human being capable of speaking. Is there a press release? An interview with an official? Direct quote from the office of someone important?  Or is it just (totally reasonable) speculation by news agencies?
t3_81848d	0	*	Trump says hell impose a 25 per cent steel tariff, which could decimate Canadas industry. Trump, if you keep fucking with Canada... Lmao what Trudeau is gonna cry about it?. You haven't visited the White House and seen the scorch marks, have you?. The ones from the brits? Who are now little more than Americas pet.. Check your history, Canada burned it down. Canada was British then. . Being British and being under British alliance is two different thing!  Do you really think that we wanted to give up our religion and pledge alliance to the queen of our former enemies and victor? Heck no, that's why lower Canada has been a shitshow for the English ever since; we always complained about the way the English treated us.. How Canadian of you, whine and complain instead of fighting for your freedom.

Putting econimic pressure on those regions upsets and hurts the populace. Unhappy people are less likely to re-elect someone and political opponents can blame them for the hardships.    By threatening Mcconnel and Ryan China hopes to manipulate their power in Congress and cancel the tariffs.. If the citizens of McConnell and Ryans districts haven't voted them out for all the shit they've pulled over the years by now, nothing is going to change their minds.  They'll happily keep voting for them all the while blaming Obummer and Butterymails as the bank is foreclosing on their homes.. Wisconsonite checking in... we try, we really TRY to vote out these idiots, but sometimes it falls apart. The Scott Walker fiasco was a huge money-waste in the end.. Yes, the Democrats propping up all those John Doe investigation was a money waste

Combined with the 30% tariff on solar panels (which is already losing us jobs) countries will retaliate.. Canada has one of the largest aluminum companies and produces quite a lot of it...that's a very stupid move.. Sounds like someone is specifically targeting Canada. Who wants Canada to be pissed at USA? Well, Russia for one.. Hope to God you forgot the /s tag and are not really that stupid.. Considering the US imports a lot of Russian steel its not crazy to think Russian influence is involved. Maybe not an influence to make Canada made at the US, but one where Russia gets a more than favorable deal.. Someone REALLY needs to translate Dugin's Foundations into English for the people who don't think Russia is doing *exactly* what everybody says they're doing.

It provokes trade wars.  . 50% of US steel exports go to Canada, so it's not like they wouldn't feel it if we went tit for tat here... In the end nobody wins.. China wins. Who do you think both Canada and the USA trade with the most, not counting each other? China is going to pick up some discount contracts.. Lots of bid out US contracts specifically refuse Chinese steel because its such crap quality. I don't see that changing, more likely that cost is just passed on to the consumer.. I don't know what gives people this idea that Chinese quality products are inherently bad. China makes some of the most quality products out there, they just choose to send out the lowest quality stuff when not specified or making enough profit. Have you considered the fact the people who have that idea buy the lowest quality Chinese stuff, create an informed opinion based on their experiences, and don't care enough to find out if China is keeping the best for itself?. Probably while typing it all out on their phone or computer...

I imagine Iraq isn't going to go through the years of appeals that make this true in the U.S. .

Death sentence for killing people still is the most ironic punishment there is. . Most appropriate I would say. . And rape for raping?. That's  not a valid comparison. The reason we execute terrorists is because they are deemed too  dangerous to be kept alive. . I like this explanation, it's not like we as a society operate on an eye for an eye basis.. And a rapist can be rehabilitated. Maybe they were heavily intoxicated when they raped someone and it's  something that is very likely to not happen again.   However terrorists make conscious  decisions to blow people up and to destroy in the name of a Sky fairy. There's  no coming back from that level of hate, insanity, and violence. They don't  even deserve a second chance. . People do come back from that level of insanity though - [Maajid Nawaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maajid_Nawaz) for example.

Also, all of germany became temporarily crazy too.  . Why couldn't he be a diabolical genocidal dictator who's crazy. . You are giving cover to next Hitler or next Stalin if you simply explain them away as crazy.  The Holocaust was not a crime of passion. It was premeditated Genocide. . OR it's understanding how people became crazy and stopping THAT before it occurs again. . Yes yes, we all know your plan.  Figure out which political or ethnic minorities have a predisposition for crazy(crazy can be anything, even the opposition of genocide can be deemed as a sign of crazy if the majority deems it so) and you put them into camps to separate them from the general populace.

Cutting branches, sugarcane and trees and jungle flora And cracking coconuts and other things? I had a machete growing up. It's just a tool .

Tbh its better than just kicking them out isnt it? . So if we did this with Mexican Migrants or Latin Migrants you'd be cool with it? . No why the fuck would they get money for being here illegally?. $4k per is probably a pretty good deal, as long as the door gets shut behind them.. So they can cross the border and make 4 grand? Nah. If there's no more coming in after we BUILD THE WALL, that would be a pretty good price!. Nah, the exchange rate is too high. Give em like $800 that's like $4,000 in Mexico . $800?  Senor, I wouldn't get out OF BED for $800!  $800 is an INSULT!  $3,500, and that's my final offer.  I'm absolutely taking a loss on this deportation at that price, but since I can see you are an honest man, a man of discernment, I will make this one last, and might I say VERY generous proposal, even after your lowball which would shock the conscience of every right thinking person.

Right - forced military service for life in an unending war between despots is totally acceptable and not grounds for refugee status. By virtue of your birthplace, death and violence is your future. Sorry guys.. Well, if you choose to look only on those parameters , it's kinda the same for Israelis , mandatory military service with years of reserved service (for some 30+ days each year until the age of 40 or 45 for officers). Unending conflict with no end in sight.. Conscription is only for Jewish men and women. Christians, Muslims, ultra Orthodox Jews are not required . Wrong, non Arab Christians , Circassians Muslims , Druze Arabs have mandatory military service by law. A growing number of Christian Arabs and Beduin Arabs volunteer for military service. As for the Orthodox Jews , some do serve , but it's a constant reason for inner clashes in our society. This issue bounced back and forth to the supreme Court for being unequal in regards to civil rights. . My GF had told me it was only Jews but Arabs could volunteer- she was in the IDF now an Israeli-American . Incorrect, served myself in the IDF with 2 Muslim Arabs , 6 Druze , 2 Muslim circassians and 1 Christian Arab all in one unit. It's not a state secret you can Google it.. Were the non-Jews conscripted or volunteers?

May as well say the US is deporting them considering that's where their money comes from . That's stupid.. Because it's wrong. The vast majority of the money given to Israel is in the form of discounts on military equipment.. Either way, given or discounted or however you want to spin it, Israel has more money to spend on things like deporting immigrants because of the US.   I'm not saying whether or not it's a good or bad thing, but it is a thing. . It's not spin .. that's what happens. Spinning would be saying we give Israel millions of dollars!.

You need to expand on that, because it's pretty bold statement. I assume that's sarcasm, because anyone with a brain would rather raise their kid in a wealthier, more educated first world society that values individuals and isn't governed by a completely corrupt pile of shit who runs a kleptocracy and whose people are dead in their 50s because of rampant alcohol abuse.

I'm not judging individuals, I'm judging a society that is capable, but unwilling to end support for practices that they disagree with.

Their sole and only purpose on this planet is to live, get fat, and then feed us.  They do not have emotions.  They do not have a soul.  Raise them, slaughter them, bacon.  . as much as I disagree with everything you've said, it's the right attitude to have if you're going to eat meat. None of this Oh I eat meat but I can't handle animal cruelty bullshit. . Well I'll tell you what, I eat meat from local ranchers which I've worked with and there is 0 cruelty there. Stop with the whole eating meat is animal abuse/cruelty vegan bullshit. We slaughter them but there's no cruelty at all! Lol okay. . Yea because there's no way to possible kill animals in a humane manner.  Keep fighting your worthless fight I guess . Haha that is exactly what I'm saying, pretty simple concept.   Carry on doing insane mental gymnastics on a daily basis to convince yourself that you don't contribute to animal suffering. . Aight fam, I'll let you know how my Bacon Parmesan burgers I'm making to grill up later this afternoon turn out  Peace. What a thought provoking reply! Careful not to cut yourself on that edge!

I'll never understand how it's so often considered radical to not want to support this horrific shit. . Yeah. To me, seeing this, veganism seems like common sense. You can't regularly consume meat and dairy without contributing to factory farming, even if you try to be careful, it's how the industry is. And I don't think it's morally acceptable. So common sense says this is how I need to eat and live.. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's definitely a middle ground between this article and veganism.. I actually think you are going out on a limb with that one. I think if you regularly eat meat, you are undoubtedly eating animals that have been treated this horribly. Factory farming is the norm, not the exception and, and AG gag laws are there for a reason . I eat meat daily from a family farm or from hunting. I refuse to buy meat for this reason. there is definitely middle ground . I don't want to find a middle ground on this anymore than I want to occupy the centrist position when it comes to segregation and civil liberties.   Killing them the nice way still ends their lives and affects all of the other animals in their group. . I guess we'll never agree here. I'd eat a human being in the right conditions so I don't think I'll ever have a problem eating an animal that was raised well. Show me a pig with the intelligence of an adult human and maybe I can agree they get a break, but I don't have a problem killing for food, especially if I'm doing it myself . > Show me a pig with the intelligence of an adult human  I mean, that's really not hard. There are thousands of profoundly intellectually impaired adults in the US that have the mental capacity of typical 3 year old, just like typical adult pigs do. If intelligence were the only metric for slaughter our meat supply would look mighty different.

Yes. Think of it more a protective law of politicians lobbying money they get from animal abusers . Welcome to America. There's also a law in the state of Wisconsin that it is illegal to ban plastic bags anywhere in the state.. That's why you charge .25 cents for each bag. No law against that. Seattle does this and I was more than happy to not buy a bag, it's a good alternative until we can ban them legally.. Yes, I live in Seattle actually! We actually banned plastic bags, and charge of nickel per paper bag.  Disposable bag usage went down by 85%. Huge win. We also banned styrofoam containers!. I love that city so much. I had no idea about the styrofoam ban. Good on them. I hope to live there one day, or at least somewhere close to it.

Are you sure it's just straight up illegal? I thought it was just illegal without the owner's permission.. So... illegal.. I understand what you're saying and can't argue with it, but where's the incentive to let someone film your barns/lots? Nothing to gain, only can lose. We've had news crews out to our farm in the past to film us loading hogs, so it's not completely uncommon.. There isn't one, but we still need to have it. The same way there's no incentive for a child abuser to vote for more Child Protective Services funding.

Yes of course, I don't base morals of empathy, that would be very dumb. Um, okay. Whatever floats your boat.. ? You do? So if you find Jews disgusting you would be okay with gassing them?. Empathy permits me to acknowledge folks of Jewish heritage as complex human beings, so I would never find Jews disgusting in the first place. Your analogy is confusing at best.

We are still ahead in science overall. China has a long way to go before it matches the US in quality science publications. Name one revolutionary technology invented in China. Things like paper and gunpowder cone to mind, not the internet and space travel, nuclear power, organ transplants, etc.. Look at author names on any scientific faper. Even if it's published out of a US university, it's Wing Wong this and Masala Ananda that. Take an intro STEM class and tell me if your TA can speak english worth a damn. . Totally irrelevant.. Completely relevant. All the best talents come to the US. If it wasn't for them, this country would be missing a giant chunk of innovators. . You're absolutely right. Still not relevant!. When the best of the best work in the US, you get a bunch of second rates left in the country of origin. . My argument was that the US has the best science output. I agree it's because they attract the best foreign talent.

Ah, yes, there is the protectionism(http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Protectionism_(Civ5)) in the commerce social policy tree. And it gives a extra +2 happiness for each luxury resource. I don't understand its logic though.  . No luxury resources traded out of the country = more luxury resources for your own population maybe?

EDIT: I am the dead man in /u/Brossarian's tent.. u/Brossarian is right. Mercantalism in Civ 4 was a civic that cut off foreign trade routes, iirc in exchange for free specialists.

Apparently condoms are more evil than AIDS itself (pseudo-science).. Theyve never said that? Come on bud - theres nothing wrong with disagreeing with how the church functions or handles certain things, but lets not make stuff up to push a point that doesnt have any basis in reality.   Im no fan of a number of things the church has done, but theyre all things the church has *actually* has a hand in. . The church right now is assisting in the proliferation of aids in Africa by claiming that condom use is immoral. They claim that sex without the intent to procreate is sinful.  Its not secret that the church is opposed to any and all forms of birth control. . Thats a disingenuously I complete picture of the situation, and its frustrating that youre pushing this belief with 25% of the story.

Also, how in the name of sweet and sour Jesus does Trump represent Christian values?. Because Hillary was ok with abortion and gay marriage and Trump is most likely against it.. Gay marriage isn't part of the ten commandments\*, but you know what is? Adultery, bearing false witness, stealing, and being covetous. All things Trump has verifiably done.  \* Not getting into the abortion/murder debate so I'll just let you have that one.. Only Jews adhere to the 10 commandments only.. So?

The State Department has been crippled by the Trump administration. Its absolutely shameful and should be a much bigger controversy... unfortunately there are so many competing scandals a lot of important issues arent able to get the attention they deserve. . Unless I misunderstand, the State Department regulates real diplomats getting in and out of the country legally, and the CIA regulates unregistered spies getting in and out of the country illegally.. Actually the FBI is in charge of counter espionage on US soil. . So what you're saying is that no redditors know anything about what they're talking about?. Hey hey hey hey hey... C'mon now, we've stopped at least one carbon monoxide poisoning case, what more do you want?. I want you to take a close look at this backpack.

t3_7sv0bk	1	*	French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to shut all of his countrys coal-fired power plants by 2021. We've also decided to make France a model in the fight against climate change, Mr Macron said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.. Pledging to shut them down is stupid grandstanding. Planning to shut them down is a laudable goal. Unless he has a magic wand.. It's pretty easy for him to do actually.. If he doesn't mind a lot of people going without electricity or paying much higher rates.. Why would people go without electricity because of him shutting down coal plants?. Got to replace them. Takes time and money. Permitting process alone, even for wind or solar, might push past his boastful deadline.. You're aware that fossil fuels are largely unimportant in France, right?  Most of energy production is nuclear. After that, renewables account for about 18%. Coal is about 1%.  So why would people go without electricity because he phases out and replaces 1% of energy sources?. Last year fossil fuels generated about 10% of French electric power, partly due to maintenance requirement on Nuclear plants. With a population of about 67 million, that 10% equate to about 670,000 people. I hope his magic wand is charged up.  Renewables account for less than fossil fuel at present. . >Renewables account for less than fossil fuel at present  I highly doubt that, not when it comes to energy production no. Keep in mind that actual consumption varies and comes from more diverse sources, as France is hooked on the European infrastructure. But renewables (wind, solar, hydro + biofuels) are definitely producing more energy in France than fossil fuel.

Then, the conservative government along with global corporatism will decide exactly what extremism is.   The noose begins to tighten on freedom, to keep us safe...of course.. To be fair extremism has been defined well for some time now, and tech corps should be regulated better and held accountable more. So I agree with this, especially if lives are saved. Out of curiosity, what is it defined as?. Content that preaches violence to innocent human beings, usually religious content. It really isn't that hard to define.. Jesus you are dense, can you read between the lines at all? Or are you just a tool shed? . Love it when someone replies with an insult because I know that the argument is already won. You are concerned that the Tory government will abuse the privilege in certain scenarios.

Even if Russia was the one supporting Egypt with such aid Egypt still wouldn't bother Israel considering history plus it being an major American Ally means Egypt would disappear if it started another war.. >Not quite it's to keep the military dictatorship under American influence  Why do we need influence there besides for keeping Israel secure? For the canal? We pay tolls for that already.   >Even if Russia was the one supporting Egypt with such aid Egypt still wouldn't bother Israel considering history   Considering that Israel started every war in their history that's complete bullshit. . We originally brokered that deal in the Camp David Accords to stop Egypt and Israel from getting into anymore wars with each other because the most recent one resulted in an Arab oil embargo on the US which we don't want to happen again. The situation is different now, granted, but that was the original logic.. Israel being in the Sinai is what caused that though, to be clear. . That may have been the cause, but US leadership still had an understandable desire to reduce conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors to avoid future oil embargoes.. But as you alluded, that risk has been mitigated by others means. 
t3_7rproz	1	*	Universal healthcare coverage law approved in Egypt. I'd like to know how Trumpsters defend even a shithole country like Eqypt having better healthcare than the US.  . Does this mean that the care itself is better? Not necessarily. . Better in terms of outcomes, probably not. Better in terms of accessibility, yes.. > Better in terms of accessibility, yes.  is it? just because its free doesnt mean they have enough facilities to reach everyone. you might evade getting in crippling dept but it still would be nearly impossible to reach treatment.  EDIT: a word.  The same can be said of America.. how? the usa is in a much higher place than egypt. . America doens't have enough facilities to reach everyone, and you can struggle to get treatment.. true but thats irrelevant to the starting point.   usa has a horrible system but its still more accessible and better (even if you get in crippling dept) than egypts.

Why did you bring up the military budget as if they have anything to do with each other.   Why would I flip my position?  How do you know my family hasn't been affected in that way?  What makes you think my family doesn't have insurance?

I am pretty sure those Chinese students pay for the (hefty) education overseas themselves, and in fact, supports the very livelihood of US and European universities....so ... maybe you shouldn't bite the hands that feed you (well, not you, personally of course).

My comment was a real question. $38B is a drop in the bucket, but the sarcastic tone it was delivered in suggests that meh, who cares. We have to start somewhere.. 38 Billion would fund almost four border walls. Not a small chunk of change. The national deficit is enormous.

They are not, commissioned in 1775 by the Continental Congress, Marines were maritime fighters pulled from volunteers and sailors. Unless you also think sailors are soldiers.. So what you are saying is that Obama purposely called the Marine Corps soldiers in a purposeful derogatory statement.   Matter of fact- I dont see any articles alluding to that statement .  Maybe post a source to this disparaging speech against the Marine corps.    . Well you win, I cannot find an article directly proving that President Obama has ever called a Marine by the incorrect title before. Please enjoy your victory.  Still my point is valid, where is the proof he lied? I am willing to concede when I cannot find evidence to back up my claims, are you?. Im just saying- once a liar , always a liar.   He lied about calling the president of the Virgin Islands.  So until its proven that it was indeed and accident- one can only believe that this too is a lie   And yes . Have you ever told a lie?. Yes- but not as a leader of the US to the people of the US who could easily de-bunk my fictional claim.

You point out the typical anonymous sources allegedly say and you get downvoted. That's not even the case this time. It's from a public record call made in 2017.

Why does anyone need to burn a Quran other than to send a message of hate to Muslims? I personally hate Christians, but I don't go around burning the New Testament.. What about burning the flag? Wouldn't that send a message of hating everyone from that country?  If burning the Quran is hate speech, then burning a flag is hate speech and also treason, probably  Wait, now that I think about it, are you even allowed to burn a flag in UK? It wouldn't surprise me if that was illegal too

Don't forget conservative radio stations. They're much more extreme than they were back in the early to mid 80s. Rural people especially love to listen to those stations.

Telling someone do this or I won't come is a demand. . Yes. But is he damanding she *ban protesting?* No. He is asking her to secure a warm welcome. Knowing Trump, this probably means a safe arrival and no traffic problems, along with a chance to talk to fans (he has an ego) to go from that to he wants to ban protests is not only a huge leap of logic, its downright libel.. >May responded to say such treatment was simply the way the British press operate, and there wasnt much she could do.

Interpreting the quote the same way May and her advisers did is not libelous. . That is not what is actually being said there. You are the one interpreting this as ban protests.

It applies to almost all goods sold in the EU. It doesn't matter where the goods came from, VAT will be applied. It's not like a tariff because it applies to all goods, not just imported ones. Therefore VAT doesn't encourage people to choose local over imported goods.. Does it not raise the cost of the good being purchased that are imported? In in doing it makes imported good more costing due to shipping expenses and other cost to export and import?. It makes all goods more expensive, imported or not, by the same amount. If an imported good costs more than a local good due to shipping then it would still have been more expensive without VAT.. I can see that but as compared to fair trade. Europe taxes our goods but we do not tax their goods. Europe has as mentioned by others use tariffs against China on steel. I understand the VAT is needed for government expenses. The benefit European countries have is exporting to none VAT countries seems clear. . How do European countries have an advantage because of VAT? Vat just makes everything in Europe more expensive, it doesn't factor into imports/exports.

t3_7vzv86	1	*	Russians successfully hacked into U.S. voter systems, says official. Can we start with voter ID laws. If you can't even get it right in your own country how do you expect to stop Russia.. sure voter ID that is done right, not done in the way the right wants to do things that ends up hurting those that vote democrat.. Has nothing to do with right or left. Why should someone that is not an American citizen cancel out you or my vote. More importantly how do you regulate someone without identification from voting multiple times. The list goes on and on.. well i dont get a vote since i'm not american thankfully, but why should the votes of thousands be cancelled out by the GOP because they would dare vote against the GOP. Until the GOP stops using voting laws to make sure they prevent Democrats from voting they can go fuck themselves.. You need ID for almost everything in this country. Why shouldn't one of the most important things in this country not require it? You act like every non American would vote 100% Democrat. Is there a reason you think this? Why is not having identification just a Democrat problem? . oh wow this talking point again. Its the ways the right tries to make it harder for Democrats to get the IDs they are willing to take for Voter Id that are the issue. Or did you miss the North Carolina thing where the right targeted African Americans because they dont tend to vote for the right?. Wait so you are telling me the right are targeting 10%  of Americans because they dont/won't/can't get identification? African Americans are Americans thus the word American in....African American. I don't follow your point. Could you clarify what you are talking about.. i certainly can. the right is targeting that 10% if not more. The proved this in North Carolina where their voter ID laws got struck down for targeting ways African Americans voters use to vote with surgical precision, and that i s only ONE of the laws that got struck down for the same kind of thing.

Its a tracer thats used as a spotting round to better range in the rocket that generally comes soon after.. Why 9mm though? A 7.62 would be a better choice. It dosent curve off after 50 meters. You know what does curve off after 50 meters though? A 4.2/4.5kg rocket. The tracer is designed such that it will (mostly) follow the trajectory the rocket would.   For ranging.

The breastfeeding isn't the weird part. It's bringing an infant to a concert. I'm assuming this is a musical concert you were attending? Just why bring babies to those? .

Providing 5.3 billion barrels of oil worth $267 Billion means that each petrodollar does not have value come up out of thin air. The value is given by some of that oil, meaning that a petrodolalr is equivalent to a sum of oil, which gives its citizens incentive to use it **as it has real value.**.

The World Bank shouldn't exist in the first place for encouraging more debt through loans. It basically encourages more capitalism which is a bad thing.. Lack of access to investment funds (on non-predatory terms) is a MAJOR handicap for projects in developing economies..

Ann Coulter, for example, who has been hard on Trump lately just tweeted that today he started to win her back by saying this.. Pretty much.  I voted Trump and I'm glad he's forcing people to talk about issues like this instead of pretending they are not a problem.  He's not wrong though.  Bringing in higher income and more educated people is objectively better short term then trying to absorb the poor of another county.  EDIT: Downvotes for honesty. :(. Immigrants from Haiti and Africa tend to the ones seeking higher education and who most likely contribute more to the country than you do.  The immigration rates from those places is low.  There aren't hoards of poor people from those countries streaming in.    So I'm not too surprised to see your ignorance paired with a vote for Trump.. Look bro, it's not complicated.  A middle class immigrant will be less of an economic burden then an impoverished one.  It's just math..

Sure, but Trump is saying he doesn't want the people from those countries.  >Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?  >Why do we need more Haitians? Trump said, according to people familiar with the meeting. Take them out. . Non English speaking no trained laborers. They dont send the brightest.

Everyone from poor countries will not end up senators. Hell even the vast majority of natural born Americans wont either... True. But immigrants from poor countries have a better chance of being hired by Donald Trump in his hotels than a natural born American. He kind of needs to pick a side.   Like if an immigrant from a shithole country is taking our jobs its because people like Donald Trump are giving them the jobs.

You can see our explanation for such a use case in our r/politics comment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7prjm4/trump_attacks_protections_for_immigrants_from/dsjgyyi). CNN is featuring the word prominently in its chyron, but Blitz Woofer is pronouncing it S-hole.. I want to hear Anderson Cooper say shithole over and over again now.  EDIT: [Dreams do come true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggrMHGX9XYM) U0001f62fU0001f62eU0001f60d. If i was taking a shot for every time Anderson has said shit hole in the past hour, i would be hammered. Or dead. . You should do a squat thrust every time he says it instead . Local man found with thigh muscles mysteriously exploded murmuring Damn Anderson over and over.  Police are perplexed.. He really doesn't like Anderson, IN.

t3_7prke8	0	*	Trump attacks protections for immigrants from shithole countries in Oval Office meeting. Why would anyone want to move from Norway to a shithole country like USA?. I keep seeing variations on this theme in this thread, it's kind of a weird argument to make if you disagree with Trump.  I mean, if the USA is a shithole country compared to Norway, then what is Haiti compared to Norway?. A bigger shithole. But you are missing the point. That language is fine in an interent comment section not when you are the head of state of a nation-state.  I really hope I don't have to explain why.. So then, the issue isn't that what he said wasn't true, just that it was rude and improper.. Unpragamtic also in terms of relations.   Unpragamtic politically  in terms of those law abiding constituents that came from those countries who now feel like the current president isn't their president because he obviously doesn't want them.. And you think those people were Trump supporters prior to today?. Genuine question. Do you think it's ethical for a president who has law abiding constituents from those countries to state the he doesn't want them from these 'shitholes'.   Imagine being a law abiding citizen from one of those countries. How unwelcomed you would feel that your president just explicitly stated that he doesn't want your type of people here.. You already admitted yourself that his statement was true, just that it's improper for a head of state to speak so plainly.

Gentle reminder that the last time Trumo talked about African immigrants he grumbled that they all have AIDS and would never go back to their huts.

What's wrong with that then?. In 2018 the right wing is legitimately asking whats wrong with a US President making immigration decisions based on skin color. . Ah yes because there is absolutely no way that skin color is correlated with societal achievement, egalitarianism, lawfulness, and rate of employment.

Weird to say when his grandfather came from a country that at the time was viewed so negatively by Americans that he had to claim he was from Sweden. Not weird, unfortunately. All that matters is that these are groups he wants to dismiss, denigrate, and dis-empower. It isn't rational thought at play here - it's politics of the oldest and ugliest sort. .

That you didn't define merit, let alone in a manner that would provide a rational basis for an immigration system.. And can you describe a rational basis for current system? Waiting.... If the current system isn't rational why is it worth being legalistic about it? Why spend public money deporting people for no reason?. Well the current immigration system isn't relevant to people that have broken the laws and illegally come to America. A country isn't a country without borders. There are zero countries in the world privileged white Americans are allowed to sneak into without consequences.  Why spend public money paying for services for illegal immigrants for no reason?. We have borders. Obama broke deportation records.  Net migration between the US and Mexico is very low, almost zero.

There are almost as many Norwegian Americans as there are Norwegian's in Norway.   Might actually be more.. That is nothing. There are seven times as many Irish Americans as there are Irish in Ireland.. yeah but don't let Irish in Ireland hear you call yourself Irish because your granddad was. Actually seen a tweet from an American Irish guy, aimed at a native Irishman saying how he wasn't as Irish as an American Irishman because he went to Ireland once and they weren't even drinking Guinness in the pubs (which may have been founded in Ireland but is now British owned) it was completely bewildering to see.. I find a lot of European Americans are often more European than the Europeans themselves.   It's sort of unsettling to see as a native Norwegian, when the Norwegian Americans celebrate 17th of May even harder than us. And we celebrate it pretty hard. . But wouldn't this abstention from retarded nationalism etc. be something that is (western) european.  So Americans celebrating that shit so hard, is more them stamping their american culture on top of whatever they know from their ancestors countries, because they desperately want to have an ingroup to identify with.  If anything that makes them less european imo.. Norway is probably one of the most patriotic nations in Europe. Where most countries independence day or national day is hardly even noticed, Norway will be out in the streets celebrating it all day long, it's primarily for kids, but you can see crowds like [this](http://www.holmliakor.no/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/17-mai.jpg) all over Norway on the 17th.

Even if this kind of opinion was an okay thing, the way he says it is absolutely unbecoming of a head of state, or almost any politician really. The real problem is that the unprofessional and ignorant think this is how things should be done at the highest level of politics.. Though Obama was incredibly unprofessional as well. It's amazing. The left and the right finds the most meaningless things to try and make the president look bad. I wish Americans would think critically about both presidents and stop this kind of tribalism way of thinking.. >unprofessional   Awesome, so how do you think Trump should correct this unprofessional behavior? Anything you're hoping to hear from him if he chooses to address it?. My comment was about the hypocrisy and ridiculousness of the witch hunting and tribalism mentality that exists on the left AND the right. Nothing more. I was neither denouncing nor praising either presidents. So you can just calm down!. Nah, it's just the standard whataboutism that's blossoming all over this thread.

You can't impeach the president just because you disagree with him.  That sets a dangerous precedent.    . It's not because I disagree with him, it's because he's spreading hate and dividing this country more and more, and it's so clear he's unqualified for this position and doesn't really understand what's going on. He might be bad as a president but that isn't grounds to remove him.  There have been plenty of bad presidents before.  He should be removed when he actually does something illegal.  . Yes, it is.  Not reading further, because the point of the president is to preserve the union, not divide the country.. Your parents never said no to you as a child did they?. What?. Your lack of acceptance for rules and laws leads me to believe you didnt have any rules to follow as a child, and that your parents gave you everything you wanted.

Well for a select group of people for a small amount of time, things did get better!. Well, as an outsider looking at the current american policies being pushed, it does appear that for a selected group of people, one could say 1% of them, things are getting much much better recently.. That's nothing new, I think that 1% is usually getting more and more advantaged. Even when the great depression hit the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.  I'm just sick of this gold topped orange making an ass of himself publicly and only getting flak about it from half the major media outlets b/c he's involved with a political party now..

Trumps alt-right base actively loves this and his basic conservative supporters dont see anything wrong with it.. But if Obama had said something like this, those on the far-right would have at least pretended to be offended.. Yes they would because (at least the last decade) the Republicans are anti-left. Doesn't matter what the Democrats say, even if philosophically they're supposed to agree. Doesn't matter how reasonable, doesn't matter if it's factual, they won't publicly agree because the public who vote for them don't want them too..

Of course, We Aussies rank 3, so suck it :P Also, I don't trust the rankings at all because Australia never beats NZ haha. Isnt it crazy expensive to live in Australia?. Yes but we have a high minimum wage and relatively good public healthcare - a coffee is $4-$5 but the person making it is earning at least $18 an hour.. To be a devils advocate, also higher taxes(8% at the top bracket). . Higher taxes but a public healthcare system, relatively good welfare, a great retirement system and government loans for university that are indexed (no interest!).. Just to make sure we have our facts strait, the united state's welfare system is comparably pretty good and has some pretty great retirement programs that people can take advantage of(social security and different savings dedication stuff)  But for the rest, everything has an opportunity cost, and our lower tax's result in less social services.     .

Is America a homeless shelter?. I think America has a reputation for providing opportunities for damaged and weak people.. That doesnt mean we need to set aside our resources and people for every single person who does live in a shithole country. I disagree that America First is a white supremacist phrase. But its been proven immigrants (even illegal) do boost the economy. I can understand not wanting immigrants because they bring foreign cultures that clash with our own, but in my opinion its worth letting them work for better lives.. Legal immigration is fine, but if we just let people in without the actual process, it is breaking the law, and here should be no question about illegal immigrants. They are ILLEGAL. I think the end game should be to make the process of legal immigration much much easier. Especially when considering the economic gains for the US and the hugely substantial life improvements for people coming from less developed countries. . We already have too many poor and unemployed people, not to mention crime. Government handouts arent going to ease our debt, either

It's almost like Brazil and western countries are totally different scenarios when it comes to gun control effectiveness and really government regulation effectiveness overall.. Brazil is in the western hemisphere and is further west than most of the countries I'm guessing you call western. The West is a cultural designation, not a geographic one. For instance, Australia counts, even though geographically it's in the Far East. That said, I'm pretty Brazil/Latin America in general are also included, so trying to contrast Brazil and western countries *still* doesn't make sense..

Wouldn't a no go zone be like the ghettos in American cities? . Similar probably, it just refers to a place where it's dangerous for police to patrol and people to go to.

Every time I hear people talking about these no go zones in Europe I think to myself most of our decent sized cities in America have areas you don't want to go in. .

I have no issues with a security presence, especially along the borders, however having it be Israeli would be a travesty, based solely on past history of the current IDF interactions with Palestinians in the occupied territories, and zero expectations of significant change.  The UN and international observers provides about the only chance that is moderately impartial to both sides.. There were international observers in Southern Lebanon when Israel agreed to leave. That didn't stop Hezbollah from starting the 2006 war and from now having 100,000+ missiles aimed at Israel.  International observers do nothing but serve as human shields for terrorist organizations.. observers, without armed peacekeeping forces who are empowered to keep the peace (from both sides), are unable to stop anything. They absolutely need armed UN troops, to stop both Hezbollah as well as the IDF  An Israel security operation is guaranteed to only ever keep a 1-sided peace, exactly as they currently do, and hence ensure no change from the current situation.. UN armed Peacekeepers won't do a dam thing. They don't stop conflict in Africa, what makes you think it would stop it there. The Palestinians would simply turn their weapons on the UN troops.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping#Effectiveness_of_peacekeeping_missions  You're wrong, peacekeeping is very effective.. https://www.timesofisrael.com/rockets-found-in-unrwa-school-for-third-time/
t3_7uh17e	0	*	AP Exclusive: AP confirms Myanmar massacre and 5 mass graves. the media is amazingly silent about this. Yeah, it's pretty crazy to think there's a genocide happening right now, and the media doesn't really see the need to report on it that frequently. had this been on the korean peninsula or any other places with strategic importance it would have been a media storm and maybe even talks about military interventions to stop it. because  we cant just stand by and do nothing  meawhile the genocide in myanmar is something that is barely a sidenote in the paper and barely gets mentioned as everone just stands by and does nothing. not even a peep.. Similar in WWII, the US stayed uninvolved until it directly affected them.. This is not similar at all.  Sorry the US didn't want to risk citizens lives to sort out Europes shitshow for the 2nd time in 20 years.  . They started to fear they were going to be loosing boat loads of money they were lending to the allies as they were going to be turning communist. . Or maybe they got attacked by the Empire of Japan, who was allied with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy? . If you want to go with the romanticised version of history sure, just like ww1 entry was because of a letter asking Mexico to start trouble with the US and not because of economic reasons.

Just from a purely logical standpoint, though, it's not a correct conclusion to draw from that particular statement.. Yes, if we limit our knowledge of the situation to that one statement, it would not be a rational conclusion to draw. .

t3_7rtnu0	0	*	In New York, tourists left high and dry as Statue of Liberty shuts down. Schumer shutdown.. I am confused.  The GOP control all three branches.  Trump is a great deal maker who said that the President was responsible for these shut-downs.  So how is it's Schumer's?. Because almost all of those Republicans agree on passing something to keep the government funded, and it's only the Democrats who are preventing that from happening?   If you go and lie down in the middle of the road, you're not allowed to tell all the drivers Hey, you're the ones driving cars, don't blame *me* for the fact that you're not moving!. Almost all?  But what happened to Trump being a great deal maker and saying that the President owns the shutdown.  Is none of that true? . Trump being a great deal maker or not has nothing to do with the fact that just like in 2013 when the Republicans were at fault for shutting down the government, Democrats in 2018 are at fault.. No, theyre not.   This is 100% on the Republicans collective head.   They *wanted* this to happen. . You can shill all you want for the Democrats, but this falls squarely at their feet. Just like it was the Republicans fault in 2013.   As far as I'm concerned, government shutdowns are great things, because they show the fat that can be trimmed. Of course, our politicians don't want that, they only want to continue empowering themselves and their building up their coffers. . The Republicans controlled Congress in 2013 and 2017.  Your example is meaningless to your argument.

It will be whichever country willing to throw as much resources into the tech- and any group that has unregulated open access with human experiments would have an advantage.  Countries like the US are still rolling out guidelines on this.. Not to mention people will just fly the to get treatments,  pushing them further along the learning curve and pulling more money into China.  Things that are single or a few genes will be the first to be edited. . Yeah, the system does favour those with less scruples.  I just hope that with the head long rush to be first that people aren't fucked up too much.   Who knows what long term surprises we might find that isn't good.. Those are terminally ill cancer patients. The worst thing that can happen is super ultra cancer, but for the patients it's the same anyway.. The consequences are bigger than any individual.  The tech may change what it means to be human irrevocably.  The repercussions are for all of us.. I think you're talking about the technology in general whereas I meant how it is being used right now. It's not even clear if the treatments did anything.   As for the future all I see is that genetic diseases are getting wiped out in humans. No one has to suffer just because he is born with huntingtons, parkinsons or any other genetic disease. I'm not that afraid of repercussions to be honest.

I would argue _especially_ in Scandinavia the days get so long/short, that one hour shift makes little difference.. I live in Finland and I'd rather have more sunlight after work than before work.

Yea we had a citizen initiative to abandon changing times. It gained enough signatures to be received by the parliament.

Does that carry over into treason?  Does ignorance of where the information was going excuse him from treason?. Certain crimes require intent. Think about the difference between murder and manslaughter. Most crimes require intent, or more precisely a *mens rea*. It's just that recklessness or negligence can also qualify as a mens rea.. Actually, that's imprecise.  A Mens Rea is the mental state you need for the crime.  For crimes of specific intent, mens rea = intent.  For crimes of basic intent, mens rea can be negligence or recklessness.  For some crimes which are strict liability, simply doing it is enough.. I'll grant that my comment was imprecise, but as strict liability crimes are in the minority, the comment was nonetheless technically correct.. Mens Rea =/= Intent. So it wasn't that correct :)  (guy who has Crim exams on monday). > Most crimes require intent, or more precisely a mens rea.

Its the/a problem in nearly every political structure.  . They pretty much go hand in hand.. The same can be said with power in general. Where there is a centralised power structure, there is sure to be some form of corruption.. The problem is, socialism by definition has the government with an insane amount of power. Then it gets corrupted. Whereas if you limit the power of the government (capitalism)..... > The problem is, socialism by definition has the government with an insane amount of power.  lel. If we're going to talk about definitions, then what you said is not the definition of socialism.. Well how will you redistribute things without centralised power? Will people just do it of their own choice? lol. There is no need for a centralised state to achieve this. Once the state is abolished, there will be no-one to enforce the capitalists claim to their private property, making the capitalists claim pointless. A factory, after the revolution, would go back to producing stuff, but instead of the capitalist telling them how to run the factory, the workers would decide how to run it democratically.

I don't see reasons why Germany and Hungary would attack their neighbors. Most Europeans learned from ww2 why such land grabs are stupid.. Technically, if the Nazis hadn't also tried to fight a land war in Asia while fighting Europe, they probably could have held most of Europe. And the US would probably be too busy to send help this time around. So no Russian or US help.. No they couldn't that's a load of horseshit. The German economy was built on credit and was a house of cards, the entire enterprise was done for as soon as the English and French entered. .

For instance if you laundered stolen Russian money by systematically selling them condos in a tower for above market prices.  . $3.938 trillion for Russia GDP  406 billion for Nigeria GDP. Yeah, that's the Russian GDP like Donald J. I don't show any proof Trump is a billionaire, when in reality he's probably upside down on bad loans from Russian criminals.  You're counting all the stolen Russian money being held in blown money-laundering accounts, too?   Don't bother, that's going to be forfeited to the banks and governments.. I love how actual finance experts from Forbes and other top publications estimate his wealth at several billion but in your make believe world the facts dont matter. Trump is broke and Russia is outperformed by Nigeria and fuck all the experts who say otherwise.. Trump can just release his tax returns, and PROVE his claims.     It's no surprise that he won't.  Because he's a habitual liar.   ( e.g.:   Trump's claim of the SOTU,  45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history  Bill Clinton had the 'highest number in history' when 66 million people watched.     And the lie is SO easy to prove.   Face it, the guy's -- at best -- senile.  . Get caught in a lie and you just move on to the next thing. This is why its useless to argue with you guys . Morons and traitors who pushed the whole Obama wasn't born in hawaii lie have no credibility, and the sub-human filth who remain with the GOP knowing of their official support for child molesters aren't even worth pissing on.  You irrationally believe anyone gives a shit what you think?   Unsurprising.  . You sound hysterical. And you wonder why people dont take you seriously l. Youre like the infowars idiots of the left

Some of the other office running Shenanigans i enjoyed were Howard Stern for NY Mayor/Governer (dropped if i recall due to not wanting to disclose his personal finances), and a Ficus plant presumably beating a previously unopposed candidate in New Jersey. Mr. Potato head (as in the toy) ran for mayor of Boise, Idaho in 1985.. Donald Trump (as in *Home Alone 2*) ran for US Presidency in 2016.. Inconceivable.. You keep using that word ...

The rules have been thrown out the window. I dont think we have to worry about that.. Berlusconi should be in prison for life. He's even banned from running again till next year and he's still leading the polls.... I'm not Italian, but I admit I am secretly rooting for him to win just to say fuck the system. .

I don't get it... why is Marry Poppins fascist?. She set rules and enforced them with an iron-fist. Ain't no one stepping a toe out of line in that household. That's... not fascist? Not every authoritarian is a fascist.. Around here authoritarian, fascist, Nazi, white supremacist, republican, and they who try to differentiate between those are all synonymous. . Well, Nazis are authoritarian, fascist, and white supremacist.  Republicans, too, are authoritarian, fascist, and white supremacist.  There is some overlap between the two, too.  However, there is no symmetric relationship between being a Nazi/Republican and being an authoritarian. While every Nazi/Republican is an authoritarian, not every authoritarian is a Nazi and/or Republican.. I don't think the Nazi's were white supremacist, they were Germanic supremacist. They admired many other races, but they just thought the germans were the closest to to the purest.  They were also firmly against capitalism which I'm pretty sure the Republican party is very pro.  There is a overlap in most politocs.. German supremacist is just a white supremacist with a more refined and focused object of worship - just one ethnicity and one skin color, as opposed to just skin color.. So, if a white person considers himself superior to everyone else in the world, but he doesnt consider other white people to be superior to people of other races, is that person a white supremacist just because he happens to be white?

Because I really don't see how Oliver is being a cunt. . He's meddling in a sovereign election for shits and giggles. He's making a mockery of another country's political process in the midst of a pretty serious situation. On top of all that, it's not very funny or clever (in my opinion). It is very clever because it sheds light on hot topics and they are discussed by people who care. You cannot believe that he seriously wants to meddle in their election.... it's clearly satire. . It's just a prank, bro!

Correct thinking, we should work as few hours as possible and if wealth was more equally distributed we wouldn't even noticed a change in our quality of life..  Wrong, people deserve to get paid how much their bosses think they're worth. If they are not happy with their wages they can look for a new job. If their labor is valuable enough, then they will get higher wages.. Lol, you're not serious right? You actually believe that? Only 18 year old kids who just read Ayn Rand think the free market works like that.. The free market is not the labor market dummy.. Bosses will exploit workers as much as possible dummy. That's not a good thing dummy.. And workers will try and work as little as possible for as much compensation as possible. Its just human nature to want as much for ourselves as we can. The trick is just playing the two forces of labor and management/ownership off each other in balance so both can get some of what they want without either becoming too strong.. The balance is 99% in favour of the owners and 1% in favour of the workers, so yeah it's not working right now.

There's literally nothing else to do until supervisor checks the code and project works fine, or until they find a moment to have a meeting with me to review the changes. And sometimes, because I work basically directly under the boss (have office in front of his), that means I have days where I don't even meet with him because he's constantly busy..

They can have their opinion and express it, except where we dont want them too. Again, slippery slope.. We've got the same law in Canada, and I don't see a problem with it.

People should pay for their stay kids free-stuff themselves.. We already pay for the delivery of a child someone decides to bring to term, why shouldn't we pay for the abortion of one someone doesn't want?  It's certainly bound to be cheaper. I don't think one follows from the other. I also don't question the validity of health care, I just think that minor bills should be footed by the person responsible for them.. They certainly do, including your own reasoning.  A person has made the choice to have sex, and should have to shoulder the burden of the consequences of that decision.  The intended outcome is quite inconsequential.  So, we (health care) pays to deliver children, and in turn should also pay for the abortion.. You could equally well say we shouldn't pay to deliver children.  Again, I think sharing big bills is fair but if you can pay for your own stuff you shouldn't expect society to chip in..

t3_7py4x9	0	*	Surgeon who burned initials onto patients livers fined $13,600. That's it? These people have his initial permanently on them. Seems like a light punishment.. Seems akin to an artist signing their work. Didn't really cause harm to to the patient did it?. It's carving into someone's liver, so I am not sure. You can say no, but if something happens in the future it could be argued it hurt them.. He used a medical tool to burn his initials into the liver. Im sure he recognized the dangers as a doctor and assumed they were absolutely minimal.   I don't know, I don't think he's really evil for that. It's probably not the best idea, but I can see his side of it. If the risks are minimal and he's really proud of his work then what's the big deal?. Unnecessary mutilation of a human body is a crime. It doesn't matter if it is safe or not. . To mutilate something means you are destroying something. Signing initials on an organ he transplanted is in bad taste, but it's not mutilating the organ. It works perfectly fine before and after. . Pretty sure the cells he burnt are mutilated. It doesn't matter what opinion you have of it, the fact is he performed a procedure on humans without consent and part of their bodies has now been destroyed because of his criminal actions. . The liver regenerates, it's the only internal organ that has that capability.  He should be fired for unprofessional conduct, but to say he 'mutilated' the patient is dramatic hyperbole.

I have anonymous sources that tell me /r/worldnews, /r/news, and /r/politics are filled with RU trolls.  Peace be upon Putin.. I just did a casual analysis of T_D. The correlation of upvotes to comments is about 0.36. In comparison the correlation of upvotes to comments on r/pics is about 0.96 and r/politics is around 0.75.. Have you seen how people react when they look through your history and see you comment on t_D? It doesn't surprise me at all that a lot of people would rather not comment and save themselves the harassment. . The one time I posted on The_Dumpsterfire I was banned for correcting a 'news' story they were all circle jerking each other over that was verifiably wrong.. I was banned from twoxchromosomes and countless other subs just for subscibing to t_D. Seems like nobody wants their echo chambers encroached upon. . I'm gonna have to say that isn't correct. What /r/TwoXChromosomes and the like are doing is wrong, but they aren't banning people just for subbing to T_D. I doubt they can see that, and I've subbed ironically to T_D and haven't been banned from any subs so far. . I suppose I made some assumptions. I lurked on twoxchromosomes since it was a default sub and after I joined t_D I saw a few people mention the autobans so I looked and I couldn't comment on twoxchromosomes. Since I never interacted there to get banned for something else, I assumed it was the t_D subscription that did it.

I mean, go to https://www.reddit.com/subreddits and TD is the third suggested subreddit in this list even if the number of subscribers is 10x lower than others lower in the list.. /politics is shadowbanned from popular and in sign up for new users but TD isn't?  Sorry, meant the top posts page. It's not banned from anything, it's a default sub that everyone is subscribed to until you unsubscribe.. Politics was removed from being a default sub in 2013.  Also there arre no default subs anymore.. I joined well after that and had many default subs that I was automatically subscribed to.  2x, news, world news, get motivated, politics, I didn't subscribe to any of these.. If it was after 2013 then no you were not subbed to politics.. It was after 2013 and I was auto subscribed to politics along with those others I mentioned and more.

They could ban botting algorithms but then we wouldn't get Reddit silver or article summaries.  Politic subs wouldn't have 1/5th the upvotes they get in the first 15 mins of being posted.  But instead were just gonna allow bots and complain that there's literally nothing we can ever do. It's likely possible to just identify every botting algorithm active on t_D, and from there it's possible Reddit staff could whitelist out the better-known ones to find the trollfarm bots.  Mind you, it would tedious as hell and it would take ages, but if that's the only option.... as cynical as this sounds:  what's in it for reddit, inc?  why would they expend the massive manpower to do so?.

Im not a Robin expert but I believe comparing the unsavory fictional characters he stole from to innocent nurses makes this hypothetical rather useless.

t3_7t429w	1	*	Finland to lobby EU for abolition of daylight saving time. Is Finlands forced to change the clocks? I thought each country sets their own timezone and time rules.. It's in an EU directive so yes it's.. But there's countries round the world that don't because lattitude. EU is in UTC+0, UTC+1 and UTC+2.   From +0 there is only UK and Portugal while +2 applies for most Eastern countries.   So most of Europe follows their timezones. But with Daylight saving everyone shifts to +1.   Edit ohg and there is China with one timezone and Russia with everything +2 if I remember right. . Ireland and Iceland too. Not exactly.  We use Irish Standard Time (GMT+1) during the Summer and switch to GMT during the Winter months.  [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Ireland). That still means that some EU countries are in UTC+0, UTC is standard time and is used as a reference no matter what individual countries calls their time zone.. Of course it makes no difference whatsoever.  It's just an obscure little anomaly.

Lawyerspeak for bring it, bitch.. and we love billing more hours and we will crush you with legal fees, and totally make you give up, regardless of the merits of your case. Yeah that's what the crown is doing with the Nazi pug case to count dankula in Scotland.. Everything about this statement confuses me.. Tl;dr:  Guy in Scotland taught his GF's pug to raise its front leg in a nazi salute everytime he said Heil Hitler, as a joke/way to wind up his GF.  The government decided he should be thrown in jail for this.. That's what happens when you live in a leftist country without freedom of speech.

t3_7p66h6	0	*	Google sued over male discrimination. It's OK to be White.. literally no one didn't know that. some people find it offensive to state.   https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/10/its-ok-be-white-campaign-rankles-higher-education/. Because it is belittling to others. Being white as never been a problem. Framing it as though it is some kind of problem and that white people need to be reassured that they are ok to be white just diminishes what non-whites have had to deal with in this country for centuries. . This is a conversation in a thread about a company discriminating against white men.. A company that has majority white males employed.. > A company that has majority white males employed.  Because the majority of the workforce with the necessary skill set are white males. If you've read the documentation, anyone who cannot reduce the ratio of white males to minorities in their department to the appropriate quota is booed at management meetings.. Allegedly.  > Because the majority of the workforce with the necessary skill set are white males  Ever wondered why that is?
t3_7p66h6	1	*	Google sued over male discrimination. losing frivolous lawsuits just to express your opinion is as american as apple pie.. it's not frivolous, there is plenty of proof, that google is biased against white men. Welp, it took two second to disprove you, link below:  http://mashable.com/2014/05/28/google-employee-demographics/#CTAWi8xHB8qM. That only proves his point. Google has 30% women, while only 15% of people graduating computer science are women - to achieve this ratio, women are twice as likely to get hired.. Read the fucking link. Tech jobs at google is 83% male. Women are 50% of the non-tech jobs.. Ok, so in 2014 they had 17% women in tech compared to 13% of their proportion in society, and [now it's 20%](http://fortune.com/2017/06/29/google-2017-diversity-report/) compared to 15% of CS graduates. Not twice as likely, but still biased.  We can argue if this bias is justified or not, but don't pretend like there is no such bias.. This implies that Google is the ONLY COMPANY for CS grads.   The percentage will never be exactly the same as graduates. Thats not how statistics work. . About 30% over representation of a group usually does not happen by chance.

I mean YouTube probably wouldn't be what it is today if a lot of people didn't end up lost clicking video after video until they realize they're halfway through a cooking video but all they have in the fridge is ramen and some left over pizza.

Facebook is 98% useless garbage noise and maybe 2% actually socializing with friends now   Its become junk mail  . Dont forget how they now want to see a high resolution picture of your face when you create a new profile. That's ridiculous. Deleted my facebook because of this. . When did that start? . Not sure, and I'm not sure if everyone has gone through it yet. But I tried to create a new facebook page not associated with my previous one, and facebook asked for a clear picture of my face. Stating that it will be deleted once facebook reviews it. . Its to prevent spam accounts. They run a facial recognition algorithm on it and store a 1-way hash to make sure its unique. They only do it when they suspect you have a large number of spam accounts.. As a developer, knowing what image recognition software is capable of, I would really rather not give a major corporation a high quality image of my face attached to my name. Problem is, I've been active on social media since I was 13, so I can't undo it at this point.. Anyone who is willing to do this just to use their boring website is a sucker.  It would not surprise me if scammers try to track this kind of thing to filter for the most gullible.. Many of us made the choice to participate as children, too, or had our parents choose for us.

To be fair there's places in American with higher population than all of Canada so Canada population is not a great comparative sample size. .

Domestic production, but not supply. The installation industry will take a big hit from this, as they will have to pay far higher prices for US-made solar products. It's an attack on renewable energy in the false guise of 'helping' American manufacturing.. The industry can take the hit, and we have let Chinese subsidized panels nearly destroy domestic production. It's time we imposed tariffs on Chinese panels.. The installer industry is way larger then production so its going to kill jobs.. Cost has never been a huge factor in US solar adoption. People want to make the switch and they are.. In the Midwest it's a major factor especially in coal country . Those that want to make the switch, and there are a lot of people that do in the US, are making the switch regardless of cost. No one is going to convince coal enthusiasts that anything is better than coal. People that have taken a hard stance on the side of coal do not care for facts and cannot be convinced through logic that that are wrong. . Who switches energy sources to power their house without considering cost? The only people who can afford to do that are rich people. For most people its a pure economic decision.

What experience are you making this judgement on?. He is doing exactly what I wanted him to do; our President made promises on the campaign trail and has largely followed through. That is about as succinct as I can put it. Not perfect, but no one is. By these metrics I consider him to be doing very well.  No, I don't regret voting for him.

All the stories that have been told of Trump since his election beg to differ.. all being you're going to cite koi and then just fiercely deny reality for the rest.. Mueller subpoenaing Trumps financial records, Trump receiving access to WikiLeaks emails before they were released, Russian collusion to influence the election, having strippers piss on a sex doll in Trump Tower, Flynn being reported as testifying to collusion, MLK Jr. bust being removed from the White House, Michael Wolffs *Fire and Fury* book, to name a few.

Or simply someone who disagrees because that's what has gotten me accused of being Russian or Trump cultist before, even though i'm neither Russian nor American. One side is far more likely to listen to fake news and bots, lets not kid ourselves. . Yeah, the Democrats. 34% of Democrats actually trust the News versus 11% of Republicans.

That's because Republicans have bought into Trump's moronic Fake News claims and therefore now ironically seek their news from actual non-credible sources.  Democrats have very reputable news organizations like The Washington Post and New York Times which have high reporting standards and are actually trustworthy.. Or because Democrats listen and believe what they are told. No, rational people generally read an article, consider the reporting and sources, and decide whether it is credible or not.  Irrational people like you instead blindly accept whatever Trump says and calls anything that reports otherwise Fake News.. > Irrational people like you instead blindly accept whatever Trump says and calls anything that reports otherwise Fake News.

Anybody who uses the word 'chemical' with a negative connotation simply lacks the understanding of what that word means.  If they lack that then they surely lack the skills to discern important risks in any field related to chemistry.    I don't really know what you're getting at with the second bit there.

This should be discussed around the world, not on the 3rd page of reddit. Putting the entire human existence at risk to turn a profit is barbaric.. This isn't about profit so much as a lack of regulations in asia.. We are in an era of de-regulation in the U.S.  We are heading in their direction, less regulation, less education, anti-intellectualism and more superstition.

[Trump is Quietly Deregulating the Administrative State](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-reducing-regulation-controlling-regulatory-costs/).

The regulation, imposed under Barack Obama, would have added millions of dollars to the cost of fracking operations by piling burdensome and duplicative red tape on energy producers operating on public lands.  Is that it?  Two small rules?  Anything significant?

I don't think poverty excuses their actions on this matter.. if you are unable to eat, you will do whatever you need to to survive.. Which is why regulations are important, because you cannot count on someone acting outside of the self interest. Conservatives seem to not understand this. A conservative/libertarian position to this would be let the market forces sort out the global health apocalypse, maybe there is some profit to be made.. I think the catch 22 is that people will act in their own interest regardless of regulation (not actually a catch 22, just wanted to reference your username). ?

Nah man it's inconceivable that someone who made their pussy grabbing comments while his wife was pregnant and paid off a porn star they were having an affair with only months after said wife gave birth to his son would pay prostitutes to pee on a bed. Completely and totally inconceivable. . My question is why does this matter?. My question is why has your question turned to that question? . Mostly cause i couldnt care less if a hooker pees on a grown man. Just not sure why everyone else is so concerned.. Cause he's your active POTUS.  And not to rain on anyone's equality parade or freedom parade but a president should be held to higher standards than what he is being held to now.  In my opinion, liking o be peed on isn't the most stable or sane thing.  Not judging, just don't think I like the fact that our president may like being peed on.  Just isn't right. Nah bro im a canuck.  What is unhealthy(mentally wise) about paying someone to pee on you? Should presidents not be allowed to do anal? Should he only be allowed to do missionary on sundays? I thought we were trying to get the government out of our bedrooms.  Lots of powerful people have fetishes where they are being dominated.. If you're a canuck, then shut the fuck up?  Why do you care that Americans would be disturbed that Russia has a tape of Trump getting pissed on by hookers?  He's not your president.

Cool, Im not going to take you stupid birther bait, so now were back to my original question. If the dossier is definitely fake, please provide evidence. . Provide evidence it's real and factual, the burden of proof is on you not anybody else. People keep saying this like they have some preconceived idea about what I said. Please quote me on where I said its real and factual. Ill wait.   The burden of proof is on the person making the claim. The only claim Ive made is that its unsubstantiated.

I don't understand how to be a critical thinker when everyone is lying and there's no way to know the truth without someone telling you the truth. .

[relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/435/)  When the US for instance pushed coal as a solution to global warming, one could see through that with an understanding of physics. You would also understand why those storms rolling into central america are probably intensified by global warming, even if it has yet to be proven.. Wouldn't that mean studying climate patterns? That's a specific area. Saying study physics makes it sound like you are just throwing out a broad term because you don't know what you're talking about. . Yes, however physics has more uses. I believe you might be familiar with people claiming allergies to wi-fi for instance.   And physics is a broad term, thats part of the point.. I don't need a physics degree to understand that allergies from wifi are imagined. There's an Intervention episode about a woman that thought certain flowers were giving her migraines. She also believed the microwave, certain spots in her house, and certain people were giving her migraines. I really don't understand your point with that example?

Physics has to do with everything. Global warming, missiles, space exploration, feeding people, it's all physics at the base. You wan't to educate yourself, you have to start with the building blocks. If you just rely on other people telling you if things are real or not or possible or not, you will never not be manipulated. . They proved that the statistics regarding global warning were tampered. My point is, you can't rely on facts because the facts are swayed for different agendas. My point is, it's impossible to know what's true because I don't personally measure the weather, I don't think I need to have an in depth knowledge of space exploration either.. Seems kind of irrelevant when it comes to politics . It helps you know who is lying and who isn't, which is information you can use to inform yourself about the likelyhood they are being honest about other things.  Physics does not deal with facts, it deals with models. Knowledge is always better than ignorance, even if your goal is just to be happy.. ok sure.

And now you have confirmation that the FBI is looking at it as well. What do you do? Not report on it?. It's literally my buddy told me that someone else said [X]. This isn't journalism.

Sure, sure, he's the beacon of being truthful.. I'm not saying that; I'm saying that he has successfully goaded the media into destroying their reputation.. So thats the thing. Trump hasnt goaded the media (like its a monolithic entity) into anything, hes goaded *you* into believing that the media is not reputable.

Honestly, depending on the actual circumstances if this even happened, how do you think the general public would respond? If anyone was to be able to own this, I'd assume Trump.. The issue is that it opens him up to blackmail by foreign nations. No one should want that from their POTUS... Then there would be the fact that he's lied repeatedly about the tapes if they do in fact exist.. It's only blackmail if you care about it being released.  Then again if tapes do come out after he's said they don't exist, it'd be pretty blatant.. Nah, a big aspect of security clearance is making sure you can't be blackmailed.

There is no way in hell the FBI would publicly confirm the dossier even if they knew every single part of it was true. Why the hell would they ever confirm likely classified information?. If the FBI could confirm 100% that Trump was being blackmailed by the Russians because they have the evidence, they would have finished the investigation by now and charged Trump.. Absolutely not. That would be incredibly sloppy. You investigate all possible illegal activity and then present the evidence. If everything in the dossier was confirmed but there was still a hell of a lot more illegal activity, I would want the FBI to investigate all of it to find out who all was involved and to what extent.. Dude...if the FBI could provide evidence that Trump has been money laundering for the Russians and have been blackmailed by them...they would have already provided that evidence by now and charged him. . Thats not how you do investigations. You find ALL the evidence then present . You find all the evidence necessary to charge, and then you do it. If Mueller hasn't charged Trump yet, its because he doesn't have enough evidence.. He hired 16 prosecutors...  16 of the highest profile prosecutors in the country.

Nah, the US has selected him and we will respect that. He is here to protect US interests and if you want to select an idiot for that it's your own problem.. The US has nothing to do with it.  Trump selected him.  We're just under occupation, and there's no reason for any other country to put up with the psychos he appoints.. Trump is your president.  That is a fact.  Apparently you do not let pesky things like facts have an impact on your opinions but it is still a fact.. I didn't vote for him, and the majority sure did not. Read through the news and you'll see that while he is the president, he is illigititimate, crass, lazy, hateful, and on the extreme mental decline.  I guess that's why he is your president . I also voted against him but unlike you I let reality have an impact on my beliefs and opinions so I know he is my president and that he is YOURS as well.  Your bigotry is showing and that is the type of mentality that will put him in office again.. >  Your bigotry   that's not what this word means..

What's there to explain? They stole wealth in Russia during the privatization under Yeltsin after the fall of communism and ran when Putin came into power. That's why they're living in luxury in the UK.. Helping prop up the London property market and the banks are raking it in with commission on mortages, thereby pushing out a generation of britons or have them basically living on poverty, or in enormous debt to own their own home.  .

Peace and love from india and say hi to jack ma for me but try to restrain from pinching his cute cheeks ok.. > we Indians can only speak our minds.  you literally took his own insult and repeated it. so you're not really speaking your mind as you can't even come up with an insult.  Also, I don't think you're actually Indian considering your name is like a slur against Indians, just someone trying to stir up dumb shit, which actually makes you even more pathetic than I originally thought..

No one is stopping him from leaving.. *hurr durr he's free to leave whenever he wants, it's not like any world power wants to put him in a black site torture prison or anything*. Well, there's absolutely no evidence of that. It's his fault he skipped on bail in Britain. There's currently no U.S. warrant or charge or existing extradition request. Or should his actions have no consequences?. There is no existing extradition request because it would add a surety to his fears.  Better to wait until he has left the embassy then fast track an extradition request. . The guy is a histrionic narcissist. If he hadn't jumped bail in Britain to avoid answering questions about Sweden he'd be grandstanding in Ecuador or Moscow by now. Actions have consequences and Julian doesn't get to be special.   Remember too, he volunteered to come out if Chelsea Manning got out of jail.. Weren't people whining that she wasn't released yet, Is she free now?. She's been out for a long time. Oh good, that's not a defense anymore.   Then yes, By all means Assange, get the fuck out already

t3_7txes1	0	*	White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now. Wow, I just don't see how anyone votes Republican after this. Say all you want about immigrants but its white people who are destroying this country. . How is this destroying the country?. Destroying the country is a bit much, but letting our most significant adversary off the hook against everyone's advice is just plain odd.. You should not escalate the situation with Russia. Where do you think that's going to head? Do we want another cold war? Russia is weak, and if you push Russia into a corner you have a state willing to start nuclear war on your hand.  US-Russia relations are the lowest they've been since the 80's and the situation needs to be de-escalated. . Sure, they're weak. However, the strong don't remain strong by letting the weak get away with a sucker punch.. But why make such enemies, especially when they have the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world!?. Hardly a reason to let them leave their nose up our business. It's certainly no reason to let them have influence over Europe, especially when the Eastern part is done being under their thumb.. I agree that NATO should guarantee the independence of the Ukraine (which they haven't done) but other than that, Russia does not have eastern Europe under it's thumb in any way shape or form (except for Belarus, which is voluntarily part of the Russian SOF).

Keep it up please, this is the kind of thing that got Trump elected. . Weird. Im white and wasnt offended by that nor driven to vote for an imbecile.  Are you that thin skinned?. You mean all white people aren't exactly the same? No way! . Idk are they?  You seem to imply white people are going to rise up and vote for trump because they are being made fun of. Thats surely a good reason to vote for a imbecile . They already did, he's currently the president. I'm saying that a lot of people close to the ideological center (note all the counties who voted Obama that flipped to trump) were turned off by the liberals need to vilify white people, and thus moved right. Of course there is more than one factor, and I don't even think this is one of the top ones. It's just one more factor that led to it.  . There are many reasons for his electoral win. He won a few counties that carried him honestly. Dude have you not been paying attention at all. That's litterally exactly what I just said. There were many reasons, and I believe this was one of them. Not sure what your point was about the counties, but 206 flipped from Obama to Trump. That's pretty telling. 
t3_7txes1	1	*	White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now. Im shocked that Trump wouldnt do that to the one country he hasnt criticzed heavily or insulted its leadership.             Edit: Why do some of you people think that Putin is going to nuke the US at the slightest insult?. Just what kinda dirt do they have on this guy?  No seriously!  We already know about his pee-pee parties, so it's not like that can be used against him anymore.  Yet he still capitulates to the Kremlin like there is something actually worse than THAT still floating around out there. . My guess is pedophilia. Its one of the few things that could actually sink his political career.  That and murder. People still supported Roy Moore. Why would it be any different for trump?. Yeah but every one of his supporters argued he was dating teens not fiddling kids. If it's pedophilia nobody can use that defense . But in Bible days that was perfectly fine!  Never underestimate the hoop-jumping ability of the evangelical Right.. Fuck evangelicals! Fuck every fucking thing about them!. Those nutbags actually think Trump is the second coming of Jesus Christ (I think mainly because they had already declared Obama the anti-christ, sooooo lol).  But yeah, I'm sure they'll make excuses for him no matter what he does.

No offense but I can't really trust people like you, too many agent provocateurs on reddit.  even if turning it violent would be a huge mistake. . Sure, a healthy level of skepticism is good. And I agree, violence isn't appropriate. Are you saying that what he's done is acceptable though? . Certainly not.. Why are you disagreeing with my statement that we need to do something about it then?. im not, it's just there are alot of obvious and not-so obvious bots that try to encourage easily demonized riots.

You don't get sharp massive changes like that unless you live in a total echo chamber and are completely okay/ignorant about it. . I see an opportunity here.  Seem like GOP can be hijacked/bought and be transformed overnight into basically anything without much resistance from its base. GOP voters are an intellectual blank slate. Thats something that can be creatively leveraged under certain conditions.. Is this Trumps account from 2014?. I am Putin's account from 2016!

[That's really the case.](https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/14/blind-auditions-orchestras-gender-bias)  Some orchestras have everyone take off their shoes.  . I get the practicality of it, but it seem like we are addressing the wrong side of this issue. But yes, easier to lay down carpet than to stop subconscious sexism. . How would you address *subconscious* sexism directly?  Brain surgery?  . Generally its like breaking a habit. Actively correct until the desired result has replaced it. Sort of like not saying 'gay' perjoritavely, in my experience. 
t3_7waukl	1	*	Gay figure skating star refuses to meet with Mike Pence during the Winter Olympics  and Pence fires back, saying he's 'misinformed'. Im just amazed that hes the *first* openly gay US Winter Olympian. That seems like a milestone that wed have passed decades ago. . > That seams like a milestone that wed have passed decades ago.  Maybe it's because judges are subconsciously (or worse, consciously) swayed by minutiae about a performer. Witness how *no* women were good enough musicians for the orchestra until blind auditions magically made them better. . Still doesnt make any sense to me. Not to make a stereotype here, but I just assume like 90% of male figure skaters are gay.  If youre a homophobic ice skating judge, youre in the wrong business.. Yeah, nothing gayer than surrounding yourself with attractive and in shape young women.. It wasnt meant as an insult. But...it just seems to be the case. Look out those costumes for crying out loud!. Lol I was just making a joke. I just think it's hilarious that for many events that puts well dressed men in close proximity with attractive women, it's just assumed the men are gay. Modeling, acting, ballet, figure skating, etc. You forget steelmill worker.... We work hard, we play hard.

I wonder what could possibly cause this!?!?!. Considering adding fresh water to salt water is not going to make the salt water acidic. Climate change seems like not the source.   My guess would be industrial pollution. . Adding CO2 lowers the pH. Its junior high chemistry.. SO.. where does CO2 come from, if not pollution????  . It comes from pollution, burning carbon,  I never said otherwise.  Increased CO2 causes both warming and ocean acidification..   Calcium Carbonate is in Plankton, Coral, Fish Scales, Clam and Oyster Shells, Bone. (Osteogenesis) Topaz blue emptiness from wave to undersea cave.

Yeah, let's isolate them, like we did with North Korea. That worked out.. Worked pretty well.. It's a human rights nightmare with nuclear ICBMs and Chinese protection. In what possible fucking way has it worked well at all?. So they would be completely different if they had no sanctions? You sure you want to go with that one bud?. They started from the same country and countrymen as South Korea. If you want to pretend a military dictatorship surrounding a family cult was the only possible outcome, that is a game you play alone. . What the fuck are you even saying? Wow. Lol.

They state he was not mentally with it.  There's more to come from this story.. Why do you need passport? . My point was that he couldn't fly without a passport, and he managed to get across the country within a few days.  If he was mentally unstable,as they're suggesting, then how did he do it?   Otherwise he tried to dupe everyone and got caught.. You don't need a passport to fly domestic in the US. If you're not American you do.. Even if you are not an american, if you going to stay more then few months in USA you can get driving license  . This doesn't apply in this situation 
t3_7psc2j	0	*	Anonymous donor gives $100M to Canada's largest mental health hospital. Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.. It's not often I'm in agreement with the bible, but on this, I'm with it 100%.  Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honoured by others.. But isn't that merely substituting one reward for another: public praise for a heavenly bonus.   That passage ironically still traps you in the same moral dilemma.  Anyway, besides the point. I'm really happy to hear this as an Ontarian.  Thank you to them.. Perhaps if you're good deeds are for the sole intention of buying your way into Heaven, but the message it's giving is clearly that you shouldn't be doing good deeds for the purpose of seeking praise, but solely for the sake of helping others. . It literally only specifies that you'll have no reward in heaven. It makes no talks of ethics and in fact subverts them by literally using the term *reward*. . No further reward. It's pretty clear from the context that heaven *is* the reward.. Exactly. Which I think you and I can agree that eternal paradise is a pretty significant reward.   So it's not saying just do good for the sake of it. It's saying do good for the *ultimate mortal gift*, the opportunity to participate in an eternal paradise in the afterlife. This passage speaks nothing of ethics.. The true ultimate moral gift isn't immortality in paradise.

I would not get your hopes up about any major member state making an official statement on the matter ever. Or if I become president. . And make the 7th strongest military in NATO our enemy? Every president who said that would reneged for this exact reason. No reason to throw more lives away over this.. I should of put the /s.  Wasn't serious and don't wanna run for presidency. I know, I get it. It would get messy fast. . Oh, sweet. My apologies. Thinking about the chain reaction of fuckery it would cause if the US acknowledged the genocide is crazy now that I think of it. Israel would be in some shit, our military strategy would take a huge hit. . You got fuck-boi Putin and his merry men of dictators to deal with. You got the weird Axis of Evil of Iran-North Korea-Syria that semi exists. Shit is fucked. Can't touch the region with a 9 and a half foot pole without it suddenly bursting into strife.
t3_7zi5i9	1	*	Dutch parliament recognizes 1915 Armenian massacre as genocide. Erdogan goes apoplectic in 3...2...1.... Erdogan and TYT. Not a huge Cenk fan, but to be fair he has apologized and done a 180 on that stance.   He was also a Republican at the time of those beliefs, so he's clearly undergone a lot of ideological changes since he denied it was a genocide. If anything I think he deserves a lot of credit for admitting he's wrong,  something you rarely see out of news media types or politicians. . > Not a huge Cenk fan, but to be fair he has apologized   Well that's good. He's not that much of a cunt after all.. Actually he hasn't done a 180, nor has he apologised in any meaningful way. He says now that he doesn't know enough about it to say either way and retracted his earlier statements without saying sorry for them. Cowardly, equivocating bullshit. He's still every bit the cunt he always was. . Wow, what a monumental cunt. TYT is trash anyway.. I remember when I first started to learn about politics and thought TYT were such a good organization to listen to.   Oh how I was so naive back then lmao. Theyre a bit too cringey for me but SecularTalk is a pretty good alternative. Technically he (Kyle Kulinski) is within their network but hes for the most part independent and doesnt agree with everything they do.
t3_7zi5i9	0	*	Dutch parliament recognizes 1915 Armenian massacre as genocide. When Europeans kill people it is called colonization, bringing democarcy etc. When Turks kill people it is genocide.   Edit: Leopold alone killed more than 10 million Africans in Congo and EU does not recognize it as genocide. This is the hypocrisy of Europe. . It can't be both? . It should be both.  . Then you know this is nothing new. Be like Germany and admit that your ancestors fucked up.   Better than the majority of countries that like to point fingers at everyone else to cover their own mistakes. . I am just saying other European countries should admit their genocides too. . I agree, but that's an ideal world. If two countries are at an impasse because they want the other to admit to their crimes first, nothing will happen. Better be the one to do it yourself and put the ball in France's court, eh?. Of course, this is why I am saying EU should recognize Congo genocide too. . Again, I understand your position. But then the EU will say no you first and Turkey will do the same, and it'll go on and on. IMO, whichever country does it first of their own volition will have the higher moral ground (for what little that counts for these days).

As bad as it may be to spend the rest of ones life under crippling medical debt, in the US we *do* have the option of not dying from treatable diseases and injuries.. You have never seen third world poverty, have you? . I'm aware of the level of poverty there is in the world, but I kept my comment relevant to the thread, which was focusing on the shoddy state of US access to healthcare as compared to other developed states.. I see. you're telling me things I already know though. Tell me something I don't know.

Also don't have a country in shambles because of idiotic corrupt totalitarian regime based on an archaic superstition. . What superstition is that? I thought Assads regime was relatively secular.... Well the President has to be Muslim. Technically secular in name is the ruling party. But just like in America here all the politicians are Christians we get a lot of religious type laws proposed and passed. . Wouldnt that then also apply to Israel where the president pretty much has to be Jewish? . Yes. Did I say otherwise?. Well its just funny you single out Syria while ignoring the fact that Israel also shares the same criticisms of your initial post Don't have a country in shambles because of idiotic corrupt totalitarian regime based on an archaic superstition.   Only difference is that Israel isnt in shambles due to massive amounts of foreign weapons flowing to radical proxy groups... . It is funny how the discussion was about the Syrian government and you have tried to distract and turn it around.   Guess Syria shouldn't have been a shitty corrupt totalitarian regime unwilling to reform. . Actually the discussion is about both Israel and Syria since Israel bombed Syria to its fair to comment on both countries.   Im not trying to distract, its called being objective. The Syrian government is a corrupt murdering piece of shit regime that should be replaced as soon as possible. Just cause I say one government is horrible doesnt mean I think the other one is an angel

But hey, at least they won't have Polish people working in fast food!. Honestly a lot of Britain is very pessimistic now reality has set in about what's ahead with no clear plan in place. I expect suicide rates to increase in the next three years as the future prospects become even worse for the next two generations and the middle class absolutely disappears. . What are you basing that theory on? In what way are we feeling pesimistic? . I am British, feel pessimistic. He's bang on y'know. . I'm British, I think this is wrong, emotions are pretty high among many people but to say there will be Increased suicides in the next 3 years is a bold statement . It won't be suicides because of leaving the EU directly, it will be because of an increase in people living on or below the poverty line. . Exactly.

I was born with sensitive teeth, and though I love cold water, when the ice touches them it hurts like hell. I can't drink from a cup with ice in it without a straw.. Ask for no ice when ordering your drink...? It'll still be cold, and you aren't going to sit there long enough for it to warm up usually. . Are you kidding? Most people sit long enough their ice melts.... I guess I eat and drink fast. I usually have a couple of drinks over the course of an hour or so of eating. . I don't think you pay attention. Cause 2 drinks in an hour is still long enough for the ice to melt.. Not really. . I am an amateur bartender, Profesional drunk. 
t3_7utm8e	1	*	Israel assassinates more people than any Western country, concludes new book. Why is Israel compared to western countries?  Shouldn't it be compared to neighboring countries like Syria and Egypt and, in the same neighborhood, Iraq and Libya.    . Because israel paints itself as a democracy and better than its neighbors . Yet they're surrounded by dictatorships who all want to wipe them off the face of the earth. Probably because they were created by fiat in a country that already had a local population. . No, because they're Jewish.  We won't stop until we drive the Jew into the sea . Why didn't they do it to the Jews before Israel was a thing? Why only after?. They've hated Jews for a long time, it's nothing new.. Historically, the near east has been diverse and tolerant for the most part with only occasional acts of religious hatred.   The change was the rise of nationalism which started in the region in the late 19th century.   Historically Europe was much less tolerant of Jews.

Ah yes...  Invade someone else's house and lock the home-owners in the basement or out in the street, and then complain that the neighbors neither trust nor like you.  Totally reasonable.. Israelis have been in Israel from the dawn of the 20th century. Your metaphor falls apart when you realize the first Israelis legally bought their land, and even if you want to highlight the territorial losses from war, these are people's grandparents we're talking about.  We don't need to delegitimize every county that isn't 100% populated by its first indigenous peoples.. Jews are indigenous to Israel.. White people are indigenous to the Middle East ? TIL. Yeah, guess you did. Middle Easterners are officially considered white in the United States because of Dow v. United States in 1915.  Though to be honest, trying to apply a US- or European-based racial schema (e.g., trying to classify who is or is not white) to the Middle East is pretty chauvinistic.. Ya why base it on what they look like, instead we have a court ruling to decide for us allegedly.   Thank you, my reprogramming has been successful. . Oh, you want to judge based on what people look like? OK.

The majority of the richest countries have large sectors of the economy managed under a socialist model.. No first world country is socialist. Not entirely, not many people advocate an extreme in any direction when it comes to how the economy is structured.

Minor configuration and with guys in the pentagon dreaming up nuclear hand grenades it follows that they have shit in orbit already.. carrier pidgeons can also deliver ordinance, doesn't make them weapons..

I know a few people who genuinely like working there, even in stocking. Meanwhile Amazon has grueling workdays and packing schedules.. sounds legit. Is it really so surprising? Wal-Mart has two tiers of employment basically, as most retail giants do. Part-timers are the bottom tier, but most people working there in the back or long-term employees have full-time hours and benefits. I don't like it, but it's much better than Amazon who shits on everyone. Even their programmers get treated badly unless they're at the highest levels.. there is no metric that agrees with your better than Amazon comment. you're just stating your feelings and demanding I believe it.

It takes balls to do something like this in a country like that. . Iran isn't bad. The West makes it way worse than it seems while in reality doing something like that in Saudi Arabia, our undisputed ally would get the person in trouble way quicker and way worse.. Iran certainly is bad, but it's arguably better than many countries surrounding it.. It's the second best country in the Middle East, and Central Asia. Which really isn't saying much, but there you go. They have a functioning, albeit comparatively deficient, democracy. One that has to pander to rural folk, just like any other country's democracy. They briefly had an even better democracy, but the British and Americans tore that down before it got a chance to get going. . Who's the best?. As a place to live? Gotta be Israel.  I wouldn't want to be born Palestinian though.. yep being a pawn in a massive geopolitical and ideological argument with many countries around you hoping to annihilate you and willing to give their lives to do so must make it a paradise . Most of what you said also applies to Iran, though. It's caught in a massive geopolitical and ideological conflict, and it's surrounded by unfriendly, unstable countries.  Though really neither Iran nor Israel are pawns. They are both big regional players.  All I meant was that if I had to choose a country in the Middle East, I'd rather live in the rich western-style democracy.

Interesting how the headscarf is a symbol of oppression to Muslims in Iran, but in the West it is the opposite.. It is not the opposite in the West. Ask Women who have to grow up within islamic societies in Europe it's nearly the same horror for them.. In sweden they wear it proudly. No dress codes here :/. Did you ever talk to an ex-muslim woman? You have NO idea how it is to grow up within muslim communities as a woman who doesn't want to wear the hijab proudly. . There are alot of them i  sweden and by far most wear hijab etc. I guess they get pressured by their family . But many fight for it within sweden though. Never talked to any, they do t speak swedish very well, and im in IT so i dont have any women in my class. Yeah we got these people fighting for hijab in Germany too and also in the US. But they are islamists and the opposite of true feminists.. No human would want to trap heat on their head in the summertime.  They are brainwashed into thinking they have to to please their deity..

Take enough baby steps and you just might end up making what amounts to a leap. Good.. IMO religions are more about power than faith. The way almost every religion treats women by the fundamentalist branch is very similar. Women are subservient to men in them.. I'd like to point out that Jesus, the ultimate role model for any Christian, treated women with a level of respect and love that was considered abominable by the misogynistic society he lived in..

Now I'm pretty critical of sharia law, but it is an archaic barbaric set of laws. . Nobody is saying they have equal rights. Where are you seeing this?  I see people in this thread praising progress.. Yeah but murzlems! Their culture is much more barbaric than ours in some but not that many respects!. The middle East is fucked up and our culture at the moment is much more progressive. That isn't racist that's true. That doesn't mean Muslims themselves are terrible people

Data collection should be opt-in, not opt-out.. We do opt in.  Every time you sign for a mortgage, credit card, loan, bank account, etc, etc, etc.  Part of that documentation is that they can share you information with interested 3rd parties for the sake of verification, background and credit checks.  I'm not saying I'm happy about it, but try to get a loan without agreeing.  They will just tell you to pound sand.. If you're forced to opt-in, then it's not really opting-in, it's just the way it is.  There should be a real opt-in option.. You're not forced to get a loan.. Ya these plebs should just buy their homes and cars with straight cash. . Or rent and use public transportation/carpool. Despite what tv shows, you dont have to live beyond your means.. Yeah except in order to rent at most places, they do a credit check. So yeah you dont need a loan to rent an apartment but you either need credit history or a co-signer and their credit history.

Guess I need to actually earn achievements to brag about rather than going by what I was born with. :(. Well it's odd to brag, but it's not racist, being a bit hard on yourself there, and everyone isn't black clearly, not anymore, assuming the African Migration theory is fully true, there's a few spanners in the works mainly from discoveries in east Asia. So I don't need to achieve my own successes to brag still? Thanks! Just kidding, but spanners in the works? Not sure what you mean. The racist part wasn't all that serious, don't worry. Just was interesting to hear how far back blue eyes actually goes.. There's contradictory fossil evidence in regards to the African origin theory i mean, it's still the leading theory but it's not set in stone and every changing, we know surprisingly little of our origins in terms of the start point and precise spread and development of different groups.. Any chance I can trouble you with further insight on it? Sources if lazy, I'm interested enough to read it myself, but summaries are always nice too! Thanks!. There is part of a skull unearthed in China. Carbon dating originally estimated it to be 50,000 years old but it was tested numerous times and  was found to be closer to  260,000 years old and therefore predates out of Africa theory by about 190,000 years as the first wave of movement out of Africa was around 70,000 years ago.. Thank you! Can I get a source on this skull, just curious about makeup and whether or not it comes off as homo sapien sapien or just human bro, and/or I would settle for equal ancient evidence found across the world, especially landlocked or separated islands of the current popular theory.

No, and I understand that Quebec med students pay less, especially if they are Quebecois. But again, we're discussing med school debt, which is why I objected to you bringing up your undergrad experience.. In Quebec, a medical degree is considered 1er cycle, which is the equivalent of undergrad elsewhere in North America. There is no such thing as medical school separate from other types of degrees. For most medical students, the medical degree is the first university degree they get. And the tuition is the same as any other 1er cycle degree.

Swop is a British English spelling  Torygraph is a British English publication. **Swap** is the Brit English spelling too, both variants are valid, but swop is most likely used following *swop shop* and is considered lesser by many publications.  The journo seems to swap between **swop** and **swap** throughout. The editor allowed this complete lack of standards.. Swop makes more sense pronounciation-wise, doesn't it?   Rap, tap, nap, trap, clap,  swap.  Chop, clop, atop, swop.. Don't try to make sense of English vowels. You can cherrypick words to have any vowel make practically any sound.

Regarding the stray dog problem culling, education and sterilisation are strategies the government should be looking at but the article I posted was about someone who was bitten by a dog who had an owner.   In order to reduce dog bite statistics in any country dogs need to be effectively secured.. And I don't think you understand. Stray doesn't just mean without an owner. Even dogs owned by people just roam around. Usually in packs. It's some scary shit if you've never seen it, but there are literally hundreds of different kinds animals just running around.

I remember at our company Christmas party last year, the CEO said, and I quote:   You've been exceptional this year and things are better than ever, however we need to tighten our belts for the coming year because the future is uncertain.. If you don't think you're paid enough then quit. Surely another company wants your good attitude. And isn't run by a CEO or anyone who leads anything because god forbid someone has a lot of money. The issue isn't a lot. The issue is about greed and fairness. You can't hide your bias behind a lot. Address the actual point or don't comment.. Except the quote above indicates no unfairness. You are not entitled to a percentage of your company's earnings. You're entitled to the value of your labor agreed upon in your contract.. I'm entitled to not be oppressed by people and organizations in a position to take advantage of peoples lives.  Your logic boiled down- slaves have no right to complain because their contract says they work for free.  If the system isn't fair and people don't have leverage, your perfect scenario falls apart.. You don't need leverage, because you don't have to work for somebody else to live. Even in the most unrealistically extreme case where all businesses mistreat their employees, they still have to be better than if you just start a farm and care for your own needs. Slaves don't have the luxury of choosing that option.. That's not how the modern world works.

No offense, but I'm curious how much experience you actually have with stocks, if any at all. You make stocks sound like a zero-sum game, which is simply not the case. Now if you'd like to talk options.... even options arent gambling lol, what makes you think so?

t3_7wl7vl	0	*	Pornhub Is Banning AI-Generated Fake Porn Videos, Says They're Nonconsensual. By that logic, look-alike porn should also be banned. . Why?  All parties in those consent.. Same is true for AI generated porn. . No.  They own their likeness and didn't consent to it being used.  Likewise the trainer images are owned by the photographers.  So there are lots of big differences.. If that were true, gossip magazines that print nonconsentual paparazzi photos wouldn't be able to exist. Any celebrity who has a nipple slip would be able to sue the magazine to oblivion. . Reread the part where I mention photographs are IP of the photographer.. So, if deep fakes were only made using public domain images, they would be fine? . That would deal with one of those two problems.

When it comes to their homophobia, there isn't much difference between extremist followers of Islam and extremist followers of Christianity. . Not much difference except, you know, the former extremist faction openly puts them to death at will without legal reprisal. . So does the latter? Just like with Islam, any country that is actually controlled by Christian religious forces do their best to kill gay people or put them in prison for life. Most of those places are in Africa as compared to Islam being largely in the Middle East.

Russian power structure is a bit more complicated than might seem from abroad.. there's a long list of dead people killed by putin. There's a long list of people whose deaths are attributed to Putin. Whether or not it's actually the case is debatable. The motives often aren't there. Heck, if he's killing people left and right, why didn't he kill Navalny, who might be his only rival in a conventional sense?. who knows? is that supposed to exonerate him of any wrongdoing or corruption? I wouldn't be shocked if he's alive solely for that reason alone, so people can point at him and go 'see look he's alive, putin doesn't kill people hahahaha'. > who knows? is that supposed to exonerate him of any wrongdoing or corruption?  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. When you casually accuse someone without even a motive, you can easily miss what's really going on.

If there is someone more knowledgeable about this subject than I please share. . > vegan bullshit  Yeah...fuck all us vegans for trying to be healthy and save the environment...which costs people like you nothing because what I do personally has no effect on your lifestyle.  . Easy there, don't get your heart rate up too high, you might faint from malnutrition.    The issue with certain kinds of vegans (not all of them) is their tendency to preach at you and lord their imagined superiority over you. If all they did was shut the fuck up and eat their veggies no one would have a problem with vegans. Alas, sometimes even vocal minorities are enough to ruin an image.. Some of those vegans are perhaps just more concerned with actually trying to effect positive change in the world than with whether or not they have an image problem. If all they did was shut up and eat their vegetables, they wouldnt be particularly effective advocates for change.. Hooh boy, you even have it in your name. Sheesh.    Oh and you can advocate change without going REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE #ANIMALLIVESMATTER REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE #HOGHOLOCAUST, you know? Acting like a spastic isn't gonna convince a lot of people.. Charming.

Who said anything about you in specific? Defensive much, you little pomelo? The people I was talking about here were said certain kinds of vegans.

t3_7nz5z2	0	*	Lab-Grown Meat Startup SuperMeat Raises $3 Million. The future is vegan, no doubt.. If by vegan you mean no animal products then no, it most definitely is not. This is still an animal product.. Veganism is also about reducing suffering. I see what you mean, but if no animals are suffering or killed, I'm ok with it. . If it is about reducing suffering then what is the issue with killing animals in general (not just certain practices)? You can't argue with a straight face that giving a deer a headshot or asphyxiating chickens with inert gases causes them to suffer. The first is trivially true and the second we know first hand from people who underwent it and reported back only euphoria.. Even in the most humane death, their life is still being taken away at a fraction of their lifespan.   It's impossible to come across any factory farm where's there's no suffering involved.. I don't follow. How is there suffering if no pain is felt?. I was referring to the living conditions in factory farms. Plenty of suffering there. So they must go through all that before they are killed.  For the ones that feel no pain in death - what's your point? We don't need to kill them. It's all unnecessary.. Oh but we very much do if wanna eat tasty meat! This might change with technologies such as these but until then there is a strong reason to kill animals. Anyway, it sounds like you'd be down with hunting at least, right?

Simple, because they do not care.  For democrats, us brown people are nothing but political peons. . Employers who pay migrant (or really any) workers less than minimum wage are *breaking the law*. It's useless to claim California hasn't increased the pay for immigrant laborers. The businesses that employ them and pay them slave wages already don't follow the laws.. But California actively supports them by refusing to help ICE and never auditing them for labor standards.

Not only do we spend more per capita, we spend more as a percentage of GDP. And, we have the highest GDP in the world.. humblebrag. More of a we're a pack of shortsighted but productive idiots brag..

Also the nuance of misdemeanor =/= it's ok seems to be lost on people. . It's still a permanent disease that requires a lifetime of medicine. What I'm trying to say here is that there are diseases that are objectively worse than other diseases, and that are much harder to infect others. All diseases shouldn't give the same punishment.

We're not talking about impoverished, barely functional African states, first world countries don't go from okay to poor dying in droves.. They do when they realize the large majority of their goods (that people have grown used to and dependent on having available) don't come from local source (especially all season) but by out of country import. When your county is going to struggle to make good trades, you've got a serious problem on your hands.. Independence from a supranational group doesn't mean relinquishing trade. Especially when their are so many sources to trade from.. It does when that supranational group wants to punish you for your decision. very USSR-like of them

My cynical Canadian response would refer vaguely to colonizing, exploiting, and ruining various brown places for generations and then crying foul when others come to 'walk upon England's mountains green'.. A lot of colonies benefitted greatly from British stewardship. I went to Singapore last year and it was amazingly prosperous, as is Hong Kong. . I agree wrt Hong Kong as it was pretty much a British creation, but Singapore largely created itself out of a swamp. During the time of Malaya it was a dive, and only really started to become prosperous when it got kicked out of the Federation. . Still, it was a British colony.

That means voting even if you think the election is going to be heavily one sided.

I believe it was the biggest voter turn out since 1990. Any body who's complaining is a fucking idiot imo. . This goes to show you how many people wanted it.  If there were that many people demanding rule by Britian versus rule by EU, then Britian has an obligation to proceed with Brexit fill speed ahead.. Democracy can be quite problematic when people vote to fuck themselves over.. So why then do you prefer the tyranny of twenty nation's leaders deciding how your nation will be under them???  Voting for the EU is a vote to be involuntarilly fucked for the rest of your life.. You say tyranny as if the leaders of other EU members form some kind of monolithic bloc. You are aware that British representatives are involved in the lawmaking process, not to mention the UK is an incredibly large and influential member. In fact it gets so much special treatment other EU countries don't get this notion of being fucked by the rest of Europe is utterly laughable.. We tried the EU experiment with the Articles of Confederation here in the US.  It was an utter failure.  Stop repeating the same thing hoping for different results.

No, I dont support brexit but you cant just redo the vote because you dont like it. Those were the terms of the vote, if yall didnt take it seriously thats your fault. Having a redo would set the precedent that every close/controversial vote should be up for a redo. . >Having a redo would set the precedent that every close/controversial vote should be up for a redo.  ...what's wrong with that? In a democratic system where voting isn't mandatory, I think this *should* be the rule of thumb.. What's the margin you have to win by in order for a vote to succeed?  Do you just keep voting time and time and time again until you finally have a 3%, 5%, 10% margin?  A system like that would always favor the status quo, and nothing would change.. Okay, then lets have mandatory voting. Well actually get an accurate view of what the people want.. Most of the people voting don't fully understand the issues they're voting for or against. Mandatory voting would just make for more wild votes. There should be a rigorous test for voting privileges.. Not if you'd do it the way the Swiss do it. Weeks before each topic is up for vote they get information in the mail, both the 'raw data' and what the politicians think about the topic and why.

Couldn't he just as well have been hunting something else which might be why he didn't notice the Lions? . Who cares .. Probably his wife and kids along with any extended family. Hate hunting all you want but this was a human ya piece of shit. . The less poachers the better. Evil being defeated is something good people normally celebrate.. Idk what planet you're from.. . I find it quite troublesome for someone's death to be celebrated. Much less people hoping for him to have suffered. Are you sure you're still the good guy when you do shit like that?. Don't be a poacher and it won't happen, he made his choice even though people think he's scum. Why should we feel bad at all?. You don't have to feel bad about his death. I just find some comments here a bit more than just not feeling bad about it.  Here are some examples:  > Good. Hope he suffered.   --  > Good. Hope it took him a while to die.  > Edit: Funny that I'm being downvoted for being happy a piece of shit got what he deserved.. Animal lovers are hardcore.

I thought that was Alabama? Or Mississippi? Or Florida?. Did any of them make it legal to have unprotected sex if you have HIV and can knowingly give it to people without letting them know?. Pretty sure California didnt make that legal either . They just reduced the punishment the the equivalence of jaywalking . I dont think you have the slightest clue about the subject. Just stop talking about it rofl, make you look pretty dumb.. Well lucky for me my opinion is my own. If someone else's opinion on the internet bothers you so much you should get off now. It will only get worse for you.. Its not about whether you have an opinion, its about you having a strong opinion without knowing anything about the subject you are having an opinion on, which is dumb.

t3_7vmjvm	1	*	Poland's president to sign controversial Holocaust bill into law. I agree with this. How is this Poland's fault when they were left defenseless by the Nazis. Many Poles risked their lives to save Jews. . Either way, why make a law about this? Why not err on the side of free speech?. I don't doubt there were bad apples but you need to wonder how many didn't know what they were doing and/or were brainwashed by the Nazis. . The German Nazis were brainwashed too. That's not an excuse.. While what they did was inexcusable, it was a case for do what you told or die. You can't blame some people for doing what they did in that instance. . If that was their situation, then that's obviously more understandable. I'm sure some were in that situation, but not all. Like every country, Poland had it's legit Nazi sympathizers.  I just don't see any reason why it's good to pass a law banning people from talking about this.. This isn't banning people from talking about it. All this bill states is that the country as a whole cannot be held responsible for Nazi atrocities. . The law imposes prison sentences of up to 3 years for even mentioning the term Polish death camps. This is a fundamental freedom of speech issue.

It's amazing how many people rush to defend these secretive  unaccountable organizations because they dislike Trump.  This isn't your grandfather's FBI/CIA/NSA.  These people can effectively listen in on every conversation everywhere.  That ought to concern you.  Running interference for them simply because you hate the president is embarrassing.. > Running interference for them simply because you hate the president is embarrassing.  Undermining them and allies with inaccurate memos because they're investigating you for federal crimes is... well I don't think it's your particular choice of word, but it's a few words.. How do we know it's inaccurate?. Page had already been under surveillance since 2013, that warrant has been renewed 3 times since then. Claiming the 2016 dossier(originated by Republicans, that part keeps getting left out) is the basis for the warrant is utter horseshit if you have a clue what actually happened.. It's funny how the memo was completely considered fake before it ever saw the light of day. But you reference just one portion. Could you please explain to me why the part about the Steele dossier is not true.. I just did... the FISA warrant on Carter Page started in 2013, the dossier didn't exist until 2016. It was also renewed several times based on evidence collected before the dossier existed.. The memo asserts that the Steele Dossier was biased opposition research that most likely wouldn't be considered reliable to a court. I'm asking why that part is considered inaccurate.. Again as I mentioned the dossier was originated by Republicans. Democrats picked it up when Trump won the primary.

I have had to both spend both euros and dollars since brexit vote and I buy imported goods which have risen in price.. GBP has been falling against both the USD and EUR since 1970 and 2000. If the fall of the GBP against the EUR or USD was going to be such a big impact for you, you should have prepared for it.. >The Euro is the new 'single currency' of the European Monetary Union, adopted on January 1, 1999 by 11 Member States.   So not since 1970.   It sharply dropped after the brexit vote. . That's why I also said 2000.. Use the word respectively in that case.   As to the sharp drop?

And think of all the Bulgarian yogurt you can get at a decent price .I'm assuming that it cost way more in Japan, while in Bulgaria a 500ml bucket costs at max 1 BGN which if i'm not misstaken is less than a 100 yen.. The cheapest way to get yogurt is to make it yourself, and you're looking at 150 for 1L milk.

Seems not worth it. It's much too valuable to be subjected to the dangers of travel.  People can visit it in person if they have to, or watch videos of it or study the image on their pc.. I think the move of the tapestry may also be symbolic of continued strong political unity between France and England. . Or it's a well timed piss take over Brexit.. Given that it shows the last time England was successfully invaded and by the French no less.. Normans spoke French but werent actually the french. most of france in that day wasn't that homogenous so it can apply to all, but the elite spoke indeed french and culturally they were way more integrated  imo it's a bit cherry picking at this point. Indeed. France wasnt even France yet in the sense it is now. the french didnt exist as we see today. Nor did England. Nationalism wasn't invented yet, indeed.

TIL that it is kept in France. I was in the impression that it is in England being an important part of their history.. Normans didn't move entirely from Normandy to England. They kept their territories in what is now France and those territories sometimes were still under the french king rules. Then later the normans/english still had some territories in France and at one point also considered themselves the true french rulers.. Correct, the Normans stayed home, and the English were never Normans. In fact when William came it's similar to when the English/Irish went to America, they became Americans in the new land; As William became more English than anything.   Hence why the Normans kept the tapestry as it was far more important to them than to the English.. > In fact when William came it's similar to when the English/Irish went to America,  It's not similar at all. Like, not even remotely.. In the sense that William didn't conquer and make everyone Norman, he didn't bring hordes of Normans over, he simply settled in the new land.. So first, English and Irish immigration to America are very different and not even from the same period. Irish is way more recent, mostly driven by poverty. English did bring hordes of people to America, they did force everybody to become English (Quxe9bec being the only place where they didn't succeed), and they did wipe out the native populations. Completely different than the Normans.. Did they force Americans to be English or did they simply settle in such large numbers that the natives weren't near colonial settlements? . What does it change?

Since they identify as men then they shouldn't have this problem anymore.  Seriously this is a problem that was most likely never considered and you have an old system that will probably catch up.  Even though it's all kind of silly and people should just accept who they are in the first place.. Men have breast and male breast cancer exists, its just far more rare than female breast cancer. . So is routine NHS breast cancer screening offered to people who were born as men?. No, because it's very rare.. So then it is not surprising I guess that if you tell the NHS you are a man that they will not offer you routine NHS breast cancer screening?. The issue being reported on is that the NHS is aware that these women identify as men whilst still being biologically women - and prone to breast cancer. However, the NHS is afraid of offending them so doesn't offer the routine check. . The article makes no indication that the NHS is aware that these are biologically women. If you have some other source please cite it.. Then why would they be afraid of offending them?

If you disagree then please provide an actual quote from Trump that is as offensive as trying to demonize and dismiss the opinions and concerns of a quarter of the American population like Hillary did with her deplorables comment.

But surely Trump supporters will feel a touch spurned that their signature promise isn't at all happening? And especially when that means that only real political act populist Trump did was to give a giant tax break handout to companies and the rich. And Gorsuch, sure but that was more incidental and all Mitch's maneuvers. The tax break primarily brought the US corporate tax rate in line with international standards. That's entirely reasonable since capital is much more mobile than labor. The real question is why people without relevant expertise seem to have strong opinions about Economics and taxation.. Its it completly fine to have an opinion about something without being an expert. . Why though? We don't walk around critiquing turbine designs of GE engineers or the testwork of accomplished chemists. Why does everyone suddenly feel compelled to have a strong opinion on Economics?  Or at the very least, wait until your opinion has some historical backing. The current tax cuts are similar to Reagan's in a lot of ways, and those two cuts were great for economic growth in the US.. Let's see what the actual experts think, you're big on expertise, yeah?  http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reforms . This literally only addresses the fact that tax revenue will drop as a result of the tax cuts. This is probably true.

The US cant go killing millions of people everytime they want a regime change.. we sure can.  Imperialism is a natural state of human civilizations.. The american dream. Yes the american dream. If we as americans truly believe that our lifestyle and culture is the best on earth than it would be our duty to promote that culture and try to expand it whenever possible.  American influence on south korea made it a wonderful and modern society today. With democracy.. Only an American could unironically say their lifestyle and culture is the best on Earth, and then literally say that they should impose it on everyone else. Just like the Nazis.. He didn't say impose, he said promote.. And expand.
t3_80yuh6	0	*	Polish priest claims Jews have a different notion of truth. That's OK -- priests have a different notion of consensual behavior.. I mean ... probably a bad criticism to pick considering it applies to Jews just as much (since I don't recall babies being able to consent to having their genitalia mutilated).. My mother said I cried more getting my diaper changed. My bits and bobs work just fine.  I never knew people cared so much until I got on Reddit.. You never knew what it was like not to be mutilated so of course you can't be expected to know any better. Can't miss what you never had, after all. Doesn't make mutilation of infants any more excusable though.. Blame your parents then. As long as you don't infringe on our religious rights I honestly couldn't care less what the goy choose to do with their ding dongs.. Uh, what? Are you confused on what my position is? Or am I confused on what yours is?    Quick question, do you think that it's alright for infants to be mutilated or not?. You're confused.  I'm Jewish, so like I said before:  > As long as you don't infringe on our religious rights I honestly couldn't care less what the goy choose to do with their ding dongs.. Sooo ... that's a yes then? Baby mutilation is okay in your book as long as it's done for religious reasons?

No, they pay the terrorists, or usually they give the money to their families. Incentivizes committing the terror attack. . I think if you ask the established Palestinian family that has just had their house bulldozed who the terrorists are, they will probably say the Israeli government and IDF.

Sure, moral equivalency to terrorists.   >But ultimately I'd rather worry about problems at home before I give any energy to problems on another continent  Then why are you commenting? But most of this $350mil is courtesy of the US of A.  . Just conversation I suppose. I enjoy learning about things and expressing my self via debate and rhetoric. Plus the US gives way too much money to Israel (amongst other countries) and IMO you should not be allowed to hold office here if you have dual citizenship somewhere else. Seems like an obvious COI and should be easily nipped in the bud. Who in office has dual citizenship? . *deep inhale* senate- Richard Blumenthal, Barbara Boxer, Benjamin Cardin, Dianne Feinstein, So Franken, Herb Kohl, Frank Lautenberg, Joseph Lieberman, Bernie Sanders, Charles Shumer, Ron Wyden, Michael Bennet *exhales*. Umm... what? Pretty sure none of those people have dual citizenship. Being Jewish doesn't make you a citizen of Israel.

These tariffs were recommended by a bipartisan committee.. >  bipartisan committee  I call bullshit till you source it.. Or maybe you can just google it before calling it bullshit. . If you make a claim, the onus is on you to provide proof of your claim. . I agree it would be helpful, but the absence of proof does not then automatically justify calling a statement bullshit. Especially when the information is easily obtained. It seems pretty close minded to call everything you don't know firsthand bullshit until its proven to you. Unproven, unsubstantiated, questionable all are reasonable responses. . Sure I see what you are saying but if someone is trying to persuade me into something, and gives me absolutely no reason to believe that what they're saying is true, why would I?  Also if someone is trying to prove something to me, why is it on me to verify what they are saying?. As I said, I agree that a source is helpful. But we can only control what we do, not others. So in the event where a not outrageous or obviously false claim is made, but not sourced, writing it off as bullshit is a rather strong reaction. Call it unsubstantiated if you like. But calling it bullshit would require, according to your criteria, proof that it is indeed bullshit.

Social media is powerful but I think Trump playing boss on the Apprentice for a decade plus had far more influence to voters than three months of stupid meme propaganda on Facebook.

All areas Obama fumbled for 8 years straight, and had the media done it's job instead of trying to preserve him (first black president!!!), you'd know that.  . I personally think he is doing a great job domestic policy wise. But as far as foreign relations go, I dont think that the US has ever had this bad of a reputation among the international community. Okay so the EU, specifically the left-leaning German-led nations of the EU do dislike him.  Where else?    Edit: Ooo downvotes, must have hit a nerve.

Thats exactly it - google is supposed to show the most relevant results and not tweak them to promote their own businesses over competitors.. >google is supposed to show the most relevant results and not tweak them to promote their own businesses over competitors.  Why?. Because EU competition law says that having fairly earned a  dominance / near monopoly in one area, search, Google is not allowed to use that dominance to unfairly squeeze out competitors in other areas like online shopping or video. Microsoft go into trouble for similar reasons, they were accused of using their dominance in OS and office to unfairly squeeze out Netscape and other browsers.. How does one unfairly squeeze out competitors without use of the law?. Time to use google, or maybe duck duck go,  because you will easily find resources on this. Including the cases the EU has brought against google, Microsoft and others. . I have, I'm not convinced. Facebook and Amazon have market dominance and Facebook is losing it without regulations. Why is Google special?. Usually the regulators investigate based on complaints by competitors who feel they were wronged. Then they decide whether harm was caused and whether there is a case to answer.  You are right that the regulators and courts are slow and companies might appear less dominant by the time there is a judgment but if you are a competitor who suffered harm you are still entitled to justice.

Beijing said global warming meant viable routes through the Arctic would become important for international trade. China would work with Russia and other Arctic countries to develop the route.. This will be interesting since any global route will need to run through Canada and Canada considers the Arctic it's sovereign territory.. Well, the parts of it that run through Nunavut.  There is another route that goes across Russia which China can also use to get to Europe.. Canada can build Islands, and accuse China of violating it's Sovereignty if it uses those waters.. Canada doesn't even have the capability of enforcing its claimed sovereignty to waters between its own islands.  The idea of even doing so is something that is relatively new.. Im sure the US would be happy to oblige the neighbors. Were already sailing all around the SCS, we could spare some ships to help Canada defend their sovereign waters.. Nope.  The US stance on the Northwest Passage is that it is international waters.  Canada's on its own for that one.. Damnit.  But if Canada built some islands, Im sure we could change our views on manmade islands, yknow, only in the Northern hemisphere.. That's not the reason lol.  It is in the US interest that it is international waters so its own shipping can use it free of charge.

Maybe if your healthcare was more privatized hospitals wouldn't be paying thousands of dollars for a pot of moisturiser. No, the patients would be forced to.. Patients aren't forced to do anything, that's the point of privatization and competition.. Healthcare is not meant to be a competitive industry. Its sole focus is to help people who are sick and injured get better, not to nickel and dime them for every last penny they own and then some.  While you're technically right that patients wouldn't be forced to do anything, having to decide between coughing up for treatment or suffering without leaves them with little choice.. I don't disagree, but there is room to utilize markets and competition without making it worse for consumers. For example, if there was legitimate competition about who provides moisturizer to the NHS surely someone will charge a little less.. Lmao no. They wouldnt charge less because you arent shopping around for who has cheaper hospital moisturizers  when youre getting medical treatment.

Russia is being forced to sit out these Olympics, all of the cheaters have been banned from ever participating again, that is perfectly reasonable.

College is more widely used in the States afaik, but A&M, UT, Rice, ACU, Baylor, etc are all unis by name.. That is really bizarre. It's true that those schools and many more are universities by name (although it's worth noting that it's been a very long time since there has been any distinction between university and college other than just semantics), but I've never met anyone here in GA who uses the term uni. I thought that was just a European thing.. Even weirder, because youre *close* to me. Not even a north v south thing.  Dunno man. English is dumb

Isn't this the beginning to the plot of I Am Legend?  Edit: Holy shit this comment blew up. . Hopefully with a more faithful ending . I liked the second ending . Yeah honestly as long as Will Smith lives I think we're good guys. . Yeah but what about the dog?! :(. I think we all know the pecking order goes:  All Dogs > Will Smith and Tom Hanks > Ellen and Logic > Everybody Else.. Forgot Weird Al. I honestly forgot so many.

t3_7ug4pb	1	*	Cancer vaccine eliminates tumors in mice - 90 of 90 mice cured of cancers with lymphoma, similar results observed in colon, breast, and melanoma cancers.. This is very very exciting.. Why is it that we keep hearing effective ways of discovering/detecting and curing cancer, but it seems like none of them are deployed for us humans?  Aside from Chemo and Radiation therapy?  It's hard to be excited :/. We have to test things for years so we don't have surprises like turns out the cancer vaccine causes super cancer and blindness after 2 years in humans.. Causes *infectious* cancer . The definition of cancer does not allow it to be infectious . Some cancers can be caused by viruses for example cervical cancer. And they can be passed on so technically the cancer isn't infectious but the cancer causing agent is. Also Tasmanian Devils have an infectious cancer that nearly wiped out the whole species.  Edit. Devils not wolves. Though in my defence I'm an idiot.. Is it known if the Tasmanian devil cancer is caused by a virus?. It is not caused by a virus, it is an example of a clonally transmissible cancer where essentially if tumour cells from 1 devil get into another devil these cells can cause tumours in the new host. These are very scary but fortunately very rare in humans.

t3_7ug4pb	1	*	Cancer vaccine eliminates tumors in mice - 90 of 90 mice cured of cancers with lymphoma, similar results observed in colon, breast, and melanoma cancers.. This is very good for mice.. Mice are different from humans, but are highly genetically similar. According to the article, The current clinical trial is expected to recruit about 15 patients with low-grade lymphoma. We will see how it goes in humans, but this is very encouraging progress for the field of cancer research.. It has occurred to me that since they can grow muscle now in the process of making lab grown meat, maybe they could grow human muscles in the same manner, and use that medium to grow tumors in, upon which to test this method of targeting tumors in humans first.  Even better than using lab animals.. The problem with that is cancer cells require constant nutrients and it interacts in a living system. With cancer cells cultured in plates, they need to be in a specific media (liquid broth containing nutrients) that is changed regularly. In mice or other living animals, they get nutrients from a circulatory system and other neighboring cells.. I'm trying to inoculate mushroom mycelium on agar in my basement. Growing cancer sounds hard.. It really isnt that hard.. you put them in a Petri dish and fill it with a liquid that has all the nutrients they need in it (you buy it pre made) and then put them in a little incubator and wait for them to grow. You have to change the liquid every couple of days though. Also this needs to be done in sterile conditions or bacteria will get it and outcompete the cancer cells. Did this guy just cure cancer?. I mean yes, usually people are not trying to cure cancer of things that will kill it so much as trying to cure the people who have cancer though...  If that was already the joke, I'm sorry

Trudeau never *ever* claimed to be anti-pipeline.   And in fairness to him, he has introduced a national climate-change plan (which includes a carbon tax, a phasing out of coal power plants, and a bunch of other stuff), so its not like hes done nothing on that front.. No, but he promised to do more to respect and represent first nations, who were very adamantly against this pipeline.. Some were against it, for sure. But as Prime Minister, Trudeau has to take into account the interests of *everybody* in the country. Much of the Alberta economy is based around the oil industry, which isnt gonna disappear overnight.. There are a lot of people that are against the pipeline, primarily because tar sands are the most damaging form of oil in the world, and he's still pushing us as a green nation.  Very hypocritical.. There are a lot of people in favour of the pipeline also. It's only hypocritical if he said he'll shut it down and didn't.

We are exporting about 60% of our exports to one country, and 20% of our GDP comes from eporting to that one country.  We need to diversify, and this will help us do it.. Why would you not be concerned about what's in it?  I mean, if it's great, then why wouldn't reading it just confirm to us that it's great and that we should do it?. I trust our political and economic elites to look out for me, the little guy. They would never want to profit at my expense, because it's me, the little guy.  If I can't trust a technocratic elite, then who CAN I trust?!. They are called elected representatives, and representing  out interests is literally their joba.

t3_7sg8de	1	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. Let me guess... now without all those compromises that the US insisted on.. Out of the loop here... What were the compromises?. IP (Intellectual Property) provisions are suspended.  Investor-state dispute settlement was kinda dismantled.  More worker rights.  More environmental protections.. Without ISDS, how do they resolve disputes?. Investor state dispute settlement is really only needed if you can't trust the governments' courts to fairly handle a claim against that government.  . So theyre needed then. Why are you putting words in his mouth?  Why do you think a secondary check is needed on the courts of sovereign lands?. Not all countries have well functioning judiciaries. Just because they're sovereign doesn't mean they aren't corrupt.  Its pretty obvious why you wouldn't want to invest in a country that can then pull the rug out from under you, leaving you with no legal recourse. Thats why ISDS's are necessary.

I haven't heard anything about that. . Guessing he's talking about the goddamn milk farmers upset at the prospect of us getting real cheese from Europe. I kind of think protecting our dairy industry is a good thing. I worry about Canadian markets getting flooded with American milk products. American milk is cheaper than ours, but they don't have the same safety regulations for the animals or the consumers. Some companies give their cows BGH down there, which is bad for everyone involved. :(. The market will work itself out. If American milk is inferior the market will favour local. If the American product is a better value, then our local industry needs to adjust.. unfortunately American farmers pumped too much milk and now have to be subsidized by the american tax payer. Since Canadians don't pay the subsidy, milk products look cheaper.. You make that sound bad.  Get Americans to pay tax to reduce the price of milk in Canada?  That would be great for Canadian consumers.

t3_7sg8de	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. Trudeau is a complete fucking idiot. We need to get rid of that fuckwit. Na I hope Canada keeps him in office for a long time. With the US cutting tax and regulation it wont be long till we get all your Canadian companies.   . You're right. Us western provinces want to join the US . I reside in one of those, and most of us are really, really glad we aren't the US at the moment.. They have a leader that's working for them, we have one that's working against us . That is entirely a political judgement, and not one shared by the majority of Canadians in any province, if you look at Trudeau's favourables vs. Trump's.. You think government polls mean anything? When you poll certain people in a small area you can severely skew the numbers. I think that properly conducted opinion polling is a completely valid way to measure the mood of the public, particularly when it shows very wide differences well outside the margin of error.

So first were taking all your trade, and now were sucking your teat?   Guess you dont need your #1 supplier of oil anymore.. It was a response to the post... The post implies that Canada is abandoning The United States. . We are moving away from the US. With CETA, and now this, were trying to diversify away from the US in trade.   Mostly in response to how the US tries to fuck us over all the time in Lumber, Dairy, and aerospace design. We also dont want to be dependent on a country in where an administration such as Trumps could come in and do massive damage to our trade relations (such as disbanding NAFTA)   . Absolutely! All countries should take care of themselves first. If we dont learn to do that, we will fail. . All countries can't do that.   Natural resource deposits aren't evenly distributed. . Then that means that some countries will be poorer than others. . No, that means they'll move somewhere else.   
t3_7sg8de	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. As a Canadian I'm pretty concerned with what is in the new TPP. I hope the full text is released before it's too late to reneg on it.. As a Canadian I'm not.  We as a country need to be trading with more countries that are not the USA and in bigger volumes.  We are exporting about 60% of our exports to one country, and 20% of our GDP comes from eporting to that one country.  We need to diversify, and this will help us do it.. Why would you not be concerned about what's in it?  I mean, if it's great, then why wouldn't reading it just confirm to us that it's great and that we should do it?. I trust our political and economic elites to look out for me, the little guy. They would never want to profit at my expense, because it's me, the little guy.  If I can't trust a technocratic elite, then who CAN I trust?!. They are called elected representatives, and representing  out interests is literally their joba. And every draft of the TPP is very public and you can read it any time if you actually gave a shit . > representing out interests is literally their jobs  It's a shame that they are so shit at their jobs.  . They get paid more to do someone else's bidding. I'd do the same, to be honest. Give me enough money and I'll say whatever the fuck you want me to say.. Then you'd be a douche, and you'd be doing a terrible job.  Some people actually value the service they provide more than the money they get in return, and they would be doing a much better job than you would.

We have this thing called democracy the American people have spoken you don't like I suggest you take it to the polls in 2020. Insulting the president and his base isn't going to change anything maybe try to persuade others into your political perspective. calling him dotard isn't a very progressive thing to do.. You asked about the Anti-American sentiment that is common here. He explained it. No need to be a bitch about it.. You missed one little detail he isn't American. democracy the protest that actually makes a difference! America isn't perfect but I'm very grateful that I was born here and not some other countries. the downvotes prove my original point lol.

You're obviously a leader and know so much about change and how much we're hurting ourself.  You do it, man!  Let's go!. Regressing is not the answer, neither is blaming people. subsidizing education, and accurately pricing pollution into production, are probably the relevant goals.. Did you read the actual paper?. I did now, it managed to be pretty scary, even without mentioning the whole methane permafrost thing. I still think the most effective goals are education and accurately pricing pollution into production. That is how we create the problem solvers and finance their solutions.. I'm still trying to figure out how 1-3 degrees could do so much.  I've read a lot of papers and they all have ideas, theories, assumptions but they all conclude basically, this is what's happening and this is what's going on as this happened / is happening so they conclude, these two must be related.    Then all it would take is a massive volcanic eruption and it's another ice age.     . It turns the frogs gay.. ha ha ha ha ha!

You may want to ask the person who purchased it. . I'd like to ask the one who sold it for proof that they made renovations worth $60 million dollars and if that money went to pay for his bankruptcies and if he knew the Russian's intention to tear the property drown. Because it looks like he's a willing participant to launder money.. You ever sold a property before?  You and the buyer rarely cross paths.  The buyer either has the money to purchase the property or they don't.  If there is any laundering going on it's on the behalf of the buyer not the seller.. You really trying to pass off the idea that Donald never met with the Russian willing to give him $60 mil for no real reason?. You don't believe He had people to do that? That he would meet personally with every perspective buyer of ever property he sells

Geez I dont know why everyone doesnt buy foreclosed homes! They always go for 60% discount. Guaranteed to make 2.5x your purchase price immediately after payment. . The reason everyone doesn't - is because most can't. Banks do not allow you to take out a mortgage or borrow to buy a foreclosed property. Therefore it limits the foreclosure market to people with large sums of available cash.

You don't think its suspicious to sell a property for over twice its value? If a $ $100,000 speaking fee for Clinton rubs you the wrong way, this should too. . You're comparing paying the Clintons, who have been in politics almost their entire life, speaking fees (they went from $250,000 - $500,000 just to hear them talk for an hour) to a private businessman, who wouldn't get into politics until ~10 years later, selling something tangible that can be resold for a profit?. I'm using Clinton's speaking fees as a point of reference for something that they conservative right has often claimed as overvalued and dubious. It is a way to point out a flaw in the internal logic of the person I responded to. . You're comparing the payments given to politicians for something intangible, to the payment to a non-politician for selling something tangible to try and point out some flawed logic. Those two examples are not comparable at all.. This assumes that the extra $60 million was for something tangible. The implication in the article is that there was a possible quid pro quo between Trump and the Russian buyer, which could very well have been something intangible given to Trump.  . Tangible things have values that appreciate or depreciate over time. They also can be have their value change based on what the owner does to that item before they sell it.   It's absurd to think someone would bribe a business man for the politics he would get into 10 years in the future. . Or it was just old fashioned money laundering. A quid pro quo does not have to be about US politics alone. I'm not saying either of those things happened, just that the sale is suspicious.

But volunteering by foreigners itself is not illegal, they just ruled the travel stipend provided to them by the Australian Labor Party amounted to compensation which isnt allowed. They were fined 14K. Seems a minor infraction that youre trying to equate with the Russian interference.. I never equated it. Simply pointed out your bias. A minor infraction? Illegal campaign financing is a minor infraction now? Im sorry, the fact that you seem totally cool with other countries interfering with US elections as long as its for your guy makes you just as the Trump apologists.

Just because youve eaten shit, doesnt make the dirt you previously had better taste better.. Then again, *relatively speaking*, dirt isn't as bad as shit.. Well, the orange shit still havent started any wars or made a huge impact on the world besides every other country making fun of the US president.. I'd say denying manmade climate change and actively trying to obstruct the advancement of renewable energy (albeit unstoppable) is kinda impactful.. How is that different from Bush?
t3_7sn266	1	*	Many in Europe wish to punish the UK for leaving the EU, says Luxembourg finance minister. Pity we didn't let the Germans punish the rest of Europe over half a century ago.. The UK by itself was pretty powerless to *stop* Nazi Germany doing what it wanted in continental Europe at that time.... Couldn't invade Britain though could they ?. No, but that didn't really help France, Belgium, Norway or the Netherlands very much.. My point is seeing as they want to punish us now, we should have left them with a German jackboot on their throat.. My point is that the UK made very little difference to the jackbooting most of Europe received.  It's fair to say that *some* in Europe may well want to punish the UK for leaving the EU. It's also fair to say that, if Brexit has negative consequences for the UK - which it will - it will be seen by *some* in the UK as punishment by the EU rather than self-flagellation - which it is.. Britain fought alone til 1942. And these negative consequences,what are they exactly?. Did it liberate Europe alone? Is Europe to be forever in its debt because the UK defended its island?  The loss of scientific research funding is most pertinent negative consequence. Labour shortages in certain industries another. UK citizens being poorer by most measurements.

Yeah ISIS is bad blah blah  The point is : distribution of violent images is strictly regulated in France, she broke the law, end of the story.. Love how you are okay with not talking about ISIS when they burnt people alive.  Thats such a stupid law, maybe thats why Europeans are so weak and fragile because their babied their whole lives and dont realize that dangers of the world.. Why so fragile ? lmao  >Thats such a stupid law  I believe protecting people (especially the young) against violent images is good.

Please explain to me why you think that Le Pen's tweets were not protected by French law, or even better why you think she is innocent of  prosecution  . Again. France might jail someone for tweeting. I never said that her speech is protected by french law.. IT CLEARLY ISNT!. >France might jail someone for tweeting  Again proving the point you have no idea what you are talking about.

How would you feel if a journalist publicly compared you to people who do what is shown in those images? And how would you respond?. Oh I'd be mad too - I am simply voicing that I think she is a piece of shit in general.. For any action discussed in this topic, or just because you couldnt contain sharing an irrelevant negative opinion?. Not sure I understand the question. I answered his questions. That seems pretty straight forward.   I am not saying I am mad about getting downvoted, ifg that's what you're asking?  Edit; Ah I think I get it. No, that opinion were both for here and in general.. I was asking why you needed to voice that opinion: was it in response to anything relevant to the topic at hand, or just a random post I hate that person.. In case you didn't see my edit; It was sort of irrelevant byproduct of the bile that builds in me when I see her smug face.

I mean, she doesn't support Isis, right? Or does she? I hate her but I don't get these attempt to stop speech. Unless it's incitement. Is it?. Whats wrong with pointing out that ISIS is evil?. families of the victims don't necessarily want to see the blood bath. Should we not be allowed to show photos of the holocaust, because the families of the victims might not want those shown? . families of the victims of the holocausts want them to be shown, because some people pretend it never happened.

Well, Le Pen is neither a journalist nor is she being held to the American version of free speech Donalds, as it appears you think is the case.. Or any free speech apparently. What's she getting charged with? As an American this is unthinkable to me. It seems entirely reasonable to me. Every nation doesn't need to adhere to broad speech laws like America any more than they need to copy our extremely strict nudity and profanity restrictions for broadcast tv.. I didn't say they need too. Europe can do whatever the fuck it wants.   I'd fight the suppression of ideas in the US tooth and nail tho.   That being said, once again, Europe can do its thing, we can do ours. My point is that we are extremely different cultures.. So your previous comment was nonsense. You seem to have a firm grasp on the situation rather than it being unthinkable.. Not really... Getting arrested for stating a belief is unthinkable since I come from the US. I have a firm grasp on the concept, doesn't mean the implementation of that isn't unthinkable. . > Getting arrested for stating a belief  Think you're commenting on the wrong thread. This article is about someone being charged with posting the mangled body of a person on their twitter by retweeting an ISIS propaganda account.

That's how it always is though, isn't it? You stop anyone on the street and ask who was involved with the Moon landing, and they'll likely only know Buzz Aldrin or Neil Armstrong. Of course their were many important people involved that didn't get near the amount of attention.. What exactly do you think an astronaut does?. Space stuff, I dunno.. Astronauts are far from just the face of their missions. They're highly vetted and highly trained pilots who risked their lives for exploration, and in several cases lost their lives. To compare them to a man who bankrolls and not much else is to diminish their sacrifices.. I know this. They're also popular among the general public verses the engineers that stay on Earth. They are both highly skilled and highly popular. . Because they earned it. There was a very real chance they would die every time they went into space. When Elon pilots his own rocket ship, then it'll be a fair comparison. . I disagree. Flying to the moon is brave. Starting a car company and a rocket company with less than 10% success rate is impressive. I admire both.

I agree it is a team effort - however - if there was no Elon Musk to put it ALL on the line at the beginning do you think there would be a space X and reusable vehicles ?. if we could get proper funding for nasa research? most likely, yeah. . NASA's problem is that it has to appease politicians to fly. Scientifically, NASA is top notch, but operationally they are a lumbering giant.. yeah, which does present plenty of issues. but having the future of our space program be in the hands of a semi-egomaniac capitalist who doesn't have a great track record in terms of respecting labor doesn't exactly make me happy either.. I think Musk views his labor as more important than better treatment of labor.  To get an Earth 2.0 ASAP to him is more important than somewhat overworking his talent.  I can understand that reasoning.. Y'all are projecting way too much. Musk isn't this philanthropic genius out to save the world, he's a businessman . He can be a visionary and a businessman, he just happened to build businesses to bring his vision to life.
t3_7vqgon	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. Succes Even though they lost a main core, reminds me of how they said the last one that failed completely was a partial success. The goal was to launch a payload into orbit. Everything else was a bonus. They succeeded in achieving the mission parameters. . What else is on board? I haven't read much about this. A car, a dummy in a SpaceX spacesuit, and a towel. There's a sign that says Don't Panic and it was playing Space Oddity. . Nice! Why a towel?. It's the most important item a hitchhiker can have!. Ahh. I've never read it. I own it though . It's definitely my favorite fiction book series. I've read them all something like 7 times.
t3_7vqgon	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. I am here for the Core. . Do they have a recovery team nearby to recover it if it missed?. They'll recover it for forensic purposes to see what failed and what could fail, but it's unflyable after soaking in salt water.. And if it hit at 300mph, it's unflyable from disintegrating.. Yeah but mostly just the salt water. The salt water definitely makes gluing all the little pieces back together more difficult.    But after today I believe they can pull off just about anything =). How did NASA recover the shuttle boosters since those got soaked?. Floated back via a recovery barge, usually. And an almost complete rebuild. 
t3_7vqgon	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. The simultaneous touchdown of the boosters might be one of the most beautiful things I've seen. That might be one of the best launches I've ever seen and I've seen the shuttle go up live in Canaveral. Do we know if the core made it?  I still can't believe that of all the payloads, Musk threw his car into space.  Edit: Core did not make it. . It was extremely satisfying.  Even if the drone ship landing failed, the amount of success that this test launch brought makes me unbelievably optimistic and giddy for the future of space exploration, AND that we may actually see some AMAZING advancements in our lifetimes.

[Don't miss the LIVE video feed from the car!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBr2kKAHN6M). Thanks!  So amazing...  Is this going to mars or is it just orbiting Earth?. Its staying in earth orbit for 6 hours to prove a point to the military, then moving into something called a Hohmann transfer: an orbit around the sun that crosses both Earths and Mars orbits. Sadly, it will not actually be going to Mars, just heading out close to it (in relative space terms) then orbiting the Sun for a billion years or so.. What point is being proven?. I guess that it can put something in orbit? Im not really sure, but Ive heard that the military is hoping to put satellites up with it so they might want proof that it works.. Probably cold engine restart.  Its something that spacex hasn't demonstrated until now.

It's more distracting to go off on a tangent about why it was included rather than having a discussion about what should be done with countries who interfere in foreign elections.

NO COLLUSION.  YOU'RE COLLUSION.. Does Russia meddling with other countries make it a bad country?  Because boy do I have some stories for you about the U.S. and South America.... It's an act of war, imo. Doesn't matter whether or not it's wrong, it's a direct effort to undermine your country, you're kind of obligated to bomb the shit out of them. Russia's just calling everyone's bluffs, because they realize total war isn't going to be a thing any time soon.. TIL half of the world should be at war with the USA. Thats some expert-level geopolitical analysis there.  Now, can you explain to the class reasons why countries *wouldn't* want go to War with the US?. Uhh, because the US has the largest military strength of any country in the world, has enough firepower to destroy the entire world three times over, and can easily face off the rest of the world combined with its Navy alone?  I'm not American, by the way. It's just simple logic.

The US, for all its (significant) faults, guarantees freedom to its citizens and, albeit with significant exceptions, its allies. Russia is an oligarchy: you're on their side or you get run over. One can compare methodologies and faults of each but at the end of the day there's no comparison. One is better for everyone involved.

Just because US has been interfering with elections doesn't mean it's somehow ok for Russia to interfere. If anything it just means both countries should be criticized for meddling in foreign affairs. . And yet only one of those two has been criticized. You have to be going out of your way to ignore the mountains of criticism the US gets for its meddling in other countries politics.  Maybe the average person in the street never pays it much attention, but for people who are interested in international politics its not at all some hidden secret.. There's also the fact that US interventions are ostensibly for international stability, whereas Russian interventions are meant to destabilize and weaken international coalitions. . Yep America definitely stabilised North Africa and the Middle East with the Arab spring and its intervention in Libya. They didnt purposely destabilise every country a pipeline from Saudi Arabia to Turkey would run through.

The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries  its done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.  From LA Times. So, why is Russia's meager attempt to do the same news?. Because Russian has annexed two major regions in the last decade. No one likes them.. And that has anything to do with election meddling.. how, exactly?. I believe you quest was why is Russia's meager attempt to do the same news?   And my answer, was because people don't really like Russia right now, because they annexed two countries. Making people pay more attention to what they do. . Correction: they annexed two small pieces of two countries. If they annexed two whole countries, there'd be more fuss I think.  But yeah, thanks for the answer.

I was in Puerto Rico in December to go on a cruise, and talked a bit to the cab driver while I was there, he said he felt the media had let them down. There was so much sensationalism of the hurricane and the damage, but they all left when they needed help the most and the news cycle continued without help getting to where it needed to be and they felt abandoned . Not the medias fault. People knew about it, if people wanted to stay up to date on Puerto Ricos status they could have followed it easily.  Lay blame where it belongs, with this Administration.  Edit: Apparently people think the media is the government now.. The Administration doesn't control the media though and this fellow felt abandoned by the media.. They don't control it but they can easily  direct it to the topic that needs to be discussed. Instead, we see more tweets about football players or threats against North Korea.. This is nonsense, the media is completely independent of the administration and make up their own minds on what to report.. Yes, and they most definitely report on the decisions and direction that the administration takes. Because that's their job.  Not their fault the direction wasn't in Puerto Rico. . > they most definitely report on the decisions and direction that the administration takes.  Of course they do, but that's not all they report on.  Obviously the media doesn't solely report on what the administration is doing, so for all the time they are talking about everything else in the world they could choose to talk about Puerto Rico.

Just google it and you'll see. . Ah, thanks. I knew it was pretty quick, just a bit peeved it took this long for Puerto Rico, when it was so fast for a country that's been effectively blockaded for the last 50 years.. Cubas power grid was/is in much better shape than PR's. They also have amazing island wide emergency response, especially when it comes to hurricanes. They can drop power lines to avoid damage and make repair after the storm easier. . You would think most islands located in hurricane ally would have the same response, as if they were all dealing with it for... IDK forever?. PR's govt is notoriously corrupt.  The US gave them money years ago to upgrade their grid, and they blew it all away, laid off linemen, and did even less maintenance.. That doesn't sound corrupt. That sounds like a well run business to me.. Haha you are right for many of them.  But when they fuck up, they generally cant get the govt to step in and fix everything.
t3_7wwmc7	0	*	Electricity restored to 75 percent of customers in Puerto Rico.. This just in:  >Explosion sets off a big fire at a main power substation in northern Puerto Rico, causing blackout. -https://apnews.com/4b49c25c3cc94a8aba57acb90c99a685/Blackout-hits-northern-Puerto-Rico-following-fire,-explosion?. Can we just make them a state after all this? Poor bastards.. Every 10 years PR votes on the issue. Last time they voted to stay a territory.. What are the benefits of that situation?  Genuinely asking, I have no clue the pros and cons of statehood. . the OP is wrong.  The citizens of PR voted for statehood.  Congress denied it to them. https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/09/us/puerto-rico-statehood-vote-2017/index.html. Only 22% of the population voted so doesn't seem very legitimate. . I mean, roughly 1/3 of ~~eligible voters~~ the population votes in the presidential election (less in primaries and midterms) and effectively 1/6 decide who gets to be the leader of the US. So being just above 1/5 doesn't seem that big of a deal. ~16% deciding who gets to be the president doesn't seem very legitimate either, yeah?. Where is this lie on Reddit coming from? I've seen it multiple times and its incredibly easy to disprove with the most cursory of google searches  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/voter-turnout-2016-elections  turnout for the 2016 president election was 59.6% Not somewhere around 33!

I knew it was pretty quick, just a bit peeved it took this long for Puerto Rico, when it was so fast for a country that's been effectively blockaded for the last 50 years.. Isnt the delay in PR largely due to the lack of maintenance and care for the old grid in the first place? Maybe Cubas grid was in better shape before it was damaged?  Just my guess . It likely was, as public services are high on Cuba's list of important stuff.. Cant have a revolution if people are happy with what you're doing *taps head with finger*. Also the Cubans probably have a smaller grid because not many people are allowed to use the internet and use less electricity than the average Puerto Rican.. It's not that they aren't allowed to use the internet. It's too expensive for most people to have in their homes right now. Most of them get wifi cards and can use it at public hotspots. 
t3_7wwmc7	1	*	Electricity restored to 75 percent of customers in Puerto Rico.. Flint Michigan still doesnt have clean water!!!. Actually, Flint michigan water is now above safe drinking standards.  https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/01/water-flint-now-officially-safe-drink/  The problem is now people need their pipes in their homes fixed, as that was the problem to begin with.  Since they are in poverty, it likely won't occur. . Actually no amount of lead is really considered safe. Its just below the legal limits.. > no amount of lead is really considered safe  I mean, that seems kind of misleading. At some point the concentration is going to be so low that it'll be insignificant.. > EPAs position is there is no safe level of lead exposure.  - Joel Beauvais, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. So one atom of lead per glass of water is unsafe? :p  (Very exaggerated, but you get the point). You cant really detect one atom. I think the more accurate statement would be that no *detectable* amount of lead is considered safe. . Yes, that's a better way of putting it

Considering these planets are 3.8 billion light years away, there's a pretty good chance we won't get there in a millennium or two.. Fold it over and put a pencil through it - voila !. If only movie science worked. spaceship with blackhole engine. trust me on this. I'm sorry, but any unseasoned plan for faster than light space travel just isn't going to work.. See, we know space is expanding which means it can be manipulated, we just have to figure out how to move space faster than light and we will be there in no time.  /s. You say this with sarcasm, but just 500 years ago the fastest way from Spain to Bahamas was like, 2 months by boat. Google tells me it takes 19 hours with one layover now. Although, I do believe once you get down to atomic hard limits, it gets pretty iffy on breaking them.
t3_7wsf01	0	*	George Soros 'proud' of donating xa3400,000 to anti-Brexit campaign, says his affection for UK prompted decision, and leaving EU would leave it weaker.. So confusing. . .  Russians can't even post comments on social media without being accused of meddling in other countries' democratic processes, but somehow Soros can give xa3400,000 to stop Brexit and not be called a meddler, despite his lack of UK citizenship.  Such a strange world.. You're confusing a transparent donation from a private citizen with a shadowy disinformation campaign conducted by a nation-state.  And really... anyone who continues to deny Russian election interference at this point has exactly as much credibility as a flat-earther.. And yet here is a wealthy foreigner openly meddling in internal British democratic processes, seeking to reverse a vote by the British people  and actually **bragging** about it in public  and the folks who scream about Russian election interference are oddly silent.  Hypocrisy much?. Wait... you're *doubling down* on trying to compare someone's personal donation to *fucking Russia*?  I have a feeling this is going to be an exhausting rabbit hole of partisan fantasies, and I really just don't have the energy to go down it with you. Hard pass.. So would you be ok if a russian oligarch donated some money?. That's a pretty vague question, but yes, assuming it was public and legal. Because the politician who accepted that money would then be held accountable by the citizenry. And if the citizenry was not in favor of Russian influence on their election, they would *act* civically and electorally (if not take to the streets).  This is kind of the whole idea of democracy.. It won't be to a politician just like Soros' donation.. What you've just described is even less shady. This reverse whataboutism you guys are trying is super weird. 
t3_7wsf01	1	*	George Soros 'proud' of donating xa3400,000 to anti-Brexit campaign, says his affection for UK prompted decision, and leaving EU would leave it weaker.. Money out of politics would be best for all of us, left or right.. It's not really the money that's the problem so much as it's the lack of transparency and accountability, the lack of integrity in propagandistic media, and the lack of political/civic education amongst voters.. Nah, it's the money.  Neither ideas nor people should be bought and paid for.   Prioritizing capitalism over democracy is a fast-track to a dystopia.. Just look at the US as example of why mixing money and politics is bad.. Ending Citizens United needs to be a primary plank on the democratic platform.. It was in 2016 . But Hillary was basically a republican /s. Right that's why they love her so much.

Actually, he has come up with 4 indictments and an investigation so complex and global in nature could take years.  You have no idea how many sealed subpenas there are that are sealed ready to go, keep hoping..... 4 indictments with no underlying crime. It's a farce, just like the non stop Hillary investigations.. Lying to the FBI is not a crime?. Like I said, no underlying crime. Lying to the FBI is a crime, but they're not lying about another crime. its literally pulling a Bill Clinton impeachment.. Keep saying that:  No collusion, It's Hillary's fault, Trump is a stable genius!. I didn't vote for either. I have no dog in the fight. If you noticed, I also criticized the constant Hillary investigations.. The fact that you have no dog in the fight says volumes!

Its been over a year all they have is nothing.. No that is not what an indictment is...You left out what it is an accusation of.  A CRIME!  It is the FBI accusing you of a CRIME!. Sorry an accusation that is leading to legal proceedings. But still. No guilty parties. . Do you seriously think it is over, or that Mueller will come up empty-handed?. Largely yes. Im just waiting for the clinton investigation. . Let me know how that plays out, to think the trumps will walk away from this Scott-Free is such cognitive dissonance...

Ooh, i can play this game too! You can't tell us what to do because you practically genocided the whole continent.. To be clear, the Spanish genocided most of the continent.  . what about the native americans? or black people or japanese people. i think trump has the best attitude towards this, he's just like fuck it and fuck you, america #1.. Well, the native Americans were genocided before the United States was a thing.  That's on the Europeans (mostly).  And Europe also took out their share of black and brown people, the dutch would pretty much murder islands of natives for spices.  I'm not sure what you are referring to regarding the Japanese. . Actually European diseases killed 90% of the Native population, and almost all of it was unintentional (ie, the deed had been done before the first small pox blanket was given).   There really wasnt much left for anyone to genocide.     Theres a reason settlers completely took over the land unlike India, Africa or China, they had an unknown lead blocker in America. . > Theres a reason settlers completely took over the land unlike India, Africa or China, they had an unknown lead blocker in America.   actually not at all, that has everything to do with India/China/Africa being far more powerful agricultural societies with bigger numbers.    . Actually yes, those bigger numbers dont count for shit if everyone is dying and no one knows why.

Ah, US forces rendition, torture, assignations, overthrows democratic elected govs, invades countries it knows did nothing because profit... etc etc. all these things are fact, not opinion, so its probably not a good idea to compare thuggery or assassination with the USA.. you replied to a post on whataboutism with whataboutism?. Whataboutism is a term used to attempt to derail valid comparison. There is no such thing as whataboutism.. that's pretty awesome how you can just deny basic terminology and real concepts, and decide you will just construct your own ignorant alternative reality, and think you still matter . Please find me a reference to whataboutism from more than about a year. Or find it in a textbook.

The average person doesn't care enough to shift their opinion to 'we're as bad as that country that we think is bad'. I agree with u/mraker900. I think they're saying essentially the same thing. Russians can't look to the US for a functioning democracy, it's all cheats and puppets. So instead of striving for better, they are led to believe this is the way of the world, which makes Russians feel better that they aren't alone in this shit pit. They are in a much deeper shit pit, not the same one at all.. . The same one of oligarchy and corruption. The fact that there is corruption and outsized influence for the wealthy in every society does not mean that those problems are of the same degree in every society, far from it.

It was much better orchestrated to appear that it wasn't, but anyone who was there would agree that it slowly died out because the Police presence was able to kill the movement.  . [The banks used federal agencies and resources like the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the police to target leaders and dismantle the occupy movement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement#National_monitoring_and_crackdown) The references also list the many mass arrests.. All true and not to be overlooked, but with or without, this movement was dead. It lost it's popular support, and not because of the banks, but because it had no resonant or coherent message, and a bunch of hardcore Leftists overtook it and started pushing economically illiterate agendas.. I think the left's economic agenda of fair pay, demand side stimulating programs and working class protections are far more coherent than the right wing's Give rich peple moar monies and it'll trickle down on dah peasants agenda..

Exactly, if they want to pull that card then almost no one needs to shut the fuck up more than them. . It doesn't matter at this point, they got the headline. Like when Trump slams someone on Twitter in a transparent attempt to discredit them. Even if it's proven false the base sees it. Literally everything Trump says is something he should shut the fuck up about because hypocrisy. But he still says it because it works. . I secretly think its like WWE where they all talk shit to each other publicly but privately get together and watch all the news and laugh about it. Its not like any of them will ever be in mortal danger. They send their poor to die for them, which they probably also find amusing or they wouldn't keep doing it over their petty bullshit.. Why don't presidents fight the war? Why do they always send the poor?. George Washington fought the  war, George Washington fought alongside the poor!. Yeah but tbf I heard he had like 30 goddamn dicks. . Either you or I had a severely fucked up history teacher.
t3_7nug5w	0	*	Russia Says US Can't Criticize Iran Because It Crushed Occupy Wall Street and Ferguson. By that logic, how can Russia criticize the US, exactly?. I don't think they are saying 'we are better than you', more 'you are as bad as the rest of us'. This is literally whataboutism as it was created. It's a Russian propaganda tool meant to claim everywhere else is just as bad to make their own horrible things look better by comparison.  Edit: lots of oddly defensive comments about Russia below. It's weird. Stop reading now.. Don't you get it? If you live in Russia you would find the US hypocritical, just like we find Russia being hypocritical. The average person doesn't care enough to shift their opinion to 'we're as bad as that country that we think is bad'. I agree with u/mraker900. I think they're saying essentially the same thing. Russians can't look to the US for a functioning democracy, it's all cheats and puppets. So instead of striving for better, they are led to believe this is the way of the world, which makes Russians feel better that they aren't alone in this shit pit. we're more like how can a country with no history and tons of racial/lgbt  problems judge us.. Yeah, here in Russia we kill our gays!  There is no moral equivalency between the US and Russia. . how no idea why US so fixated on gays, but u can check, there are severasl open gays in russian media bussiness, nobody kills them, and people go to their concerts.

Not long ago all the homosexuals mysteriously vanished. Nice try though, rakesh. interesting how you move the goalposts.  we're comparing Grozny to Iraq here..

Whataboutism. I may be in the wrong, but you are in no position to criticize me if you are in fact lynching negroes. Its not a philosophical debate, its pointing out hypocrisy.. Of course I'd be. If I say 3+2 = 6 and you say 2+2 = 5 it doesn't make you less wrong if I call you out, it makes us both wrong. . Yes, but youd be a hypocrite to do so. A serial killer is in no position to call out the moral failings of a speeder.. That is true, I'd be a hypocrite, but that doesn't make 2+2 = 5 less wrong. The fact that someone else acts unethical doesn't give anyone the right to be unethical too, which is what whataboutism is about.   It doesn't matter who calls someone out, said someone is still wrong regardless. . Again, its not a philosophical justification which makes it not a fallacy. Im not implying that Im in the right, Im implying that youre acting hypocritical.  If you can call me out for being in the wrong, cant I do the same thing to you? Perhaps were both wrong.

If you want pure, unadultered capitalism, I would suggest moving to Russia. . Dude Russia is not pure unadultered capitalism, for one they got a public healthcare system and spend a lot on welfare programs, corruption, and nepotism are rampant, you have to pay off government officials to get anything done, Russia is nowhere near having a free market economy, the US is by far more capitalistic then Russia

I hate everything that has to do with Feminism... but I love this, Sweden is awesome.. You don't hate everything to do with feminism if you like fathers getting paternity leave. That's an issue a lot of feminists are fighting for.. I look at it as a egalitarian move, I'm all for giving people choices. I have rarely seen feminists fight for something that is positive for men, but however you choose to look at it. If this isn't a Meninist policy, I don't know what is. . Feminism is an egalitarian movement.. Egalitarianism is an egalitarian movement, feminism acts on the presupposition that women are oppressed which is an idea closely related to dialectical materialism.. Egalitarianism isn't a movement, it's a belief and one that a majority of feminists believe.. That is why I am a egalitarian, because so few of today's third-wave postmodern feminists are actually egalitarian. Thank you! Have a great day!. A majority of third-wave feminists are egalitarian.

I'm saying they are capable, and I'm not saying that they would be fighting someone comparable in Syria, just that they are not beyond foreign intervention. . > I'm saying they are capable,  No they aren't. For one they fought a small number of poorly trained insurgents in Mali, not an army. Two they needed US support to even get there.. > No they aren't.  They have one of the top 5 military's in the world. After the first 2 there is a real big drop off. And no they are not capable. They couldn't even keep a simple bombing campaign of Libya going for 2 weeks.. they weren't ready at the time not because they weren't capable but because they didn't stockpile the needed munitions. France is completely capable of invading and holding Syria if they prepare for it financially.

The vile Taliban, originally a product of Saudi Wahabist ideology and money, facilitated through Pakistani intelligence and Pakistani ultra religious brainwashing schools (the 'Madrassas). Madrasas is just the Arabic and farsi word for school. Madrasas are islamist indoctrination schools, thousands across the globe financed by Saudi Arabia to spread Wahabbism . Madrassa means school. Mudarris is teacher. Neither necessarily relates to terrorism. The American news media in their ignorance created tha association. It is not true.. I mean...arent a majority of universities and schools in the Islamic world teaching strictly theocracy? Like...muslims go to school to study how to he better muslims...no wonder theyre so obssed with religion.. The word for University is Jamiya madrassa is primary school, if I recall correctly. Im sure religion is a big part of it, but what Im saying is that this does not equate to creating and training jihadis. There may be a subset of madrassas that do this, but I would be extremely hesitant to say there are enough to justify the association madrassa= terrorist school.. Sure it's just the Arabic word for something. But that's the issue...by and large the Arab world isn't trusted when it comes to even just their daily culture. . Yeah Im not following. If you want to make an association between maddrassa and terrorism you can go ahead. But if one is trying to target a terrorisr training camp, then doing so by examining all things labeled madrassas is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

t3_7rdwxs	0	*	Trudeau bans anti-abortion groups from summer jobs funding. This is wrong. Shit like this is why his approval rating is dropping.  EDIT: This isn't about being pro or anti abortion, it's the fact he is punishing people for having a different opinion than him. . He's saying the gov't won't fund groups that are advocating taking rights away from people. That's not a radical decision. They can do as they please, they just won't get gov't funding.. But whether abortion is a right or not is a matter of opinion though, I'm personally pro-choice myself but I also think that people should have the right to protest whatever they like. Punishing groups of people for politically incorrect and conservative views is still wrong, governments shouldn't play favourites with groups of tax-paying citizens. . Nobody is blocking your right to protest or hold that belief. You just won't get gov't handouts to do so.   That goes for protesting any charter right/freedom.. So presumably you'd be in favor of the govt doing this for anti gun protestors too right? . CANADA. NOT STATES. Gun's aren't part of our constitution. And I don't see any anti-gun groups out protesting in canada because we actually have gun control that's pretty strict.. I know, but you currently have a right to own them don't you? . Nope. not that I know of. You apply for a permit to do so. And handguns are even more restricted, with snub-nosed and others prohibited that you can only get through inheritance.

Unless you believe that a baby can be aborted up until it comes out of the womb, the issue is not that simple.  . I do and it is.. News Flash: A fetus is an actual life. It's a potential *newborn,* the same way a newborn is a potential toddler, and so on. . then i hope you never masturbate, because thats a potential embryo, which is a potential fetus, which is then a potential newborn, which is then a potential civil rights leader.  Jesus christ, think of all the Ghandis and Martin Luther Kings you've murdered.. No one is arguing every sperm that exists *must* be combined with an egg.  Once they *do* combine, however, they form a genetically distinct human organism that, if left unmolested in the womb, can continue to develop.  . I'm saying that if you care about life, you must also care about sperm in the same way you do embryos.  Sperm literally have a sense of smell, they are technically sentient. Your decision to define 'life' as the combination of a sperm and egg is entirely arbitrary, just as much as anyone elses.. ::sigh::  There is so much wrong with that comment.

If Prime Minister Harper had similarly cut funding to pro-trans groups, would that have been okay?. Apples and oranges, man. I do see what youre getting at of course, but thats not a very accurate comparison.   Trans people dont repeatedly sit outside of neo-natal units or city halls with *graphic imagery* of dead or murdered trans kids/adults.   Or heckle parents leaving the hospital because they gendered their children with pink or blue.. What is wrong with showing people the harsh reality of abortion? If it disgusts you so much you should understand why people don't like it. . Removing a cancerous tumour is pretty vile too.   Trying to denigrate a socio-medical debate by shock factor just proves to pro-choicers that its not about the fetus, its about religious and political morality. . Those two things are not even remotely the same, you just compared a fetus to a cancerous tumor. Of course it is about morality. . Im not saying theyre the same, Im saying anything unwanted removed from the body will look horrific.  Im not getting into a pro v. anti debate here.  I believe** If you denigrate a social or medical issue because of moral belief, it invalidates your argument for whomever disagrees.  Edit: **Believe what you want, but I dont think its irrelevant to say.
t3_7rdwxs	0	*	Trudeau bans anti-abortion groups from summer jobs funding. You can't be pro abortion and pro human rights. Its a self contradicting stance. You are one or the other, not both. . Really!   How about pro-choice as in every human has a say over their own bodies?. Not disagreeing but if every human has a say over their body. Do you not consider a fetus that's let's say 10-15 weeks a human. Do you at least agree at some point during a pregnancy it becomes a life/baby and if so when? Again not trying to argue I'm just curious of others views. Once the fetus escapes the womb it is a baby a person a citizen and gets all rights and privileges.  As long as it is inside the woman it is all about her and her wishes.  Simple, no?. So you would be ok with aborting a fetus at 35 weeks just a few weeks before full term? It basically is a full grown baby at that point. Don't you think a cut off at 12-13 weeks would be much more reasonable. A 35 week  abortion is straight up murder while I could see arguments for 12-13 weeks. I'm not saying it shouldn't be up to the women but anything past 20 weeks is fucked up.. My okay is irrelevant to any abortion that is not my own.  See that is one of the many points so-called prolifers fail to grasp it's none of your business.  Unless you feel women to be second class or otherwise without autonomy.. it is my business when you are murdering a child. Which at 35 weeks as proposed above is 100% a child. . Nope.
t3_7rdwxs	0	*	Trudeau bans anti-abortion groups from summer jobs funding. Actually, not quite true. What is happening is that Anti-abortion groups cannot get job funding from the federal government for the purpose of anti-abortion activism. If the organizations can confirm the funding would be for other stuff (office, etc) then they would have access to the funding.  Nice to see those that discriminate against human rights finally be visited by karma.. So why aren't abortion activists losing that same funding stream? They are advocating against the rights of the fetus which are enshrined into law.. > rights of the fetus which are enshrined into law.  Oh?  Please educate me, please highlight that part of the law where rights of the fetus are enshrined? . On the flip side, can you please highlight that part of the law where rights of abortion are enshrined? Because if they arent there, then what rights are being infringed by groups formed to express their members beliefs ( as is anyones right in a liberal democracy ). No. Prove that a fetus has rights or pipe down. . It amazes me that people don't seem to realize a fetus does not obtain personhood until its first breath. Charter rights require personhood.   This is why it is a highly aggravating factor to kill a pregnant woman...but it is not a double homicide because only one legally recognized person died.. Not true. California has fetal homicide laws. [Scott Peterson was convicted of double homicide for the 2 lives he took.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unborn_Victims_of_Violence_Act). Damn, this is the stupidest thing I didn't expect to read this morning.  Trudeau, the person mentioned in the title, is the Prime Minister of CANADA. Surely you are aware that CALIFORNIA is *not in Canada.*   It doesn't matter what California's laws are. American laws are irrelevant. The country of Canada is governed by Canadian laws.

Seems like a reasonable thing to do, he's not bragging about it like it's some big accomplishment. . Their views are not illegal so why cant they have the same access to government programs as everyone else. The only reason they are being cut off is because they hold and opinion that the government disagrees with, not for any illegal activity.. You don't 'deserve' government money. It's supplied based on what the government deems to be in the public interest. Trump decided that Planned Parenthood wasn't in the interest of the United States, and Trudeau's decided that anti-abortion groups aren't in the public interest of Canada.  The only news here is that Canada and the US have different political leanings.. They are not ending the program though. They are still giving out the money, now only to people they agree with. Its not a good thing in the US and its not a good thing there.. people voted for pro - women's right (fuck the word pro-abortion) party. Why should the government bourn from that choice support anti-abortion groups?. So if they ever come to power you would be happy with them banning abortion or any organization that advocated for it?. Your argument is bit silly. As a matter of fact it's doubly silly.  Firstly, they have not banned anti-abortion advocation. They cut down government funding to them.  If an anti-abortion government comes to power, of course, they are going to prohibit abortion. Like, that is the definition of anti-abortion government.

It's not just religious camps. *Any* camp that want money needs to check the box.. Yeah however, if the camp is found to be teaching anti abortion and the other bigoted stuff they can legally stop funding them. . Yikes, when did being against abortion become a *bigoted* opinion?. Well it's an emotional opinion centered around repressing women's reproductive rights. Just like homophobia is an emotional position based around repressing a person's choice of partner. Or racism is an emotional position based around excluding other races from the rights and priveledges one would enjoy. . I think the whole protecting the unborn part is more central to pro-lifers..

If these states democratically elect a government that does this then who am into argue with the will of the people. The individual can then retain that tax money and give it directly to planned parenthood if they want. There is no law against that.. So you should be fine with this decision since an elected official enacted policies that the people voted him in for.. Was it in their manifesto at election? No.  Is it a matter of national urgency? No Im not worried. Someone like Trudeau will hang himself politically speaking . Pretty sure being pro choice and defending abortion rights is a party platform that they run on. Yes - but to discriminate against a lawful group was not in their platform. What happens when the right get in? Youll be ok with abortion being illegal.   Democracy is the will of the majority being mindful of the minority. Actual discrimination by the left is a bad move. Why cant they just let people have free will to protest what they like?    .

His job is to decide policy for all Canadians, not use it to impose his personal views on them.  . He is the only Canadian that is prochoice?. So impose the will of the mob, rather than tolerate opposition?. There is a vocal minority into polygamy yet we don't tolerate their view.. So.. we should deny them ei or something?  If everyone involved is a consenting adult, why shouldnt it be tolerated? . It's law within the nation. It is also really complex from a policy standpoint. Abortion is a settled law though and has been for a very long time. It is a law chosen democratically and as such, should be law. The opposition are still free to voice their opposition, but now government resources should be directed toward them.

Their is currently no democrat in the [presidential line of succession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession) . Yeah, I am aware. I was talking about if Dems take back the house this year then Trump gets impeached. I wonder if there is a scenario where republicans would push for impeachment if they thought something like that was inevitable so they could have a Ryan/Hatch administration. What are the chances of that? 1 in 1000000000000000000?

Unlikely to happen. Pence appears to pretty much in the clear over this and getting 67 votes for impeaching Trump will be difficult enough.  The GOP in Congress would probably prefer Pence as President, but their primary voters think very differently. So far, the only people there really speaking out against Trump are those who are retiring.. If Pence is in the clear, I doubt it'd be hard to get 67 votes. Republicans would love their theocrat Pence in.

t3_7t13am	0	*	Trump Ordered Mueller Fired, but Backed Off When White House Counsel Threatened to Quit. So the whole story here is Trump wanted to fire Muller but obviously didn't. Wow, ground breaking stuff here.. I'd argue 'wanting' and 'ordering' are very different things.. Either way it did not happen, so what's the story?  So we're just writing stories on things that could have happened?. If you arranged for a teenage girl to come over for sex, but instead the cops showed up, it doesnt make it not a crime pal. . Not even close to what we are talking about though. Trump can fire Muller, that would not be a crime.  So that is a very poor analogy.. No, he cannot. When a cop is investigating you for being a criminal, it doesnt matter if youre his boss. You cant just fire him. Nixon was removed for this obstruction of justice.    And the hypocrisy is astounding. If Obama or Clinton had done that, republicans wouldve screamed bloody murder. Funny how the constitution doesnt mean shit whenever a republican is in office. . But again it did not happen so dumb hypothetical story. No, it did happen. He gave an order. The fact the order was refused doesnt change that.  Kruschev gave the order to fire nukes during the Cuban missile crisis, doesnt matter that the submarine general refused to do it

The past year has been a rough decade.. There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen. ~ V.I. Lenin. Lenin really let the whole using Stalin as his right hand man and getting 25 million people killed thing slip. On his death bed he warned against giving him power. Said he is much too wicked. . If you spent your life in power with Joseph Stalin as your right hand man a deathbed confession is entirely meaningless. Lenin also said, The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.. Stalin was never Lenin's righthand man. That was Trotsky if anyone. Stalin was a pretty small fry in the party and it was only after Lenin's death that he rapidly acted to seize power. Lenin never really trusted stalin and always had doubts about his motives and dedication to the cause which were inevitably proven correct.. I would say the invasion of Georgia is a strong indicator that Lenin realized Stalin was a decent hammer in his toolkit. Either way, Solzhenitsyn articulated quite lucidly how the ideology which Lenin and Stalin operated within was one and the same.

Honestly if society is telling brothers grim esq stories about Trump to children of another  country, then Trump isn't the problem. Maybe the anti Trump stuff has gone just a little bit too far.. They don't need to embellish stories to make Trump scary to children. The man bragged about the size of his nuclear launch button on Twitter. That's something a cartoon villain would do.. Tell me again who was that to?. Do you recall a single time Obama played around with the idea of a nuclear exchange, or any global leader for that matter? Fuckin' hell. There's a reason those sorts of conversations happen exclusively in war rooms, SCIFs, and presidential convoys, and not on twitter. What is so hard for you to understand about this?. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/26/us-developing-missile-shield-to-guard-against-nuclear-attack-fro/amp/  Short memory huh? . Obama didn't talk about Nukes like they were toys. He didn't need generals explaining why they're a last resort. . Ever get the feeling that reddit has been so thoroughly compromised that it's time to go?  We're arguing against bots and paid shills half the time, and the other half it's with the chronically stupid. Fuck the admins.
t3_7qcz2f	1	*	Increases in internet use linked to a loss of religious affiliation, study finds. Study one religion, and you'll be hooked for life. Study two religions, and you're done in an hour.. Probably why there was so much hatred towards old games like AD&D. All those alternative deities and belief systems, people were one curious flip through an encyclopedia from running across competition.. damn chaotic neutral people..... Christ was totally chaotic good.   Or, maybe he's chaotic neutral.  He did say there are no good people except for God alone.  Edit: upon further thought, he followed the laws of Moses and yet was murdered. So, he was also lawful.  He's really fascinating.. Jesus may have been Chaotic Good but Paul was Lawful Neutral hence the slaves obey your masters etc.. Jesus was probably neutral good imo.  Paul is definitely a lawful cunt. Like the gospels,  quit when I hit Paul on my last reading of the bible. . On reflection, you're probably right about neutral good. There wasn't a lot of 'muh freedom' in the red text.. Yeah, but the first will be the last and telling rich people all their stuff doesn't matter is right in the Chaotic Good alley.

When answers to millions of questions are at your fingertips 24/7 it just feels backwards to have to choose faith over curiosity.. Kind of a false premise. Are you saying faithful people can't be curious about the natural world?. Faith is belief without evidence or the desire to find it. Curiosity is the opposite.. Have you ever held a faith?

t3_7qcz2f	0	*	Increases in internet use linked to a loss of religious affiliation, study finds. Its almost like increased access to information is making us realize religion is based on fairy tales. . That's not what the article concludes. . Sorry, too busy being judgmental about organized religion... no time to read articles.. Upvoted for blunt honesty, lol. . But now I took the time to read it and I wouldn't say the article's conclusion necessarily contradicts what I was saying. What did you get from the article?. That increased access to the internet makes people less dogmatic, more willing to accept other beliefs and mix and match their own. It says those studied were a mix of atheists, agnostics, religious AND spiritual people. In some cases your statement probably stands true. But it's not as black and white across the entire study. . I interpret that as exposure to more information means questioning ones own beliefs which is kind of what I meant in my original comment. Fair enough. I think of it that way too. But I think we disagree on what it results in: your original statement seems to claim it means that people quit on religion entirely whereas I think the article means that SOME people quit on their religious beliefs whereas others just adjust theirs.

Trump lived long enough to remember that in person. What the fuck is even going on anymore?   Like Jesus H America we're all along for the ride, could you make it a bit less bumpy? You've got the best chance of anybody of keeping the world from being right fucked, a world you're a part of. Put on your big boy pants!. the sanest reason to vote for trump was so he wouldn't crater relations with russia. ramping down our multiple proxy wars with them instead of up. is that not big boy pants enough for you. So the punishment for Russias meddling in multiple elections both here and in Europe is nothing? . where's the proof. proof, not claims. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf. this is all we assess with high confidence b.s. claims, not proof. sorry your hatred of trump made you suggestible to neocon bullshit. Right so, every single non-Russian intelligence agency is wrong and youre right?   Weve moved past this, were no longer talking about whether or not Russia influenced the election, were talking about whether or not the Republicans helped them.. i'm sorry my dude, you are just straight up misinformed. other non russian intelligence agencies have thrown cold water on claims of russian hacking in the french and german elections for example, but you probably don't consume a wide or credible enough variety of news sources to know about that..

I think he meant it would be terrible to immediately stop delivery of mail marked for the old address. Since it's not like the people on that road moved. I'm sure they'll have months to notify the appropriate parties of the address change.. I worked for a company that had their road's name changed to [company name] parkway (they were the only two buildings on the street). They delivered mail from the old address over a decade later, because it still showed up that way on some maps. Still had the original street sign below the new one just in case.. There's a road in a small out-of-town shopping park south of Edinburgh called Costkea Way.  It's got Ikea on one side and Costco on the other.. Not Ikestco Drive?

He didn't have to go to Russia, it's very telling that he chose there though. . To be fair, there arent any that are big enough and stable enough to resist any diplomatic pressures that the United States might give.

Lots of companies just store your address and don't update it automatically unless you tell them to, so if the old address no longer works you'd have to make a list of everyone who might ever want to send you something and make sure that they have the updated street name in their database. If the old street name still works, you don't have to do anything.. On the upside who you didnt solicit to send you things but otherwise got your address by buying a list cant send you stuff unless they are keeping up on current events.. Well, no, because the old address still works. It's not going to stop any spam mail.. But in the scenario /u/splergel generated (where it did stop working), the recurring spam avoidance would be effective.

What if you had a considerable amount of mail en route, right before the name of the street changes and you never receive it?. They'll receive it.  USPS will update their database of addresses with the new streetname and add an Alias for Nemtsov from Wisconsin.  As long as DC doesn't try to reuse the Wisconsin street name with the same building numbers within the same Zip Code, everything will be fine.. Highly doubt DC will reuse the street name again.  It runs from the Potomac to the the MD line.  I assume they are only renaming the block it sits on. Wisconsin runs past a lot of embassies, a lot of them are in Georgetown. I can't remember them all, but I know a few are part of the former USSR.  . Rethinking it, they most likely aren't renaming Wisconsin at all, but rather adding an Alias to Nemtsov.  Much like a dedication than an actual renaming.  I'm looking at this from the technical side of things.  From the layperson's view, it's being renamed.

To be honest the postcode and building names and numbers will be the same, so you could put any old street name but as long as the post code and name/number are correct it'll turn up there.  Edit: the post works differently in the US to the UK. My bad. . You cannot put any old street name on mail and have it delivered. The street is a key component of your address in the US. How would a building number and an area code get you mail. Think about it.. . On the other hand, the USPS puts incredible effort into delivering mail to the intended recipient, even if the address isn't perfectly correct. If you just put Russian Embassy, Washington DC it may take a few extra days but I'm certain your letter would make it to the right place.

Yeah lets just stop mentioning the ongoing crisis of global paedophilia rings. Itll go away faster that way.. Empty words and meaningful discussion are two different things. Posting why won't someone save the whales has the same impact on the situation as his post, Its empty words that have been typed a million times doing nothing but filling space.

No, it is a waste of space that accomplishes next to nothing, bringing up the same trope comments that everyone has read before contributes zero.. There are new people entering the public space every day (young people) who have not heard this. Limiting speak that everyone has read only suppresses it until it is forgotten. Honestly, I have to question the motives of someone who would want to silence the condemnation of such a monstrous and vast conspiracy of child rape in the first place..

The biggest reason countries recognise the genocide is because the Turks keep flipping out on anyone who mention it. They could have gone the Japan route and simply keep quiet about. It's not like the Dutch parliament makes a fuss about Japan's denial of gencide.. Or the German route and never stop acknowledging their flawed past and seek to correct things. Ignoring the crimes of the past has caused Japan no small measure of diplomatic grief with her neighbours.. Or Belgian route and build monuments of the perpetrator Leopold II. . We do that to our colonialists as well. We love Churchill and Disraeli here in the UK.. Well churchill did lend a hand during that whole WWII thing. Millions of starving Indians object to Churchills idea of help.. I mean he lead britian through wwii. What britian did to india was bad in general, overall.. although i wonder if india would be even worse off right now if it was never colonized?. India was fabulously wealthy prior to Britain's arrival. The history of Britain in India is the history of pillage, plunder. Dismantling the economy of India piecemeal and sending the wealth back home.

Most countries, from the US, Israel, UK, China, Russia, Turkey, even Belgium, etc all either deny or at least downplay their historical atrocities, puffed up by right wing nationalist jingoism.  More countries should be like agermany.. No, most countries simply acknowledge what happened, and have moved on, regarding it as a sorry affair empowered by historical ignorance, but completely irrelevant nowadays, because even the children of the children of the people that experienced it are dead, and so are the children of the children of the people that perpetrated it.. If I steal something from you, acknowledge that it happened and move on doesn't mean anything for you. Colonialism has had an abosolutely distructive impact on a lot of countries, especially in Africa, something which people alive right now still feel the effects of.. Except I didn't steal jack shit from them. And neither did my parents. And neither did their parents. The sin of the father does not pass to the son.. No one is blaming you personally. The governing body that performed the actions still exist, and normally still benefits from the past action.. I'm surprised nobody has mentioned one of the main precursors leading up to this event.  Gun control. ^(so hot right now)

Everything below zero is a freezing temperature while everything above zero is not.. For water, at sea level, on earth. Its arbitrarily set to be useful in a specific way, as are imperial units in different ways.. 0 = Don't go outside.  10 = fucking freezing.   20 = really cold.   30 = chilly.   40 = cold enough.   50 = eh, whatever.  60 = ahhh, but only at night  70 = ahhhh  80 = real hot  90 = hot as balls  100 = Don't go outside.. >80 = real hot  80F/26C is considered real hot now? It's certainly not in Liberia or most of the US. Do you live in Alaska or something?.

As an atheist, I'd like to say atheism is the most feminist but there's a plenty of misogyny among atheists that needs to be fixed.  Still WAY better than most religions.. atheism or even agnosticism arent religions so dont speak about them as such. Atheism has to be a religion.  Calling atheism a religion triggers people worse than most Catholics would ever flip out.. Its because its by definition not a religion. What are atheisms tennants? Values? Proverbs and sayings? Its principles and rules? Its traditions? There are none. its just a word to define a lack of belief in a Diety. By that definition Budhhists and Confucianists could be considered atheistic as well.  . There are two kinds of atheists.   1. Atheist.  2. Religious atheist that goes around arguing their non beliefs with anyone and everyone like some ass hat . How numerous are #2? How much arguing about religion is the right amount? Or should there be no debates about religion?  I know how are difficult questions. But I think it's absolutely important that people have debates about religion at some point in their lives even for some perspective.

Man that was not a fun 12 hours. . I am just Curious, what were you supposed to call him? Rank + Last name? . No. Enlisted personnel doesn't rate (have permission) to call an officer by rank/last name. In the Marines, it's either Aye Aye Sir/Ma'am when addressing any officer, from butter bars to General.  I wasn't paying attention/on autopilot when mopping the deck when he came by. I just glanced and without thinking said, Good morning Captain. . Man, no way in hell I would have made it in the military. Way too stubborn to follow nonsense like that. Also too stupid to listen and make my life easier. . Yeah, you would be surprised. You get used to following the rules once you have been smoked for them finding an invisible piece of lint on your uniform. I was yelled at once by a LT for eating a banana improperly.

They don't need to send 60000 but at least a couple would be nice.. In Canada I have friends every year that go up north to plant trees. They get paid quite well actually from the government (after you get fast at planting, since you get paid per tree).   I think in countries with small professional armies, its better for them to train and do other military stuff than go plant trees in a mosquito infested swamp up north lol. Especially when there is les than 60,000 in our military . How dare you. Ill have you know the Canadian army is  ...  Fuuuck, its only [40,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Army) including reserves? Lol. How does Australia have a bigger Army than you guys? We have a much smaller population. Plus since we pretty much treat the NZ army as being apart of our army for anything that actually matters, we easily outnumber you.. I can only assume its cause were not quite as beset with wildlife trying to kill us as you guys are :P Best of luck with the next emu offensive!

Parents should be able to spend time with their kids and take time of work. . so paterninty leave, for the parents to spend time with the born child,  but no maternity leave for the pregnant woman who is in no way burdened by pregnancy.  just a few hours in the ER for the actual child birth and that it?. Your arse is so big you've managed to pull like 4 strawmans out of it so far. the only comment i was addressing was the OP saying that there is no difference between fatherhood and motherhood, which is obviously false.

They're probably just going to push them off to Jordan at this point.   It not apartheid i don't know why people keep trying to make the comparison.. Its probably because apartheid means a policy or system of segregation or discrimination based on ethnicity or race.. Israelis are multiracial and multiethnic.. This article isnt talking about Isreal, its talking about the West Bank.  Now do Palestinians in the West Bank have the same rights as Isrealis? Did you read the article? Did you read the previous comment?. Did you?  Why would they. They aren't citizens and have their own government who fucks up getting them their own state for decades.. So exactly its an apartheid.

They only burn cars and throw acid on or beat regular civilians/delivery men, police, and reporters . Sources with evidence that Europe has turned into a flaming hell hole, or are you just going to bring up one incident and make a sweeping claim because of it . Can't reply to all of you morons at once. A simple search shows literal fires during migrant riots. Wow, took you a month to come up with that?. Waiting on you. There's nothing else to say beyond Wow bud, you're really dedicated to revive a month old discussion. You're supposed to concede that you're completely clueless, that migrant riots do indeed happen, and that no go zones are in fact dangerous and wide spread . I dont have the concede anything friendo

Everybody there had one question: that crazy statement you made, are you going to withdraw it? said Roel Geeraedts, a political reporter at the Dutch television station RTL Nieuws in a phone interview about the event. We were not getting answers, so we all kept asking it.. This is fucking awesome. American news people need to learn from the Dutch reports. When these miserable lying Trumpian cocksuckers try to evade a straight up question, the next reporter asks the exact same question until they get a valid answer. The Dutch press beat the living shit out of this Tea Bagging asswipe.  It is glorious. . But the Netherlands dont have trump supporters because the Netherlands have functional and funded public education. Our second largest party is so anti-Muslim that Trump would tell them to take it down a notch. What are you on about? . It's definitely not as bad that Trump would tell them to take it down a notch. Remember when Trump forbade citizens of a few countries to fly to the USA even if they had citizenship?  That wouldn't fly here.. A travel ban from high risk areas is in no way near as bad as promising to ban the Koran, close mosques and lock up Muslims without due process. . Because not letting innocent people who live and have their family in America into the country even when they're in a relatively safe area is much worse than speeches that have no chance of ever becoming true.. No, it isn't. You don't have the right to enter America and it is completely in accordance to the law for Trump to temporally halt all forms of travel between the USA and another country. A politician promising to do away with our constitution because he dislikes Muslims is far worse than that.

He could easily have said I might have been misled about that specific fact but my overall position still stands.

A Muslim may not have burned a Dutch politician, but one did kill a [Dutch film maker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_van_Gogh_(film_director%29), and the pinned a note to his body using a knife calling for the murder of a Dutch politician (Ayan Hirsi Ali). 13 years ago some Dutch guy was murdered by a Muslim. In America they flew planes into buildings around that time, I don't see how this is relevant to the statement he made.. Im not defending the US Ambassador Im just suggesting he may be conflating events . burning != stabbing  politician != filmaker. So instead of a liar you're suggesting he may just be a total idiot?   Note: he is in fact a liar since he denies ever making those statements to begin with despite the fact that they were recorded. . no. Although I think it's idiotic to lie, conflating implies that there's some amount of truth to what he says. He didnt know about the guy who got stabbed 13 years ago.. But there is no truth to what he says. He is either a liar or an idiot, there is no third option.. im saying hes a liar

Trump and his incompetent band of imbeciles continue to destroy America's reputation across the globe. Absolutely disgraceful. You can thank the liberals and Democrats for Trumps win. . Thats some amazing fucked up logic.. Eh he's not wrong the Democrats could have put up a stronger candidate a bunch of moderate people didn't vote cause they didn't like Hillary they may have tipped it in the Democratic direction. Regardless of that point it's still pretty fucked up that enough people were okay with the dumpster fire that's happening right now.. Then the proper statement would be to blame the DNC, not simply liberals and democrats. As that places blame on all the voters.  And generalizing 300 million people is always wrong.. By Democrats I meant the DNC establishment. Not democratic voters. I don't identify voters by an affiliation with a party, that's not a common practice in my country.. Sorry, I know you were talking about the DNC, I meant the person who was initially being criticized blaming liberals and democrats. I was agreeing with you on your premise and saying that if that is what he meant as well, he phrased it poorly.. Ah of course, yes. It's unclear whether he's making a pointed critique of the DNC or he's pulling a typical Trump/conservative it's the liberals fault, Trump got elected cause of PC culture, etc. BS.

So the turks that forced their way into Syria and are destroying their cities are on a moral high-ground in your opinion and thus entitled to kill civilians just because they're hungry and have no safe place to be in? Nobody likes refugees. But surely there's another way than killing them.. The whole point of border guards is to stop people crossing the border. They most likely told them to stop, and once the order was disobeyed they opened fire. Where is the problem? . Maybe detaining them? What if cops tried to stop you and you kept going, would that be reason enough for them to kill you? The problem is in the killing part, not them trying to protect the border.. Border guards aren't cops, they're soldiers. Their orders are most likely to prevent violation of the border with deadly force, doubly so when there is an active war zone across the border. Turkey has suffered several terrorist attacks by the PKK, so it's understandable that they have heightened border security measures.. I do not contest that. That may be the case, but imo it's never alright to kill civilians.. Aslong as there are PKK and isis terrorists in Syria turkey has to protect her borders by all means, if Turkey says you can't get in you stay the fuck out. No one in the western world wants the refugees why should we take more then the 3.5 million we already have. . Ok. Let me ask you this: why not turn them away or detain and expel? Why shoot them outright?

And now they're all pissed that THE MEDIA spends all it's time attacking trump and the GOP.    Because they control all three branches!  But no, that inconvienient fact can't penetrate their fantasy land where everyone else is obsessed and trump's living rent free or whatever buzzword is the meme.. Lol not that he doesn't deserve the criticism, but the media does spend all of it's time attacking Trump and the GOP and there is a very real world where Trump is living rent free in people's heads. Never seen people lose their mind over someone like people do over him. I've been in awe of his skills at making people have meltdowns for like 3 years now.. I don't understand why anyone is surprised or considers it skilled that people pay attention when the most powerful man in the world acts like a manchild or a troll.  It is not something to be regarded with respect.. This started well before he was president. . You mean during the campaign?   Huh.  Why would anyone pay attention then either?. It started in the 80's when the asshole took out a full page ad calling on the death penalty for the Central Park 5. He has been a piece of shit forever and the morons lapped it up.

Seems reasonable. Reasonable as a process yes.  But those numbers are beyond realistic today.  Thats not necessarily bad.  What happens instead of changing law, is more and more executive just ignoring it or judiciary making decisions contradicting it.

t3_7zw3vg	1	*	Australian PM declines to offer Trump any advice on gun control. The article doesn't mention whether Trump has even asked for advice, which he didn't. This is a REALLY shitty article.. Actually its a very good article.   Whats shitty is reacting to just the headline without bothering to read the article at all.   From the article:  > Turnbull, who met Trump for talks in Washington on Friday, said he was not going to offer the United States any advice on the issue, which is dividing Americans.   Sure looks pretty clear to me that Trump hasnt asked. . You are absolutely right.  I love how semantics work. Instead of reading the content, logically, as it is clearly written. People interpret it in a way that best fits their narrative.  . The headline is very clearly written to fit a specific narrative. not much transformation needed.. Headlines are rarely very clearly written at all. . ok, i'll rephrase  the headline was written with a very clear intention to fit a specific narrative.  better?. No, its not. Because I think it was just a vague headline that wasnt written with any intention at all. And because its vague, youre seeing in it what youre inclined to see. . It's because there are always headlines X refuses to meet with Trump, Trump not invited to X, X refuses white house visit.  So this looks like another He decided not to offer advice because its Trump.  If you think headlines have no intention then you are really naiive.

Drugs were already illegal in the Philippines. Duterte just started the police death squads to kill innocent people and accuse them of being drug addicts/dealers, and gave a free pass to vigilantes doing the same thing.. And his drug dealer son, don't forget him.. Has that been proven already?  He did say to kill his son if his son was indeed part of any drug dealing ring.. Not drug dealer son but smuggler. Happens that a shipment of drugs was given the OK by him.   Customs here is very corrupt and lucrative.. Yeah but was that proven?  Last I heard it wasn't.  I mean, if you're going to kill the guy for drug dealing, at least let's get our facts straight.  Otherwise we're no better than Duterte.. It's all rumors.

I dismiss it because its a rampant trend with doctors seeking fame, or pushing agendas by trying to imply that technology is the source of mental illness.   i mean FFS the WHO is trying to declare videogame addiction as a mental illness- instead of acknowledging that  irresponsible videogaming is an effect- not a cause. . Obviously, you are much more knowledgeable than the researchers writing papers about this topic. Why don't you write a journal paper discussing your findings about how there's a conspiracy to create diseases that aren't real. . i mean these are the same doctors that classified homosexuality as a mental illness if thats the alleyway you wanna walk down. the title of doctor, or scientist, does not render you an absolute.  . How do you know those were the same doctors? And no body said being a scientist means you're infallible. Just the consensus at this point is that ADHD is a real issue, and it is also overdiagnosed. The consensus is what matters, not what some random scientist says just because of their credentials.. nobody is saying ADHD doesnt exist. i am saying that trying to link it to smartphone usage is fucking retarded, and bad science. . Why do you think that? Did you read their paper and find some methodological error? Did you read a paper that said  the opposite? Or are you just biased from the beginning and are just going to assume smartphone usage has absolutely nothing to do with ADHD before you even bother to do the research? I just want to know how you're so confident in your conclusion.

Offer support to people wanting to recover. Stop empowering the black market.. Legalize, not decriminalize. No half measures.. Regulate not legalise.  Booze is not legal, its regulated.  If it were legal there were be no restrictions on age of buyer, advertising rules etc.  We need good drug regulations that allow adults to buy good quality drugs from non profit organisations with no advertising allowed and all money put towards harm reduction and rehabs. . Sounds like just full legalization is better. Especially if only non profits are allowed to sell it.   If people cant profit off it legally, theyll do so illegally then, and the new rules wont really have much effect. People make money off alcohol. No different. . So you think full legalised drugs where profit run companies can advertise drugs to children on daytime TV ?  No regulations means anything goes.  . I don't believe in no regulation on the industry, but just a lot less than it seems you do. Basically, it should be like alcohol is in Europe: legal at 18 for anyone to try. And yes, let people advertise on TV.  Drugs and alcohol are already taboo here, and being taboo only makes it worse. Legalize, with little regulation.

I'm not dismissing anything. You're changing the subject. I dislike Islam too, but it's still wrong to suggest women protesting head scarfs right now are in being dealt with brutally. They are just being fined and released.  If you just need to get Islam sucks off your chest, go ahead. I don't care.

That says all about these monsters and their followers: they hide behind the excuse of religion to commit the worst crimes for their own benefits. Update: to avoid doubt, these monsters mean the cowards who hide behind ANY religion. Nothing to do with one religion.. Are you taking the piss? As if youre giving Muslims shit for this. Anti- Vaxxers arent religion specific you fuckin gobshite. I hope to see your criticism of Robert De Niro next time he doubts vaccinations or is he not brown and Muslim enough for you care?. He never mentioned the word Muslim. There are religious movements within almost every religion who do this, and all of them are despicable, although I feel like our fear of being called anti-(insert religion here) means we are uncomfortable making the link between religions on this one . What the fuck was he talking about then? In a post about Muslim anti vaxxers? He was being a racist prick.. I dont know the guy so cant comment on him but I dont think jumping to calling it racism helps the debate about how to stop anti Vaxxers of all religions and none from fucking up their children. Love how your so tolerant of his bigoted bollocks but as soon as someone throws out the racist shout its too far.. Fairs, Im still genuinely hoping that he didnt mean only Muslims as they arent the only religion doing this, but hes gone rather quiet now :/. That was my issue. I understand each religion has its own extreme groups, like Ive said before Anti Vaxxers arent religion specific they dont even have to be religious actually. Im hoping I was wrong and he wasnt referring to Muslims specifically and I just jumped the gun.

Being obese your whole life is pretty shitty too.. being hungry your whole life is worse... i think.. That's because you are too fat and have to keep eating to support your fat body. cut some weight and you won't feel that hungry anymore. Not quite true. When you lose weight, your body continues to act like your set weight is higher than your new healthier weight. 90% of diets fail because of the human drive of hunger. . Pretty sure 90% of diet fail because people's poor choice of food and lack of displine.  . Ok, so they didn't successfully ignore million years of evolution to eat more.

To give you a concept of how expensive they are to make and run a single desalinization plant will need it own power plant to be constructed and fueled as well.. Not only expensive, but also environmentally destructive. The hyper-saline wastewater that gets released back into the ocean creates large dead zones. . Only if you do a bad job. It's very easy to dilute it to where it has no impact at all.. They dont have sewage treatment. They dump shit and garbage into the oceans. They will dump the excess salt in too. Please start caring about the oceans. They are our life saviours, not a toilet. Tell that to the billions of animals that shit and piss in it every day. The solution to pollution is dilution.  If the dumped their waste water far out at sea it would take longer to have an impact. The impact would still be noticeable and terrible, but it would take longer..

He wasn't the president yet during the election, he could only invoke it for things that happened after he was sworn in.. Bet you a dollar he tries it anyway. Hasn't he already looked into whether he can give himself a Presidential Pardon?. He's talked about (on Twitter, of course) the President's absolute power to pardon anyone, but I think that's as close as he's come.    However, I believe that's something of an open question, whether a President can pardon himself. It's never been tested in court.    . It flies in the face of reason and whether or not it's legal it shouldn't be allowed.. It also flies in the face of reason that Presidents are allowed egregious conflicts of interest and that it's only been tradition that they've done the right thing, but here we are.

t3_7vpnbo	0	*	France outlaws texting while driving, even when youre at a red light. >even when you're at a red light  How would that make a difference? You're still driving the car. . I think the difference is that texting and driving laws are legislated because its dangerous.  When the car is not moving, texting ceases to be dangerous making this law seemingly one of convenience or revenue generation.  Ok if constituents want that, but it does seem counterintuitive if the goal is simply safety.. You're still in control of the vehicle even when you're at a light. It's not like you're parked in a lot.. Being in control of a car does not automatically make texting dangerous.  If you can find any studies that claim texting while the foot is on the brake at a standstill is dangerous, please share them.. I'm sure there's no study anywhere that says you're safer with your eyes on the road when you're in traffic.. The law is about being at a red light.  You can try to pretend like you actually think texting at a red light is dangerous if you want.  Im not going to pretend with you.. If you are in traffic, you need to pay attention to the road. I was almost run over by someone who was texting at a red, didn't realize her foot wasn't really on the brake, and who had rolled forward until I was trapped between her and the car in front of me. Waiting at the light is part of driving; act like it.. Question: you were walking between two vehicles? Are crosswalks not a thing where you live?

And again, I don't support infant circumcision, but a state must necessarily balance religious freedom and their laws pertaining to well-being.. Well, if tey can live without some of their laws I'm sure they can catch up with the civilized world and live with the ban on circumscision. At the very least, if female genital mutilation is illegal in most ciuntries (including Iceland) why should doing the same to boys be any different. . The most common FGM and MGM aren't really that similar. Many women who undergo FGM cannot properly achieve orgasm, a *very* small percentage of males who undergo MGM face complications that make it difficult to achieve orgasm.  I do not approve of male infant circumcision, but it should not be equated to the most common forms of FGM.. Because its men or because...?  Cause I think its the social acceptance of male circumcision that makes people say shit like this.. Because FGM in its most common form is *designed* to make it difficult to achieve orgasm, but MGM is not.

Executing children for disobeying their parents is a major part of Jewish religion. Should Iceland allow those?. > Executing children for disobeying their parents is a major part of Jewish religion.  Say what? Not a single child has ever been executed by the Jewish religion for disobeying parents. Ever.  You are quite ignorant if you think that.. I don't know if this happened or not in the last 3000+ years of Jewish history. But the Jewish religious writings are clear on this. . > are clear on this.  No, they are not clear at all.  You are misreading the writings. It's not a law that has ever been carried out. It was never intended to be carried out.  The law has so many impossible to meet restrictions, that it was obvious from the start it was not intended that anyone actually be executed. It was just intended as a warning on behavior.. > It was never intended to be carried out.   Well, if they were just kidding in this part I'm sure they can get over other parts.. Who said anything about kidding?  The other parts were not written with those restrictions, and this was. It's how it was recorded from day one.

It would be a UN without individual member veto power for starters.. That existed, it was called the League of Nations and failed very quickly since major powers had no reason to listen to it. . That sounds more like *every* nation had veto powers ;). Just what happens when you try and put an authority above a nation state. Without a way to enforce your will its pointless, and no state has the power to enforce their will on a major nuclear power. . The United States worked out pretty well for a time.

You can't be a real person, this was literally one of the largest talking points in the campaign.  Holy shit.. Yes, it was a Republican taking point. Watch the actual debate, he said Russia was not the greatest threat to our goepolitical position, which it isn't. That doesn't mean they aren't a threat, but greatest threat is a bit much.. The literal direct quote from the debate:  > Not Al Qaeda, you said Russia, Obama continued. The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know, the Cold War has been over for 20 years.

If they all get poached, we no longer have the benefit of these water-zoos to keep them from going extinct.. Serious question: what is the value of a species if they only exist in captivity to prevent them from extinction? They don't benefit the environment/biodiversity, they don't have good lives generally, and their chances of reintegration are very slim.. You might as well argue what's the point of species in the wild, too.  We're the reason these species are in this mess, you don't think there's a duty to at least try to keep the species alive?. Would you like to live in prison and get taken care of, or try to figure it out for yourself in in the wild?. Dude, I'm basically there already.  But you're missing the point.  At the moment there is no figure it out, there is extinction.  There's no more life available, for example, for rhinos.  There's a couple left in the wild waiting to die.  That's it.  No captive rhinos means no rhinos, period.  I'm not saying its great, but it's better than extinction.. What about cows. pigs, chickens, etc.. Not wild animals, not capable of surviving in the wild. Feral pigs are actually a huge issue.

It doesn't sound like you thought about Bernie's political decisions when you voted for them  It doesn't sound like critically thinking about them now  And if you're gonna say I didn't vote for Bernie then stop speaking on their behalf. . You act like we have an endless choices for people to support in our representative democracy. Of course we aren't going to agree with everything our preferred candidate stands for. And of course policy should be multidimensional.   Your ragging on Bernie supporters is baseless and infantile.. >  Of course we aren't going to agree with everything   Really? Is this like a new Reddit rule that isn't widely enforced? I sure am not getting the same benefit of the doubt. 
t3_806wv0	0	*	Leicester fire: Emergency services rush to scene of 'massive explosion' as police declare major incident. Could it be a gas explosion?. Looks strikingly similar to other gas explosions. Unfortunately it was a ~~Polish shop~~ convenience store, so people and customers would likely be inside, unless they saw it coming (if it was a gas explosion). Do they add sulfer to the gas so you could smell it in the UK?  I'd think people would expect to have some advance notice through the smell.. [Yes](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/what-exactly-is-mercaptan-8462250.html), often mercaptan is added, but i'm not sure if its always the case.  . Not sure about UK regulations, but in the US it is required for any non-industrial user of natural gas.. Minor trivia: my grandfather invented the odor used for this purpose (he was a chemical engineer at Bechtel).. Your grandfather can honestly claim to have saved hundreds of lives- that's a fantastic legacy :-). probably tens of thousands.

Besides, I'm broke and don't give a fuck about the ads I saw (have blocked for years because of how obnoxious they were).. I also think it would be nice if they didn't do it.

Socialists are vehemently against rich people and wealth accumalation, so unless he is a self-hating rich guy he can't be a socialist.. Having wealth doesn't exclude you from an ideology. That is  a fundamentally anti-socialist idea.. actually, the idea that wealthier people are less likely to support radically egalitarian ideologies is a pretty [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism) analysis.

t3_7pgptf	0	*	Scarborough Tim Hortons workers banned from accepting tips after wage hike | Told to put tips into the till. I still don't understand why tipping is a thing in American culture? I just pay for my meal and leave. Is it mandatory? Like if you don't tip the waiter, you can't leave with the meal?  Honest question someone explain to me. . Its a relic from prohibition.   People would tip the waiter to get a bit of alcohol.   After alcohol was legalized, people kept tipping out of habit and stuff, but the restaurant industry used it to be able to pay their workers less (legally mind you)       Its a stupid system and works against the employee. I know plenty of servers who love the tipping system. They'd change jobs if tips went away and they were paid minimum wage. . There's a such thing as a vocal minority.  Your friends are a part of the 1% of the restaurant employee system lol.   There is variance in everything. They are certainly part of a group larger than 1%. that was a joke, but they are not the majority of servers.. You don't think a majority of servers make more than minimum wage? Even my neighbor who worked at a Denny's made more than minimum wage. I do think employers should pay at least minimum wage. I have no problem adding a tip on top of that. . Its not all fine and dandy everywhere.  Lots of places abuse this law  https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm  You can legally pay them under minimum wage directly if their tips make up the difference.

Unite and form unions like in our country,.https://www.expatica.com/nl/employment/Dutch-contracts-and-employment-law_102521.html. When I worked at Tim Hortons, my boss told me that if even heard the word Union *whispered*, he would fire me on the spot and anyone who could have heard me.   It's things lije this that are the strongest arguments for unions. . that's when you record him saying that, and report him.   that's *SSSUUUPPPER* illegal.. It was pre-smart phone days. Oh gosh, I'm suddenly old!   But yes, super illegal and happens in nearly every Tim Hortons. . so, you just make sure he doesn't hear the whispers until the paperwork is on his desk.   but even pre-smart phones, recording surreptitiously was pretty easy. Then the boss will just shut down the location and make a new one two store fronts down.  It's definitely cheaper to fire everyone and relocate than it is to deal with a union.

If the rest of Britain was willing to provide free education for Scottish students like the EU does then I'm sure Holyrood would be willing to extend the same to them. . The rest of Britain pays taxes for Scottish students to get free tuition, so it should be free for the rest of the students in Britain.. That's not how it works. Scotland would be getting exactly the same amount regardless of if they provided tuition fees or not. You don't get to pick which parts of the budget you agree with and which parts you don't.  Here's a radical thought. If you want free tuition, try voting in politicians that will provide it.. We should abolish devolution and integrate Scottish law into English as was done with wales before that was devolved, or give Scotland Home Rule except with a charge for defence and foreign affairs. This halfway status shouldnt be allowed to continue. . We should make the UK into a federal system.. Itll never happen because it requires England, the largest voting bloc in the UK, to pass constitutional change which they wont agree to.. Yep, which is one of the reasons I support Independence.

It's just having a large amount of military branches and state agencies roleplay various scenarios. The full scale part just means that it happens all over the nation instead of just locally in some foresty region somewhere.. I thought full scale wouldve been total war.. Which is why it was all over the nation? It would have been better for them to have done drills in NATO nations as well but there may have been a few hurdles to that.   Plus I feel like any upcoming major war with Russia would entail them annexing a Eastern European nation or two and then turtling down until the other side gives up. (Any such move would require the tacit support of China though). That, or China's disinterest and neutrality.. China aint siding with Russia in that shit, you bring a war close to them they will not sit their and shut up. The only thing china cares about now days is keeping turmoil as far away from them as possible.. And let's not forget that the EU and US are the main trading partners for China, they would lose a lot of export. I don't think that would be in their best interest.. That's assuming NATO would win. Not saying they wouldn't, but WWIII with a new axis of evil consisting of Russia, China, and North Korea wouldn't be easy.

This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence.. By your definition - Syria. And Crimea.

t3_810z4t	0	*	White South African farmers to be removed from their land after parliament vote. Does South Africa want a civil war? Because this is how you start one.. The whites don't have the numbers or the international support to make a war of it. They'll be run out of the country and/or killed.. Yes, this. The whites can't realistically fight back. There will be no war, just victims.. South Africa commiting genocide would provide western countries with incentive to start a war with them.. The West does not have a great track record of intervening in genocide in Africa. Sad that it may take white victims to change that.. No it won't. The UN won't consider them victims. I study International Relations and everything I have read from the UN makes it clear that they don't consider white minorities to be victims. The UN has even praised scholars who actively claim that white people will always be the oppressors. . Well good thing 'the UN' doesn't control security decisions like this, and no african countries are on the only council that matters, the Security Council. USA, France, and of course especially Britain would all be keen to stop this. Russia probably wouldn't have any reason to object, neither would China, and thus it will be. If NATO wants an intervention it will get it, UN be damned.. But why would they? South African race relations isn't a top priority for any of those states besides maybe Britain. Everyone else has no real reason to care unless it becomes a vote winning issue for politicians.

Dude, my family have owned farms in the Karoo for 100s of years. They have cultivated it and farmed it and made something for themselves.

This is quite frustrating as it basically kills a lot of foreign investment or any immigration for that matter  The Democratic Alliance seems to be the only not extreme option, they really need to get in. I would say tourism as well. White guy here. Debated visiting the tourist areas of South Africa as they seemed beautiful.  Following the treatment of whites in the country and how things are gradually getting worse, I wont be visiting.   Even though it doesnt target tourists, who knows what crazy mob mentality could happen. Also not willing to support a government that does that.  Itd be like touring North Korea or Iran.... You'd ironically probably be SAFER in NK or Iran... they aren't borderline genocidal towards white people. iran maybe, a foreigner would not be safer in NK. Plenty of Americans have been safe on NK tours if they don't do anything stupid and follow the rules. Yeah if you follow the rules in South Africa you probably won't be killed either, pretty much applies to anywhere really.  However how ridiculous the rules you have to follow to not die are a lot worse in NK.. NK isn't stupid.  They don't really mess with foreigners.  They mostly just oppress their own people.

So I doubt a civil war will last long of it ever happens. Well, don't we need to factor in international support? Also, I can't believe that entire African population would turn on these people, these are people who have lived their entire lives there.

This is quite frustrating as it basically kills a lot of foreign investment or any immigration for that matter  The Democratic Alliance seems to be the only not extreme option, they really need to get in. I would say tourism as well. White guy here. Debated visiting the tourist areas of South Africa as they seemed beautiful.  Following the treatment of whites in the country and how things are gradually getting worse, I wont be visiting.   Even though it doesnt target tourists, who knows what crazy mob mentality could happen. Also not willing to support a government that does that.  Itd be like touring North Korea or Iran.... You'd ironically probably be SAFER in NK or Iran... they aren't borderline genocidal towards white people. Your right; North Korea isn't borderline genocidal. They are very genocidal.. They aren't calling for white people or what have you to be killed, unlike some South Africans. They only imprison people for political reasons. Dude North Korea will put you and three generations of your family in concentration camps for disloyalty to the regime.  South Africa sounds like the situation is deteriorating there, but it is nothing compared to North Korea.. Somehow I bet your sources on that are a little weaker than literal video.  So I'd say its safe to say, south africa is without a doubt worse than north korea.

If you claim to fight racism, but you're perfectly fine with racism against whites, you're not fighting racism. You're just fueling a hateful fire.. Yep I agree. At the same time, if you're outraged by this, but are perfectly fine with Trump calling Mexicans racists, refusing to differentiate the KKK with anti hate protestors, you're a god damn hypocrite.. Antifa are literally classified as terrorists and are as bad as if not worse than the current state of the KKk. . Oh yeah lets see 40 plus ppl killed by racist far white supremacists in the past few years in North America alone.  Antifa is trash, but comparing them with white supremacists? You're dead wrong.. You're moving the goal posts now. It went from one specific unidentifiable to many of several years.   Anita's ideology is currently a much more significant threat than the white supremacists could hope to be. . Yeah sure a hate group that has killed 40 plus people are much less significant than antifa who has killed zero.  Hey buddy, just because your white and will never be targeted by white supremacists doesn't mean they aren't a threat.. Hey buddy just because I'm white doesn't mean racist people don't/can't target me since ya know, racist people have a hard time liking anyone.  If you wanna talk about significant numbers affecting the black community talk about black on black crime. If I were a white supremacist I'd kick my feet up because they're doing a far better job themselves. . Yes exactly thats cool, these farmers don't deserve this at all.  I just would like it if people respected everyone suffering regardless of race. Antifa has pretty much died down, as they should.

This is quite frustrating as it basically kills a lot of foreign investment or any immigration for that matter  The Democratic Alliance seems to be the only not extreme option, they really need to get in. I would say tourism as well. There's a saying in South Africa...  What's the difference between a tourist and a racist? Two weeks.. I don't get it. . It means people go there to see the beauty of the country and your around but after spending two weeks surrounded by the culture, which is hostile to whites, they will become racist against the black people who were racist towards them.. I get that it's a joke but is it really being racist to dislike the people the were racist to you?  . It is when you then bring that viewpoint back to the US or other countries where the blacks there arent connected in anyway. . That is a far stretch.  I don't think I personally know anyone that would equate the two.

Given that the goverment of the nation itself can not see how far reaching the ramifications of this move could be, I personally cannot comprehend how horribly this will go. This is going to be a shit show. . Ill bet that this is going to lead to starvation; theres no way you can pull the farmers from the land/land from the farmers and still get crops.. Well cape town is going to run out of water so this kind of fuckup is definitely going to happen.. Maybe without the farmers using all the water they can extend the water supply another 3 months.  Look on the bright side!. They already have. The farmers opened their reservoirs for the city, which is why 0 day is in June now and not May or April.. so no water, nor food.  Oh happy times for all of htose people!. No employment either for tens of thousands of farm workers. Personally, I value water and food over employment.
t3_810z4t	0	*	White South African farmers to be removed from their land after parliament vote. Its not reverse racism.  Its just racism.  Like in the apartheid days but reverse.. Any hatred of another race for simply being another race is racism no matter who is guilty of it. Its wrong, plain and simple.. Hurr durr but power multiplied by feelings equals racism  I fucking hate the people who try to justify racism against white people. Shit like that is literally why Trump was elected, he's the ultimate middle finger to that shit. Identity politics are the downfall of the west. . Honestly the backlash against PC culuture is likely why Trump won.  Seeing idiots block traffic, college campuses turning into riots and just the most ridiculous types of mentally ill logic being shoved down peoples throats is why he won.    . I mean, there was also the fact that Hillary was simply a shitty candidate that no one wanted.. She was an amazing candidate. A policy wonk who knew the issues, knew the people, and had the knowledge and experience to bring about positive change. If you want terrible candidates, look at trump and sanders - populists with absolutely zero knowledge or experience and garbage policy proposals. . > She was an amazing candidate.   Then whyd she lose?. Becauss the electoral college gives more voting power to rural states which, at this point in time, lean right

But for real, it would be deadly and ugly if a racially charged civil war were to break out.

East Germanys per capita GDP was half of West Germanys, and for its severe flaws and repression had a relatively literate and skilled population.  North Koreas per capita GDP is 1/40th of South Koreas.  The condition of its people after reunification would be more comparable to freed slaves than to East Germany.

Young South Koreans have no real interest in reunification because they don't have any family there anymore. Older Koreans actually remember having family on the other side, but for younger Koreans they have no connection to the north.. It seems like if they want to see family, there are a lot of options in between the current zero contact situation and full reunification available to them.. yeah, but the border went up like fifty years ago.

I know I got violent and abusive and we broke up a long time ago, and sure I've threatened to murder you and your family ever since, but the divorce was never *technically final* and, well, I haven't eaten in 60 years... so whadya think?. Let's be honest though, South Korea was also thinking about invading the North back in the 50s.  So it is really like an abusive relationship where one cleaned up and other didn't.. Lol we didn't give them heavy weapons because we feared exactly that. They were also a military dictatorship so brutal that refugees were fleeing *into* North Korea. . And boy do they regret it..

t3_7r8kxs	1	*	Gunmen kill mother, daughter polio workers in Pakistan. Pakistan regularly launches anti-polio drives despite threats from the Taliban, who perceive the campaign as part of a Western conspiracy and claim it will sterilize Pakistani children.. We did use inoculation as a cover for obtaining DNA in the hunt for UBL; their concerns are misguided but grounded in some truth. Thanks CIA. No, seriously. Thank you.. You'd have to be some kind of lead paint drinking gasoline sniffer to want to unironically thank the CIA for virtually anything. . I don't get it. Mostly everyone was praising Obama for taking out Bin Laden but the CIA can't get kudos for it?. Two different things. They are talking about the unethical methods they used which did not help at all vs actually capturing him which ground intelligence lead. Admittedly Obama has to take some of the blame but the CIA's dodgy practices are causing blow back. I mean, ignoring the torture aspect, there was plenty of information gained by the CIA through traditional spycraft that I think they deserve recognition. . But this is not traditional spy craft this is abusing a humanitarian effort to collect DNA. Its a massive invasion of personal privacy and a breach of their human rights. Doing this has hurt the US, the CIA and other humanitarian acts. Imagine if they were collecting people's DNA without permission on home soil.
t3_7sf0y6	0	*	Canada, TPP members agree to revised deal without the United States. I seem to remember everyone on Reddit being rabidly against tpp in 2016. Now, this is what happenswhen  we're not involved. This big trade deal just goes ahead without us. So  have fun with that.. To be fair, without US involvement, it's a much better deal.  The intellectual property portion is now gone.  . Is that the provision that protected IP? As in, you can't use shit I thought of without paying for it? I mean, I'd like to know what that IP provision is to know if I agree with it or not.. I haven't seen the text, but I've seen multiple reports, including from credible sources like the CBC, that the intellectual property chapter of the original agreement was entirely scrapped.  . But what was that provision? Weren't we trying to protect American  IP/? and why was it a bad provision?   The chinese are all up in our shit . I'm not an American, and I have no interest in having American companies attempt to restrict my access to generic drugs, nor am I interested in increasing the length of copyright to allow American corporations to monopolize material that was created decades ago.  . Drugs and materials created by whom? Who were the ones that risked investment to make those things happen?. Utterly irrelevant.  They were given a monopoly for a limited period of time as a reward for their ingenuity or willingness to invest.  However, they may not keep it in perpetuity.  
t3_7riu3s	1	*	Apple and Samsung are both under investigation by the Italian government over planned obsolescence - Italys antitrust organization wants to know if the two companies are intentionally slowing down their phones. I've always felt my Samsung phones slow down every year.. generally every phone ive had has done that too. same with my desktop computers.  usually i wipe everything and start over, and all is well.  computers just get bogged down with random files and caching and defrag'd drives, etc.  (but also batteries at the end of their life). Random files... there is no plausible way that a desktop machine slows down over time naturally.  You can of course trash it with all kinds of garbage until it is full, but aside that, no way.. that's what i meant by random files.  bloated cache folders have crippled my computer before if i don't pay attention. Just reduce the cache size then from the applications you are using?  You know that the cache files make the SWs faster?  And that actually is not crippling anything. It just is a full disk, that is it. Your system's performance is entirely the same.. if you have only one disk, and it's full, you aren't going to be able to get anything done.   also, yes i can reduce the cache size of all of the cache hog apps, but ive just learned to keep an eye on my overall free disk space.. I really think this is so forced of you to try to make Windows look bad and all it does actually is making you look very uninformed and incapable as a user.. i totally didn't mention windows.  and it's pretty universally known that if you don't have disk space available, your computer will grind to a halt, windows or mac.  have another cup of coffee. you totally need it.

t3_7x0zkl	0	*	19 American travelers to Cuba report symptoms similar to those suffered by diplomats. I think it will all turn out to be shock from being confronted with a completely different way of organising society.. I've been living in Cuba. Why didn't I get sudden nose bleeds?. Maybe you didn't get a shock from seeing a different kind of society?  I've been to Cuba, and suffered no ill effects either. But I'm no American, so there's that to take into consideration.. > But I'm no American, so there's that to take into consideration.  Good point. Why would someone attack a citizen from some irrelevant country? . Dude, there is no attacking by Cuba. It is a mental problem Americans have. Psychologic shock from being in a country where the streets are safe and education is free.  And no billboards on the streets. Suddenly, they don't know what to drink anymore.. If its so safe then why have thousands of people floated miles across shark infested waters just to escape? . I don't think criminal activity is the reason they fled. They were perfectly safe walking down the street at 3AM over there (contrary to Miami, where they now mostly live).. Why did they flee? 
t3_7or3ui	0	*	Documents reveal Canada called U.S. diplomats in Havana targets of acoustic attacks months before U.S. acknowledged them. They know it is. Everything points to that. Just because there's no solid evidence. Doesn't mean it didn't happen.. An attack, yes, but not necessarily an acoustic one.. If a blatant acoustic attack isnt acoustic what the fuck is it? Aliens? Fuck no. why is it a blatant acoustic attack? It's possibly an attack but the facts of how the attack were carried out are still unknown. Could be radiation, could be gas, or electricity there's too little to go on.. There would be more people effected if any of those were used and radiation is super easy to detect even in small concentrations.. Speculation centers around a sonic weapon,[7] however, the scientific consensus is that the use of a sonic weapon is implausible.[8][9] Dr. Timothy Leighton has said If you're talking about a ray-gun rifle knocking out someone with ultrasound they can't hear at a hundred metersthat's not going to happen. Nobody is saying its a ray gun.. They're saying it's an accoustic attack, which lets clarify means SOUND. Sound is created when vibrations travel through the air. Try to explain, even just to yourself in your own head, not even using the multitude of scientific sources to prove to everyone else, how that can cause someone to lose memory. It's something else. 
t3_7plbqn	1	*	Macron urges Chinese people to make our planet great again  in Mandarin. He mispronounced a tone and now they are at war.. To be frank, he *did* horribly mispronounce the whole thing.. Who doesn't? Tonal languages are **hard** to pronounce.. The tones were but a small part of his failure... most of the Chinese words in that sentence (rang di qiu zai ci wei da) could have been easily pronounced by a non-native speaker if all they did was memorize it. The President of a nation probably doesn't have time to rote memorise that sentence to perfection.. then he probably shouldn't have bothered saying it in butchered Mandarin, if he doesn't even have the time for phonetic memorization.. Chinese people love it when foreigners try to speak their language, ime.. Yeap. When mark berkerzurk gave his speech it was well received, even if completely inaudible.
t3_7rgp79	1	*	Students attack children in school with axe leaving 5 injured, set classroom on fire with Molotov cocktail. You know what, school shootings don't sound bad compared to school axe rampage. Somehow I feel like the axe would hurt more.. Easier to outrun an axe than a bullet though.. You say that, but try running full speed in the chaos of a school axe rampage. This also applies to the guy with the axe.. Target rich environment kind of kills that argument. Not really, because it takes a lot longer to kill someone with an axe than to kill someone with a gun, so as I said, I'd rather outrun an axe than a bullet. If you offered this choice to any sane individual they'd say the same.. who said he has to kill them with the axe? One solid hit and their fucked for life somehow. Okay, it takes a lot longer to hit someone with an axe than with a bullet. I really don't know why you're arguing this, escaping an axemen is definitely easier than escaping a gunman. At this point you're being deliberately obtuse, see you later.

Way to inject your political views into a thread that had nothing to do with it at all. . It seems relevant to me. Why would you discourage people from voicing their political opinions anyway?. Because it had nothing to do with politics and usually when political views come into play and it has something to do with Muslims or left vs politics, the thread usually devolves into non sense and people arguing. . Politics has to do with pretty much everything. You can't see how regulatory funding relates politics to accidents?  Oh no. People arguing. Thanks for protecting us all. Nobody should ever subject their attitudes to scrutiny. That's not how to perfect society.. Yeah, but sometimes its just nice to not have you let us know how big of a liberal you are or having Mr. T_D let us know we are watching nothing but fake news. Sometimes its just a gas line explosion in a mall. Nothing more.

I used to do trade work, now I do trade education work. I've done carpentry, electrical, cable tech, heavy equipment maintenance, and now I work in the wind turbine and telecom industry instructing safety and technical skills.   I kind of miss carpentry working 4-10s but carpentry beats the hell out of your body. . You got it. I'm an elevator mechanic and my long weekend is just enough time for my back to feel well enough to get back to work. . Have you considered buying one of those back-bracing belts? They're used a lot in carpentry and yeah you look a little goofy unless you wear it under a shirt, but it will absolutely save your back.   It's not really worth it if by the time you're middle-aged you cannot enjoy a decent quality of life from a bad back. . Not a bad idea. I'll have to look into it. . There are nicer ones for motorcyclists who do long trips to keep your back in good posture too.

The issue is that the German military does not serve as a military, but rather an international showroom floor for the German defense industry. > an international showroom floor for the German defense industry  Doing a piss poor job of public relations then. Look at all our crap...not working.. To you and I, sure, but you and I aren't in the market for a Leo2 tank or a Type 212 submarine. To Singapore/Australia/etc, they understand the German military doesn't believe in maintenance and don't look at Germany's incompetence in that regard as a black mark against their defense products. . Still, showcasing your stuff yourself like the US and Russia does would be more productive than letting the Turks show your MBTs getting rekt in Afrin. There are plenty of live fire ranges in the middle east, just pick one.. Ah, you don't see how we Germans think as a whole. People here despise the military complex. They dislike the idea of Germany being involved in a theatre of war. They dislike the idea of German weapons being used in such. . But they seem to like the MONEY from selling weapons abroad.. The shareholder's do.  I suspect like Swedish or British citizens the people themselves aren't hugely enamoured with the idea.

Interestingly enough, US territories are counted as separate entities when accounting for international tourists instead of being lumped in with the 50 States of the US. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings  If you added the tourist numbers from Guam, Puerto Rico, & Northern Marianas onto the US then the US would be #1, just barely beating France by a few hundred thousand people.. Well, because the United States of America is 50 countries under one flag. That's why they have governors, state senates, and state laws. Federal laws, much like they do in other unions, override state laws, but are often challenged in federal courts as unconstitutional due to the perceived independence of states.. The United States are not 50 countries. They are 50... states. > The United States are not 50 countries. They are 50... states  My point is they are essentially 50 countries operating as states due to the Constitution. Yet they each have laws individual to their region... which technically makes them the United Nations of a Federal Constitutional Republic in North America.. That same level of subdivisions within a country is standard accross the globe my friend.. What does that have to do with what I'm saying?. Damn you are suffering from American Exceptionalism much more than i thought.  Is Canada 13 countries within one because it has 10 provinces and 3 territories, all with their provincial level governments?. > Damn you are suffering from American Exceptionalism much more than i thought.

It's also worth mentioning it's the go-to holiday destination for most Brits.  It's hotter than France, has more English speakers, and has cheap booze, too. It's a no-brainer for a lot of Brits.. > cheap booze  I just spent two weeks in Spain to get a break from the Norwegian winter darkness.

He answered sxed.. >We asked a taxi driver in Spain if he spoke English. He answered sxed.  Surprised you didn't get a yes yes me talk englando or similar. Spanglish has become an everyday thing here and a lot of people manage to understand/make themselves clear with their spanglish and gestures.  Thankfully we're getting better at English, albeit slow.. Ahah I'm Portuguese and I went to Barcelona last year, as expected they couldn't understand Portuguese in the slightest, so we had to use english most of the time, we could understand nearly any Spanish they used, but talking Spanish was a no no for me, I didn't want to embarrass myself that much. So yeah weird vacation, using a Germanic language when both of us spoke romance languages. . So weird, a lot of argentinians (including me) can speak spanish and understand portuguese (more or less) when going to brazil. Idk maybe its our accent that makes it hard for them, a lot of ppl when earing european portuguese for the 1st time think its Russian ahahh. I'm Galician and I'm supposed to be able to understand Portuguese, but I find it very hard to understand people from Portugal. Brazilians, on the other hand, are much easier for me to understand.

Perhaps they are homeless due to addiction, or mental health issues, some refuse help after all, family fall out or young children running away/abused. Even having a large pool of money doesnt solve the issues unless you get to the route cause of some of them.. Without money you have no resources to help with the issues youve highlighted. Everyone arguing money isnt the answer have never been poor. A large pool of money buys mental health facilities, shelters for abused, etc.. Excuse me, Ive been homeless, Ive had everything taken away from me as a child of 12, please dont presume that Ive come from a wealthy background.

We'd always have yours as well, as we did in WW2. . ... not to mention WWI!. Didn't really have a choice in WWI.. That doesn't make the Vimy battle less honourable for the Canadians.. Interesting story about Vimy Ridge. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.thestar.com/amp/news/2007/04/07/how_hitler_spared_vimy_ridge.html. I never knew about that at all. I've been there and have relatives there, and I've never come across even a mention of that. Thank you for posting that! . history is written by the victors 
t3_7uwkrq	1	*	Surrounded by Russian vessels, Canadian warship unlocked missiles so they could be fired sailor says. So what? They did not fire them so nothing happened. Unlocking them is just prudent. . It's still a pretty big deal. Unholstering a pistol is always a big deal, for example, whether or not it's fired (it's just that much bigger of a deal when it is fired).. Except if you actually read what happened, this thread is clickbait.  This is literal anti-Russia nonsense.  This is approaching the level of fake news that the right wingers love to complain about.. How so?. It's not straight up fake news because there were Canadian and Russian ships, but OP made it seem like there was genuinely a cause for concern.  Imagine if mainstream media outlets reported this story in the same manner.  There would be mass hysteria.. I dunno, the title made me think of those stories where Canadians can own a gun, but the ammo has to be locked away from the firearm.  I didnt really see it as an anti-Russian thing but more of a Canadians crazy gun laws extend to the military kind of sentiment. . Don't know where you heard that ammo has to be locked away from guns in Canada, but that's not really true. Your guns just need to be locked up and you just can't have a gun stored loaded. The ammo and guns can be locked up together in the same container.. Gotcha, I knew there was something like that, but yea, my first thought was this was a commentary on gun laws rather than anti-Russian propaganda.

Yeah but they also terroristed the shit out of Turkey, so as far as Turkeys concerned, they can shoot in every direction.. People really do not understand the three way deadlock here. Turkey loses soldiers and civilians to the Kurdish terrorism organizations as well as Islamic terrorism organizations. In a year 15+ attacks in total have been occured in Turkey from both sides.They neither can side with the peshmerga or ISIS.. It's almost like the world isn't black and white like Reddit thinks.. It'a almost like the Kurds have no state and Turkey is a major reason why. Watch first world children think that b-buht they are violent so they are bad. Turks rn are just frustrated their green terrorists are losing hard, need to find more ways to support them    . Neither Syria, Turkey, Iraq or Iran support a Kurdish state and it's those countries where a supposed Kurdish (landlocked) state would exist. It's not happening although Turkey has actually been more open to an independent Kurdistan based on the current borders of the Kurdish Regional Government. The Iraqi army has quashed any chances of this however with a recent invasion.. I don't argue the others are better. None of those tyrants want to give up a piece of their land.. The only way it's going to happen though is with their permission. If they unilaterally declare independence they will immediately be blockaded and besieged by their neighbours and they don't have a coastline.

Still waiting for the crumbs to fall.... Australia have one of the worlds most free markets and the worlds 8th highest salaries, higher than Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland and so many others, and three of the nations who make more than Australia are either tax havens or oil states. Australians make plenty. . Australia's exceptionally strong economy is due to relative abundance of natural resources to population size. In its current form, the economy won't sustain these wages long term.. Yes, they do have a lot of natural resources, almost as much as Nigeria and Congo and similar very rich nations. . This is a dumb comment, there's a lot more to what makes a country have a high standard of living than just the natural resource endowment. . Not according to nesh34. . I think you misunderstood the point of my comment. I was giving a reason for why wages were higher in Australia than Western Europe whilst standard of living being similar.   I wasn't suggesting Australia only has natural resources and nothing else. I fully expect the economy to adapt and become less reliant on these over time, something I don't expect to happen in the Middle East for example.

I just dont want to be lumped in with a group of people that dont give a shit about the countries future.  In a real democracy we would have President Clinton.  And the we would be dealing with her arguing with Congress over dumb shit. Which would be much better than what we have now.. Uh if it were a popular vote then Trump would have run his campaign differently. . Clinton would have too.  There still would have been no way for Trump to win. Where was he going to find another 3 million votes?. You literally have no idea how a different voting system would affect voting patterns. Some dems might not have voted, more repubs May have voted.

Maybe the bureaucracy of their culture used sacrifice as an excuse to deal with what may have been an issue of overpopulation.. Or because sacrafice is a common religious ritual. Early cultures who participated in religious sacrifice are painted as savages because of these rituals that were not entirely uncommon worldwide. Yes the Aztec Empire participated in human sacrafice (debatable but the commonly held belief) but they were an advanced civilization far beyond their shortcomings that seems to not be recognized :(. Sacrificing Humans over superstition is savage, no matter how you slice it. Moral relativism is a pretty unsustainable philosophy and the sooner we're done with it the better for everyone.

He isn't wrong, Christians in the middle east suffer more than muslims and they should be helped first as they are the ones in more danger.. Pretty sure the ultra majority of terrorism related deaths are Muslim . Pretty sure the ultra majority of terrorists are muslim in those areas where the ultra majority of the population is also muslim.  Imagine how they feel about the christian ultra minority then and how you should compare the number of deaths in absolute or relative terms and how will you measure mistreatment.. How about we just worry about helping humans regardless of religion. . Nah. I think we should be trying to get the people out of there most likely to die. . Thats all the people.  . Don't be thick. Some groups are more likely to get dead than others. . Its a bad place.

Trump attacks the media and wants change laws to sue them for reporting the news. Thats not what freedom looks like. . We had a perfect demonstration of democracy with the election of trump . If it was a perfect demonstration of democracy then the candidate with the most votes would win. Spoiler alert: Trump would have lost by 3 million votes. . It was a peaceful transition of power, the minority ended up being represented, observers noticed nothing funny. Sounds like a good democracy to me. US is no longer a full democracy, EIU warns:  https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/25/us-is-no-longer-a-full-democracy-eiu-warns.html. The USA was never a full democracy. The USA is a Constitutional Republic. The USA was specifically designed in a way to not be democratic. Literally every decision is subordinate to the Constitution. I'm not even American but this is basic civics.. Yeah Im sure the EIU has no idea about that. A random redditor surely knows more. You should write them a letter. They should hire you!

Boteach seems to be entirely clueless to how bad he makes us all look, and how his kind of extremism is shooting himself in the foot.  It brings the opposite reaction from those he would want to educate.. He doesn't want to educate, he is just as bigoted as those he accuses of being bigots.  He is nothing more than an anti Arab/Muslim jew... if he was in a position that control military he would likely be as bad as Hitler towards the religion. . The same thing is happening all over the place: Myanmar, Middle America, the EU, the UK, Northeast Asia...even the most peaceful religions and most educated societies are falling victim to bigotry and ideological extremism.. That's just what religion does generally. It won't stop until it is completely eliminated. After all, I'd rather be fighting over some new system of government rather than some tribal god-images.. Yeah, but the bigots arising recently in the west these days are \often non-religious. It doesn't stop them being bigots.   Some of them are even anti-religion in general and make bigoted Reddit posts claiming that religion itself inherently/generally causes bigotry and it won't stop until religion is totally eliminated.. >make bigoted Reddit posts claiming that religion itself inherently/generally causes bigotry and it won't stop until religion is totally eliminated.

Israel treats Palestinians with respect and care. But Palestinians wont stop killing Israeli children and women. Palestinians need to drop weapons for peace. . Oh bullshit.  Respect and care, you mean like setting up checkpoints that are moved overnight to encompass inhabited zones?. Palestinians are 100% to blame for the checkpoints. You're right, there is absolutely no way that those illegal colonies that israel keeps building after expelling palestinians could at all be responsible of the ongoing violence!  israel never did anything wrong, right?. Stopped caring at first suicide bomber terrorist. Fuck em. Did you stop caring about the freedom and security of Israelis after the first Zionist terrorist attack?

The only thing thing turkish want is to live in peace and for that YPG need to leave our borders, it doesn.t matter what are their ethnic origin when your ambition is to target the peace of a country you are a terrorist before having an ethnicity.. I think turkey wants to believe that, but its not 100% accurate.. It is accurate, just look to the events about Kobani operation, where do you think all the people of the town has been evacuated ?. I dont believe youre a bad person. I do believe you deserve all the peace in the world.  I do however believe your government has track record of aggressively suppressing any opposition that don't  abide to their agenda.  . Of course. Cause innocent Turkish civilians being killed by these terrorist groups is not a part of our agenda.

What would be your explanation for that?  It seems extremely hard to even talk about this development without being yelled it for racism.  I saw similar things in East Africa where Indians are running many successful businesses, despite being only a small minority of the population.. Because the white farmers are educated and have experience running efficient large farms. Sub saharan Africans have never really had large farms like that.  Farming is a skill thats passed down through many generations and something a lot of people go to university for. You cant just buy a tractor and be successful.. > Sub saharan Africans have never really had large farms like that.  Especially because under the colonial governments, there were massive restrictions on natives owning land.  Under the Rhodesian land system the natives (who were about 98.6% of the population) were allocated a mere 22% as native reserves.  And to the surprise of no one, it was the shittest 5th of land they got stuck with.. That's not true, the land that was not tribal was split about 50/50 between the black and white population. (Though that was still of course unfair, with whites only making up 8% of the population). Source for that 8% claim?

He announced to a group of super-duper-mega-Christians that he studied the Bible extensively and his favourite passage was Two Corinthians (sic) - not Second Corinthians - *two* Corinthians.  In a heart-warming display of Christian Charity, the audience dismissed the idea that he was a charlatan and a huckster and instead embraced him as their new Messiah, and here we are.. Interesting. When I was a Christian I always called it Two Corinthians. I must have just been a bad Christian, which is probably why I'm a pagan now lol.

It's OK, they'll fall back to extortion, prostitution, kidnapping, and weapons smuggling.  The modern cartel is well-diversified against shocks to the system and they're organized. So much so that they should just incorporate themselves, begin legally bribing politicians, and claim tax deductions for their activities.. Well we can at least make things difficult for them by taking out some of their revenue sources. . I don't think they make much money from marijuana. Isn't it the more serious drugs like cocaine?. I'm not sure, but I encourage the legalization of all drugs. . Because increasing the amount of junkies and addicts are what neighborhoods need.

I have been lectured many times on Reddit by decriminalization advocates that legalization is not the same as decriminalization.  You wrote legalize all drugs.  The study is about decriminalization.  Even then, they impose fines and limits on how much one can possess.  No country has legalized all drugs.

The least effective action would be an attempt to curtail Free Speech in the USA.. They already did that second one with trump . The entire establishment is having a brown trouser moment, not just Trump's half. None of them are talking about doing anything remotely useful or effective.. Yeah Republicans have been useless for like 20 years. At least in 2020 we will have actual leaders back. . Very few establishment voices have ever proposed anything remotely useful or effective on this topic going back to the hacker crackdown of the late 1980's. Many of them have been selling snake oil to us though. The problem for us is that the snake oil doesn't work and it's killing our economy.. Kinda. The problem comes from the Republicans lack of leadership for the people. . You are trying to lay the blame for this catastrophe at the feet of one US political party when it is actually a consequence of the establishment's decades long policy of pursuing of its own narrowly defined self interest all around the globe. . They're not all one team man. The blame rests squarely on the Neocons and failed republican policy.

And no lottery system right? And this is the exact system trump is trying to emulate with proposed immigration reform....right? . If Trump copy-pasted Canada's system, we would increase our 1 mil immigration to 3 mil per year.  He wants to cut it in half to 500k.  That is by far the most objectionable part of his plans, and for many GOP senators like Graham. I have no problem with more skilled and less family based. But the severe cut is a non-starter.. >But the severe cut is a non-starter.  Why?.  Because you know. We owe immigrants the right to come this country for some reason.  . Yes because everyone who is there now got there due to immigration.. There's one very large minority group who wouldn't be included in your inaccurate statement. Think about it.. They immigrated from asia like 14000 years ago. There's another even larger group. How they got here wouldn't exactly be called immigration, or voluntary.

t3_7v7tlj	0	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. probably because Canadian immigration is based on merit, you need skills to come in, as it should be. . Or money, sadly..  Money = merit and when talking about immigration merit refers to how they can better and contribute to society.  So no its not sad if a rich person comes to Canada.. What absolute nonsense. In some cities in Canada, people are 'blessed' with rich immigrants, which do not integrate into society and remain cliquey. Whether you can integrate and contribute to society has nothing to do with money and should never be a criteria.. Im pretty sure the person paying $100k in taxes is contributing to society more than the person receive $10k in welfare.   Plus its easier to integrate in society when you can buy their products and services than when you have to buy the cheapest stuff to survive. . So the amount of taxes you pay is a measure of how well you contribute to society? That is sad.. What measure do you want to use? Id say taxes+money spent is how much someone contributes.   Its not sad that its a logical metric to use. And Im also not saying we should just get rid of everyone who doesnt contribute. . It's skill, knowledge of language and willingness to integrate. This is how immigration works in most countries. The money way gets abused more than often, and there are prime examples for it.

People can't have a different opinion to me, so it must be Russia  The sad thing is, this post is going to be heavily upvoted because of Muh Russia and the Anti-Trump and Anti-Brexit echo chamber that this website has become.  . Yeah, why would Russia ever try and weaken western Europe and the US. /s. You can't have it both ways.  One moment it's Russia hates the US and wants to destroy us then it's Trump's getting a LITTLE too friendly with Russia omg!!.  Delusion.. Those two things you listed are not mutually exclusive.  Trump and Putin's relationship has nothing to do with strengthening ties and everything to do with getting what each other wants, like how Trump has decided to not sanction Russia despite the fact that Congress voted to do so and Trump has sold property to a Russian oligarch for far more than what it's worth.. Thats what you do when selling property, if possible you sell for more than its worth.. He sold it for $50 million over the $40 million value of the property.   During the 2008 recession.  To a Russian oligarch.   I'm sure that's just Trump being a good business man and the Russian billionaire just being naive.  And all the other connections between him and Russian oligarchs are probably all just huge coincidences as well. /s. Yeah, you're ignoring how, a decade ago, trump had no idea he would go into politics; As far as anyone can tell, it was just a savvy deal.. Trump has expressed publicly his desire to run for president as far back as 1987 and for basically every election since then.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Political_career_up_to_2015  Even if he didn't want to run for president, which he did, there are any number of deals he could have made with a Russian oligarch in exchange for $50 million.

Will we see EU government's requiring Facebook allow users to use their service anyhow under the argument that it is too much of a burden to be denied use of a service that is integral in many people's lives?. Absolutely correct - websites will simply lock you out of their content if you refuse to opt in for user tracking: if the letter of the law is followed its going to be a shit show   I cant wait! .

Especially in Jakarta - I mean it looks like this might have been a structural issue, but that wouldn't have been my first thought.. Holy shit, a group of high school kids were standing on it when it collapsed:    https://twitter.com/adharves/status/952842135039963136?s=09  How are they not dead?. Who says some aren't? Definitely seemed like someone would have died there unfortunately. News still isn't reporting any deaths as far as I can tell.. It doesn't look too high off the ground to really cause death, unless of course it collapsed on top of somebody because that might possibly kill them.. Nope, no deaths. Crazy, right? I can barely believe it. Permalink to my primary comment citing this in an article: [reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7qhr1w/indonesia_stock_exchange_floor_collapses_many/dsporto/). Damn, that's pretty amazing nobody died. I mean, there were basically crowds of people just having the floor under that drop, yet they all got out with just injuries?. Not only that, it also *fell on top of some people* yet no deaths reported so far.

I was surprised to see an actual floor had collapsed.. The title took me reading for awhile, didnt expect literal floor to collapse.. Why did you think they used they literal word floor though. Because that's an economic term. My thought process: - What is the stock floor? It has to be zero.  - That cant collapse. Must be the actual floor of the exchange. . Casualties, might refer to hurt feelings. Oh wait, people died.. You must not know much about the history of stock exchanges. Lots of people used to off themselves if they went bankrupt or the whole exchange went tits up

Love affair with social media may be over, reputation damaged by fake news scandals, the spread of extremist propaganda and child safety issues.. It's the media outlets' fault: not fact checking, printing opinion as fact, pushing agendas, clickbait, etc.  Congratulations media, you played yourselves.. Not just the media but anyone who is a part of the online discussion. We're acting as media right now. It's why things like shilling are effective. . I disagree: we're citizens, not members of the fourth estate. Journalist, publication, etc. should mean something - or else why are we giving them the time of day?. Journalism school should be like passing law school.. Bingo. Make journalist a protected title, introduce a bar exam, and disbar those who sully the name.. Although I agree with you, the problem is that people arent willing to pay for news anymore. Lawyers are $100 an hour just to sit and talk with. Society has come to expect the news for free, but expects the same quality as when every house in America had a newspaper subscription. . >people arent willing to pay for news anymore  Kind of my point: the reputation of news is now quite literally worthless - so they should be treated as such (i.e. not believed without plenty of evidence and sources named)..

t3_7oiq4q	0	*	German conservatives to propose deporting anti-Semitic migrants. What's the definition of anti-Semitism. If it's as loose as including criticism of Israel (as defined by AIPAC and other lobby groups) then this is a stupid idea.. I've always wondered this too, especially considering the only Semitic people this ever applies to are Jewish, even though most Semitic people aren't Jewish.. That's just because of the definition of the word antisemetism. It was coined to specifically target Jews while including those of the ethnicity who may not be religious Jews. It wasn't constructed properly from an etymological standpoint, but that's still the word's definition.. It strips arabs and other Semitic people of their ethnic identity, so it's a problematic word.. And the word lesbian strips away the identity of people from Lesbos but I don't hear anyone from Lesbos complaining about it either.. [No it doesn't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbos). >[No it doesn't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbos)  Demonym: Lesbian. It's right there.  If you're gonna post evidence to support your argument, you should at least read what you're posting.. Except that nobody from the island has ever referred to themselves as Lesbians, so no. 
t3_7oiq4q	1	*	German conservatives to propose deporting anti-Semitic migrants. Under this legislation to question the right of existence of Israel would be grounds for deportation?. Yes, that was explicitely mentioned.  > Wer jxfcdisches Leben in Deutschland ablehnt oder das Existenzrecht Israels infrage stellt, kann keinen Platz in unserem Land haben.  Whoever denies Jews their life in Germany or questiones the right of existence of Israel cannot have a place in our country.. So you can be deported for having a 'wrong' opinion on Israel? That's nuts . Germany has an understandably conscientious attitude when it comes to discussing Israel and its right to exist. . They should have an even more conscientious attitude towards the right of free speech. It's not even like it's hate speech it's literally just stating an opinion about a highly controversial part of history. . Perhaps so, but as others here have noted, there isn't a fundamental right to free speech in Germany so its a moot point. Anything that can be even tangentially construed as advocating genocide against Jews is essentially outlawed.. Glad I don't live in Germany then tbh, how can anyone defend banning an opinion? I thought they had a fairly progressive government before now . They are not citizens, they don't have the same rights Germans have. A German citizen can have any opinion they want, but Germany is under no obligation to let in millions of people with opinions that could harm the way of life in Germany.
t3_7oiq4q	1	*	German conservatives to propose deporting anti-Semitic migrants. Seems fair and a good middle ground for everyone.  People who dont like migrants can deport some of the worst of them and people who dont like hate spewing bigots get rid of a couple of them.. yeah, the law seems fair. The problem is if they count antizionism as antisemitism or not? For example, when they burned Israeli flags in protests, the German president said it's antisemtic while it was only directed towards Israels not jews.. And then there's the other way around, where [an attack on a synagogue isn't antisemetism.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/13/german-court-rules-synagogue-torching-not-anti-sem/). yeah, you're correct if you're burning a temple of a religion you're sure as hell acting against it. This is the problem both sides try to cloud the definition to their advantage.. When Jews say something is anti-Semitism, we tell them that they are wrong. When black people say something is racism, we listen.   Arguing about the definition of antisemitism is a common tactic of antisemites. If the antisemite gets to define the term then it's easier to try and deny that hate such even happens.. Black people can be wrong about racism, also. Take a look around tumblrinaction, it happens often.. I'm more interested why there's a special word for hating Jews while hating all other ethnicity is lumped into just 'racist'.. judaism is both a cultural identity and a religion- you can be born jewish or convert to it at any time. that's not the case with most ethnic groups.

Some lobbies try to define the opposition to Israel as antisemitism.. Well there is a difference between burning flags on the streets and just simply disliking Israel.. if the flags are your own property and not public property, what is the problem?.

The difference being that in the US the government doesn't force people to wear hijabs.   So if women choose to wear them, good for them. If they choose not to wear it, good for them.  Point of the article is that in Iran the women don't get a choice.

I suggest you listen to women who choose to wear the hijab and their reasons before why before likening them to slaves. . My point is.

Of course the hijab seems like a great thing when you're told it's the only thing stopping men from raping you. . Have you actually heard women say why they choose to wear the hijab?

That's not the 'new' part.  A re-entry vehicle that can maneuver in the atmosphere, like the Space Shuttle or X-37B, is harder to protect against than an inert object falling on a ballistic arc.  Atmospheric maneuverability and propulsion during final descent onto the target area is new.. Meh? Does that even matter. . It does much matter. Terminal manoeuvring helps avoid counters.. At mach 10-20 what maneuvering?. Enough to dodge THADD? Considering the interception vehicle has to mirror the manouvers.. Have you played missile command?  Think of the path of an ICBM as a cone that gets longer and narrower the faster it goes.  An interceptor only needs to fire at a point it can intercept the ICBM no matter where it maneuvers.  . I haven't played missile command.   The cone thing makes sense to me. But wouldn't the narrow cone also be much longer because the speed is higher? How does this make intercepting easier?. Yes- you get the cone idea.  The faster the missle goes the lower its ability to alter it's trajectory because other wise it will spin out of control/break apart.  It's basic physics to plot an intercept, with minor adjustments to make the intercept easier.

When has that ever been the case in a mass shooting though? . IDK. Another redditor, who may or may not be on the same side of the issue as I am, noted how difficult it is to find out the source of the weapons used in school shootings - even though you'd think that would be, you know, something important to have data on before you make policy.. It is in some cases. Generally not reported whenever the guns weren't bought from a dealer, as there is no paper trail. Which is why a lot of people on the right try to use as a way to say they were illegally aquired, which I don't think is the case. A lot of time it is a family members and there is no paper trail to follow it.. >which I don't think is the case.   What leads you think this?. Its pretty tough for a kid in high school, or just out of high school to have the connections necessary to illegal aquire a gun like that. For example: the Sandy Hook shooter took the gun from his mom.
t3_7zf342	1	*	In a rare example of breaking with diplomatic niceties, the PM of Denmark is publicly urging President Trump to respond to the outcry that has followed the latest mass shooting in the U.S. Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump needs to listen to the students demonstrating in support of tighter gun control. I thought we didn't like foreign governments interfering in our politics?. Literally nobody has said foreign governments cant have a public stance on our internal affairs.. It is actually unusual for friendly nations to comment directly on domestic policy. Trump has constantly commented on other nations affairs. Im sure he can take it. . The point.      Your head.. Actully I dont think the PM would have made that remark if it wasnt for Trump and the fact the he is so unpopular he can score some homepoints by doing this. . Thats exactly my point. Trump is so undignified he has changed the rules.. Ah right.

Seen on Twitter:  A week ago Congress was asking Tide to change their pod designs so that teenagers would stop eating them.  Now this week the media thinks teenagers should determine gun control laws.  Anyway, since the vast majority of these school shootings are done by minors, obviously the solution is to ban firearms ownership by those under 18. Or 21, if you want.. The laws already are 18 a for a rifle and shotgun, 21 for a hand gun.  It's a matter of enforcing the laws already on the books.. >The laws already are 18 a for a rifle and shotgun, 21 for a hand gun.  Not quite. On the Federal level, *dealers* can't sell to people under 18/21 respectively. But Grandpa can *give* you a shotgun or a rifle for Christmas, and there's no minimum age for long-gun ownership.  http://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2014/08/when-can-kids-legally-own-shoot-guns.html. I really have no clue how gun laws work in the US. But I always assumed ownership and license were personal, surely grandpa can't give his grandson a gun? Or am I wrong, I would happily be corrected as I only base this on my European perception of common sense. . Gramps gave me a .22 rifle when I was 8. Was shooting the .30-06 by 10 years old.. I lost3. Teeths when i shot a garand when i was 9. Never busted my face but I'll admit I got some good scope eye the very first time shooting the 30-06..

Studies have already shown torture isn't an effective interrogation tool, USA has taken a non-torture stand on the world stage and actually said we've stopped torturing prisoners. . I think of torture as more of a deterrent than an interrogation tool.. Sane people think of torture as a disgusting abomination and violation of human rights.. I dont think the people they are doing it to are human. Hopefully you get tortured one day. . I dont plan on aiding terrorists anytime soon so I think I will be ok.. Yeah neither have some of the people there. They still get tortured. So we have direct proof that you're not 'ok'  Hope you get tortured one day.. My landlord wont fix my heater at its 26 degrees in my house right now so hope that gives you comfort.
t3_7u6k49	1	*	Trump signs executive order to keep Guantanamo Bay prison open. There are a lot of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay who haven't even been convicted of anything but are being held under suspicion. It's sick. . Guantanamo also holds children behind bars.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_juveniles_held_at_the_Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp. What the fuck. Don't make the mistake of thinking that 'juveniles' means children who *couldn't* have been involved in anything.  In Afghan culture and in Iraq when a boy is 12 he is seen as being a man, with the responsibilities and obligations that a man has.  Which means that handing him a rifle to go shoot people is acceptable to them, having him make bombs is acceptable.. I feel like it's up to us to dismantle that monstrous philosophy instead of torturing children. My two cents.. > I feel like it's up to us to dismantle that monstrous philosophy  That is the 'white man's burden' style of thinking, where the subject of the statement are 'too immature' to take care of themselves.  It the cause of so much chaos in the Middle East.  We really should step back and keep our hands off, let them grow up on their own.. And you're keeping your hands off and letting then grow up on their own by kidnapping them from the Middle East and taking them to Cuba to be tortured?     It's the 'white mans' (because apparently every American is white) 'burden' because they made it their burden.  Wow, such a burden to be criticized for imprisoning children who are victims of a situation.. America isn't under an obligation to enlighten the cultural standards of the third world. That is ironically racist itself. If an Afghan 12 year old can be a real man and fuck a goat, shoot a rifle and marry - Why imperialistically change that?  Cultural relativism is a bitch when it is personally inconvenient for your own beliefs huh?

t3_81elz6	1	*	Teenager jailed for life for planned terror attack on Justin Bieber gig. >A teenager who planned an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack on a pop concert a month after the Manchester Arena bombing has been given a life sentence and told he will serve at least 11 years in prison before being considered for parole.  so he'll probably be out before his 30. At a perfectly ripe age to keep doing God's work...    I hesitate to say he shouldn't be released, ever, but... I can't shake the feeling that, being incarcerated for as long as he has lived so far, will only compel him more. He will get out with only more anger than when he went in. Not the case for everyone. Guy I know went away 4 years for attempted Murder, came out vowing to do whatever he has to not go to back to prison because its so awful. But this is an Islamic extremist we're talking about. UK prisons have a serious problem of Islamic radicalisation.. >In the witness box, Gunton said he did not possess a copy of the Quran, did not believe in Islam and ate ham.  The kid's name is Lloyd Gunton and suffers from an autism spectrum disorder.   My bet isn't on him becoming even more radicalized in prison.. His name has nothing to do with his religious beliefs, and his being vaguely mentally disabled also doesn't really instill confidence that he'll deradicalize. He planned a terrorist attack, stated he was a soldier of Islam, and even understands the jiahidst meme of stabbing infidels in the neck. He is a terrorist. His being a white kid doesn't change that.. No, no. White people are mental health victims, brown people are terrorists   /s
t3_7w2qor	1	*	Morgue worker sacked for having sex with corpse of murdered TV stars corpse. > Alexander cannot be punished for his deed, as there is no Russian law that deals with such incidents  I don't know whether it's good that there is no law because it is so uncommon or bad because he will go unpunished.. Well he was fired so its not like he got off completely scot free.   This feels like one of these things you want to discourage for the sake of the berieved but cant really justify punishing too harshly either since its a victimless crime. I am ok with it being the employers responsibility to discourage the indecent treatment of corpses.. Indecent or disrespectful treatment of human remains is not a victimless crime.. Seems victimless to me. The feelings  of family members may be hurt but it's a leap to consider them victims. Actually it's technically wrong to call them victims and disrespectful to actual victims. . So, if your SO died and someone else had sex with his or her's body, you would not feel you are a victim?   Directly I guess you are not phsyically a victim of that crime.  But if you felt zero emotional repercussions to that situation then you have to be sociopathic.. A lot of people get their feelings hurt all the time. That does not mean that they should be considered victims in a legal sense. . So how would you feel if someone just shot your dog right in front of you? You're not a victim, your dog was, right? . I believe that the dog can be a victim to a crime and that the person who shot the dog should be punished. Hurting an animal is not immoral because it upsets their owner, it is illegal because the animal suffers from it.

I'd have preferred him to 5 years of Rudd and Gillard scrambling for top spot on the greasy totum without a care for the nation.. so you prefered a pm that had a habbit of selling everything thats not bolted to the ground.

Wait, how is this remotely a fee fees thing? Observing severe respiratory issues in an artificially made breed is not some sort of emotional liberal conspiracy. . the TLDR of this article is: 'dont own these dogs because they have trouble breathing, so breeders stop making them'  its specifically trying to prevent pugs from being bred. Literally an attempt at hashtagging a dog breed into extinction.  Tell me how you dont see this as a fee fees issue. . Preventing suffering is logical. Unless you don't even value your own suffering. I can have 0 emotional attachment to a person or animal and still logically conclude that their suffering should be avoided.  *Breeds* of dogs don't suffer. Only individuals suffer. And this suffering can be prevented by not breeding them into a painful existence in the first place.. so, because it has a deformity, it shouldnt be allowed to live then?   . No, no one is saying euthanize all living brachycephalic dogs. Breeding more of them knowing the offspring will have the deformities which cause them to suffer and have poor quality of life is what's wrong.. bhokay- i guess we should tell people who have asthma that they cant have kids now. makes sense right? i mean why needlessly have children that will have breathing issues. its just cruel right?   . No, but we shouldn't be making people breed that have a high chance of having a child with a deformity.   Actually, we shouldn't be *making* people breed at all.

Can someone please ELI5 how Trump is still in office? Seems like every day there's a new headline damning him yet nothing happens. . Republicans are protecting him because he signs whatever they put on his desk.. Doubt it. Pence would do the same thing and not be so retarded in the mean time.. Yep. But the GOP is afraid of the Trump base. So, when you break it down, the entire country is basically being held hostage by a faction of Trumpists. How do we fix that? I dunno. . It's because it's a group of people that if appeased are a guaranteed vote in your favor. Dems seemingly try to appeal to groups that don't reliably vote in all elections, like young people and certain minority groups. They need to get the groups that support them in the booths as well as try to attract moderate conservatives that are sick of the Republican party.. Unfortunately won't work.  The major wedge issue in America is abortion.  Trump would probably not have been elected had Antonin Scalia not died, forcing many voters to decide between the lives of unborn nucleic acids and Mr. Cotton Candy Hair.  . That analysis is fascinating to me. Why do so many people care so much about abortion while seeming to care so little about overall reproductive health?. Abortion is murder, plain and simple.    Reproductive health is choice.  If you can't afford it, you probably made terrible life decisions and are poor.  That's your fault.

Sounds like children being able to play in a park is more important to you than a homeless person's well being.. And it sounds like you think parks are better used for adults to drink and use drugs than for children to have fun.  You know, homeless shelters are a thing.. A child not being able to play in a park does not outrank a homeless person's wellbeing, sleep or whatever.  If a homeless person would rather sleep on a park bench than in a homeless shelter then that should tell you something about the quality and availability of homeless shelters.

I'm ok with this kind of thing in the interest of keeping public parks safe but it needs to be paired with good funding for homeless shelters along with aid and mental health programs to get these people on their feet.. Unfortunately, many chronic homeless (the kind that is likely to be sleeping on park benches), have mental health problems that prevent them from getting on their feet.  Severe, chronic mental illness isn't always something you can overcome.. There are a significant number of rough sleepers in the UK who don't want accommodation for various reasons.  I know someone who works for a homeless charity and they get calls all the time about the same people.  They go out and offer help and a place off the street but there's no interest in taking it.. Im not certain of the UK, but in the US, its often due to the poor quality of security. They have their things stolen, theyre mistreated or pitied instead of motivated or aided. Its a difficult sector of care that doesnt get the proper attention or funding when it comes to our side of the pond. Does your friend have any insight or reasoning as to why they turn them down?. I've been told not to go to shelters due to the likelihood of me being raped. The police told me this after I asked to be driven to one to get out of an abusive home. I'm older now and I've been thinking of going anyway if I get told to leave where I am now. . I wonder if men who bitch about women's-only shelters realize this^. Who bitches about women's only shelters?    The problem is not being allowed to have men's only shelters as well.. People do. But I believe men should have more places to go with their kids if they need to.

The nice thing about facts is they don't care what we think or feel. Only suppression of facts causes us to think or feel things about a subject rather than know.. Yes but we have different views of the facts which I find interesting and is the only point I was making. The facts only point one way. You think it's a conspiracy because you want it to be. . Hillary Clinton and the DNC hid their payments to a former foreign spy who used his sources in Russian intelligence to put together opposition research on a political opponent and use it to get a warrant to spy on at least one member of the campaign in an attempt to discredit a democratically elected leader of our government.   ...almost sounds like Russian collusion.. Yeah.. almost. Pretty much exactly, honestly.

First Lorde gets all that hate for boycotting Israel, but now they turn around and do this.. I love how they act like the perpetual underdog against Palestine.

Except the underdog thing is over the entire Arab and Muslim world. And the whole apartheid thing is a bunch of nonsense. . The gating and armed control of Palestinian areas is definitely not nonsense and is in fact very similar to apartheid.. Yea, I remember when the white South Africans gave the black areas full national autonomy and the ability to democratically elect their own government.  True. Moron.. Hardly, Israel doesn't even recognise Palestine as a state and still has military control over Palestine. Full national autonomy.. Israel does NOT have military control over Palestine....not even remotely..... Israel Blockades Gaza, though.  Blockades are military actions that effectively control the borders of a country.  I mean your argument is going nowhere. Even Israel admits it's blockading Gaza.

Just because there are countries doing worse things than Israel or the US is doing, doesn't mean they can't be criticized.. Isreal is a complicated shitthole.  You can look at both the isrealies and the Palestinians and find so much bad blood. Whose worse? I don't know. It's just a bad situation.  Isreal, for better or for worse is not goin anywhere. Both sides are going to have to accept that and figure something out.. This like when someone gets a parasite and tries to fight it off and people are like Nah brah that parasite is staying just accept that he is sucking your blood. . Just thought you'd like to know Israel would be the parasite in your metaphor since Zionism didn't become a thing til the late 19th century. The Palestinians had already inhabited the land for a couple thousand years.  I agree with that sentiment for sure, but don't think that's quite what you're going for.. The guy before me said  > Isreal, for better or for worse is not goin anywhere.  My metaphor was a reaction to that, so yeah I meant Isreal as the parasite.  . Ah, that's my bad. Should've read a bit more carefully. Just sick of people portraying Palestinians as a *thing* to be dealt with.

Disagree with them and you're an anti semite.. Yeah, American people's will to support Israel is pretty shocking. There's a significant difference between anti-Semitism and anti-israel that a lot of people don't understand.. It's such a shame that a discussion can't be had. If you acknowledge that Israel might not be 100% blameless, suddenly anyone that disagrees with you says you're on the Palestinian's side but I'm on neither side. Neither side is blameless and until we can acknowledge that nothing will ever gets solved.  Unfortunately I think a lot of politicians are OK with that because votes.. To be fair, and like others have said, a lot of peoples criticism is just an excuse to be anti Semitic and rag on the Jews.

There's a constant political struggle in between more liberal and secular groups and more conservative and more orthodox groups just like there is in any other democratic country. It's not weird that some organizations will act in spite of the government actions.. I'm not sure that liberal and conservative are useful terms anymore. It's more like people who embrace others and people who want to commit genocide if only we'd let them.. Yeah dude the ~50% of people that disagree with you politically all want to commit genocide, that's literally the only reason somebody wouldn't be liberal!. What happens when conservatives are in charge?. Pretty much the same bullshit that America inflicts on the rest of the world when liberals are in control, they just don't try to appease the other side of the political spectrum.. Libertarian?. Actually I'm mostly liberal in my political ideology. Libertarianism isn't really much of a thing here other than the one seat David Seymour has!

If you wouldnt want that you can send me a check for the amount Id be glad to have it.  . We get it, you like handouts.. Clearly you dont.  I dont want handouts at all Im just appreciative of keeping more of the money i EARNED to begin with is all.  Apparently the commies dont like it so I said Id be happy to have theirs as well considering they love sharing.  . > I don't want handouts at all  Then  > I'd be happy to have theirs as well  You're not even consistent within a single comment.

Not funding the leech class anymore. . What do you want to get in return for your taxes? . Considering I see no benefit in federal taxes outside of military spending nothing. Outside of that, cut, cut, cut any and every program that costs more than it can generate.  And you can save the but dont use the roads cliche nonsense. My federal tax dollars dont pay for roads, my property taxes do. Two separate and distinct funding sources, two seperate issues. . Reparations are owed to the poverty stricken in the inner cities. These reparations come in form of social programs and assistance.. Yeah, well I support gutting and closing said programs as is happening now.   Nothing is owed to anyone.. You are clearly not an economist.. Neither are you.

One, I dont think they will, there nothing keeping them from matching or doing more right now and Two, so what. You know how much you can do w 32B?. Its a little over a billion a year? And most of that funding is earmarked for specific goods. Like them buying American weapons, and food. Foreign aid is one of the best investments we make. We pretty much get it all back and it buys us a lot of diplomatic influence. . Its not a great investment when a huge chunk of it goes to funding terrorism.. Is it a great investment when DoD money goes to funding terrorism? Do you remember how many arms the US supplied to syrian terrorist groups over the last couple years? How about when they supplied the Osamas Mujahideen? Or the dozens of other groups in between?. Some of the local tax money we pay goes to police that terrorize the black community.  Based on your logic, we should stop funding all police across the country.

They did not trust Pakistan not to try to sabotage the mission. They're a sanctuary country for terrorists.. Obama just had an funny interview over in India where the interviewer kept trying to get him to admit that Pakistans excuse for Osama was bullshit lol . Got a link? That sounds interesting.. https://youtu.be/FrdnO0AOk_g. Great find. Very awkward at the end. Why is Obama so afraid to be critical? Seems like he is protecting Pakistan which makes me wonder if Trump now knows something contradictory to Obama's response that there was no evidence of Pakistan knowing anything. Seems like common sense that they had to know which is why I give the interviewer serious props on asking the question.. Because if a former president publicly announced that we had cassus belli with a country, it could be considered diplomatically awkward (bit like Jimmy Carter declaring war on Uruguay or something).  That's a pre-2016 mindset though, he should just let fly, I mean at this point just fuck it really.

It's not a well thought out plan, bribes don't last forever, China is filling up that hole now, so all that money given is now dust. China is smarter about it, they're not giving money, they're investing on a big risky project. If it works, China gets money and profit, if it doesn't Pakistan becomes indebted and are forced to do whatever China tells them to do.. How will the US get supplies into Afghanistan? Teleport them in?. That 32 billion was since Pakistan was created, initially it was to fight communism. If they were smart about it they could have done what China did, invest instead of giving money just like that.

Call me crazy, but I kind of dig having a president who, a lot of the time, says what he feels in the moment with no filter.  It's a nice dose of reality and humanism.  It's quite refreshing when you consider how filtered and pre-approved all previous Presidents' communications with the public were.. To be fair, those filters were there for several reasons. A President should absolutely seek counsel and consider the full ramifications of a statement before making one. He isn't just some guy on twitter. His actions have immediate and far-reaching consequences.. In addition, he picks the dumbest fights, like random stuff he decides to go in about on Twitter.  Honestly, if he just didn't use Twitter, I think his approval ratings would be 8 points higher. He's actually done a decent job on office, if he just shuts up. Once in awhile he tweets something that's actually really good, but vast majority is either impulsively and/or about stupid things.. Decent? How the standards have plummeted.. I mean, not really. I honestly think he's done a decent jobs compared to other presidents, has it been great? No, but at the end of 2017 he started getting more things done and if it continues to 2018 it might be a pretty good presidency.

No ones particularly fond but if we don't play this right we could lose assets & strategic power. Talk is cheap, what's his plan?. He likely already has a plan in the works - if you haven't noticed his rhetoric doesn't include telegraphing his moves.  He has made this point on many occasions.
t3_7nezpr	0	*	Donald Trump attacks Pakistan claiming 'they have given us nothing but lies and deceit' in return for $33bn aid - ''They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!'. he's right. Yes he is. I will never believe that Pakistan didn't know exactly where Osama bin Laden was the entire time. He was right down the street from a Pakistani military base. Probably the only thing I've agreed with Trump on since he took office a year ago, and I hope he follows through on it. Pakistan makes us look like chumps. Taking our money with one hand then lying to our faces. . I mean that's exactly why the Obama admin chose not to inform Pakistan of the Bin Laden raid beforehand. They did not trust Pakistan not to try to sabotage the mission. They're a sanctuary country for terrorists.. Obama just had an funny interview over in India where the interviewer kept trying to get him to admit that Pakistans excuse for Osama was bullshit lol . Got a link? That sounds interesting.. https://youtu.be/FrdnO0AOk_g. Great find. Very awkward at the end. Why is Obama so afraid to be critical? Seems like he is protecting Pakistan which makes me wonder if Trump now knows something contradictory to Obama's response that there was no evidence of Pakistan knowing anything. Seems like common sense that they had to know which is why I give the interviewer serious props on asking the question.. Because he has enough class to stay out of it and let the next president handle the situation now perhaps?  I'd imagine he is in it for the speaking $ now, not to become a devisive figure
t3_7wjo95	1	*	Israeli fighter jet shot down by Syrian fire. An Iranian UAV entered into Israeli airspace and Israel attacked the location responsible for it, because Syria is an enemy state it's at war with. Syria then fired at the planes because again, the two are at war with each other.    While I understand the concerns about escalation, the comments circlejerk right now with both sides arguing who's at fault is just ridiculous. . Syria and Israel have been in a state of cease fire for years. The countries aren't in an active war with each other. The issue here is the fear of the situation spiraling out of control and the cease fire being cancelled. . > Syria and Israel have been in a state of cease fire for years.  LOL, no they absolutely have not.   The war between Syria and Israel has not ended, it's just not always hot. Cease fire doesn't mean peace. While Syria and Israel are technically at a state of war, they have been at a cease fire since 1974. A cease fire means both sides are agreeing not to conduct actual war on each other. It's very similar to the state between the two Koreas.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Disengagement_between_Israel_and_Syria. Disengagement is a much better term. Israel and Syria have fought heavily since 1974...      . Like when? Do you mean the expeditionary force that Syria sent to Lebanon? In any case, the disengagement came following the ceases fire. . There were entire battles between Israel and Syria during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 82. . And the Israeli annexation of Golan from Syria. Which is still internationally recognized as Syrian. 
t3_7wjo95	0	*	Israeli fighter jet shot down by Syrian fire. uhh ELI5?  what's the relationship of these two prior to this event/why is this a big deal?  yeah how dare I try to learn! fuck me right? keep downvoting xD xD. Syrian supports/allows Iranian presence near the border, which would be the equivalent of Mexico letting Russian troops near the US border.  Israel bombs the part responsible if any fire from the SCW hits Israel. Israel also frequently bombs weapons shipments to terrorist groups in Syria.  Big deal because first time they have hit a jet out of hundreds of raids.   Implication, probably none.. Or like US troops in any number of countries bordering Russia. . Those countries were desperate to join NATO. . And Syria is desperate to be protected by Iran. How is it different?. Iran doesn't have the ability to defend Syria, Syria is just giving them a doorway into Israel, Syria is under no threat of Israeli invasion if they don't attack Israel. I didn't spoke about Israel. Iran is protecting Syria (Syrian government) from rebels and Islamists.. Syrian govt kills its own people with nerve gas. They deserve to be tried for war crimes and killed. Nothing like that goes on in NATO countries.

I agree it's stealing, but shutting of their internet is unnessary imo.. Yeah sure they should get warnings first but if people don't stop then illegal avtivity needs to be stopped. Have you ever driven over the speed limit? If so, should we take your car away?. There are already laws for such things as that which has nothing to do with copyrighted material.. You brought up stopping illegal activity. Who decides which illegal activity is stopped, and which activity is fined?. Government and law officials, just as the judge did in the article. I don't see any problem with these people getting warnings but if they refuse to stop then you can't expect nothing further to happen.. Right, so we get rid of all of the copyright laws currently in use which were put in place thanks to donations and lobbying by the very industries that wanted them put in place.  Then we can start over.

Diplomacy at its finest. . NK will never give up their nukes because they'd have no leverage otherwise. . Honestly disarming clearly isn't going to happen unless by force, they would be better off negotiating peace and reformation of the NK government/practice in order to remove sanctions.  Maybe one day a better government will come and the people won't see the US as an enemy but one that helped them. Then again life ain't a fairytale :/. There have been massive changes in nearly every country on earth over the last 100 years. There's no reason to think that N Korea is forever stuck in amber.. Exactly.

I hope the families of ~~the survivors~~ those lost get answers and find a way to heal. Politics aside, these are still our fellow human beings.  Edit: I mention politics because don't scroll down. . There are literally no politics to put aside. Politics concern a country's government, not their people. I hope swift closure can bring the families of the deceased some comfort.. Yeah Russian people are cool. They love Americans and American culture. Its the regime that has issues with the world. . They have no problem with any country that allows them to launder money with impunity (see: British tax havens). God forbid you try to stop them with sanctions. Then they will fuck you right up your democracy.

So youd take a ride home from the bar with Ted Bundy up until he was convicted in court that is? Up until then hes A-OK, right? . Sure, he only killed women. As a very large man, I would probably be fine. . You know what he meant.. I know. In my opinion there is a difference between not wanting to hang out with probably murder and saying someone may be laundering money. . That is really downplaying the situation if Trump really was part of a Russian money laundering operation considering he is now President.
t3_7p0uw5	0	*	Russia: U.S. only complained about election interference because Trump won. The US isnt complaining. Democrats are. This is because they refuse to understand why Trump won and can only accept that it was some nefarious plot. We wuz robbed !. History wont look kindly on collaborators and traitors to the Republic. . The trick will be defining what this looks like. History is written by the winners.. History is written by historians. . Who are paid by ??. Universities. Really ? Academic Historians study history, they dont write it. If anything the write *about* it. History is generally written by the weight of the media of the time. . University professors of history both research and publish. 
t3_7vdh7d	0	*	German police group calls for decriminalizing cannabis.. Should have happend ages ago. There is no good reason for Cannabis to not be fully legalized when Alcohol, which a much more harmful and dangerous drug, is freely available for purchase everywhere and with thousands of people actively harming themselves every weekend.. because alcohol is already legal, so why legalize another one? /s  they all forget that weed is probably the oldest drug in the world.. But it is not as widely used. Also weed is still harmful. So although it makes some sense to make weed illegal, I would love to see it getting legal. But there should be a high tax on it, as it should be on alcohol. weed is safer than alcohol.   no one ever died from consuming it, the worst that can happen is that you puke and/or fall asleep.   it has way more benefits than your recommended 1 glas of wine per week and can help with a ton of different diseases and other medical conditions.   weed smokers also usually drink way less alcohol.. it still stands, that it is best to not drink alcohol or smoke weed. eating healthier does more for you than not smoking weed occasionally.. even if that were true. Weed is bad for your health.. thats not a true statement.   look up what it can help with.
t3_7vdh7d	1	*	German police group calls for decriminalizing cannabis.. Decriminalise all drug possession and use  Getting high shouldn't be a crime. sure.. let our kids get some crack.. we need more excitement!  unbelievable you even think about this.. . lets hand the entire drugs market to criminals rather than managing it and funding rehabilitation services, it's crazy when you think about it like this. sure.. all criminals will stop to make money with this.. just because its no fun anymore when its legal.. you are crazy when you think about it like this... yes you take the crime element out of it and manage it  ridiculous I know  crazy . Dream on.. it doesnt work with cigarettes.. it wont work with Cannabis . how much more dangerous would cigarette smoking be if the production and sale wasn't licensed and was handled by criminal networks. You miss the point that a lot of people dont buy cigarettes at the store.. they buy illegal imported on the street..  because they are cheaper

I just spent a week in Poland touring various concentration camps and mass graves - hearing about various horror stories of triumph and tragedy   there should be no statute of limitations to the crimes committed by these individuals   they all deserve to be crammed in and rot in jail, just like they had been instructed to do to their prisoners. I don't think it has much to do about a statute of limitations.  The WWII generation is getting fairly old and they are simply dying off.  Chances of catching one of these bad guys decrease daily.. absolutely fair point, but I still believe every effort to bring these individuals to justice before they die should be exhausted, if possible . at this point, why? Spend so many resources just to throw them in jail for a few months before they keel over. They might not even survive long enough for the trial to conclude depending on available evidence.. establish precedent that the world does not care your life, or whatever is left of it, if you committed the sorts of crimes committed by the German Nazi party  I hear where you're coming from, but as long as there is a dollar of disposable government revenue then I think they can spare a couple cents to sentencing the renaming party to face jail time. Maybe they'd rather spend the money on a hospital or something.. disposable  I would imagine necessities like healthcare have already had the funds allotted for. There's never enough government money to do all the things that should be done. You'd be better off supplying some poor kids with free schoolbooks than spending the money to move some 90+ year old from his nursing home to a cell, where frankly the difference probably won't bother them all that much anyway. Have you met many 90+ year olds? They do a lot of sitting.

Every single time you disagree with some person on the left you are called a Nazi, White Supremacist, Sexist, Bigot, Racist, Nazi, Homophobic or Transphobic.

Wouldn't actual nazis have a lot more well used flags and not ones fresh out from the factory? . Or perhaps they revere those flags, and carefully wash and iron them after every march?  Regardless, that is a very weak defence of nazis, fella. You're not really helping your cause.. No flag in the world requires you fold it up into tiny squares. Hence they are brand new, not nearly folded.   What cause is that? My family is Jewish.  . Your cause seems to be dismissing these guys wearing swastikas, otherwise known as neo-Nazis.  Quibbling about how new or well cared for their flags appear to be are weasel words. Seriously, get a fucking grip.. And in saying how hardcore can they be with brand new flags?  Dyed in the wool American veterans have flags decades old.  But I'm supposed to believe these guys are actual hardcore nazis because of a flag?

You can call a cop whatever you want, but if he gets really pissed off then who is to say you are not guilty of [Disturbing the Peace](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/disturbing-the-peace.html)? .

I remember reading a story recently that had quoted some diplomats talking about how Trump had been undoing a lot of their work and they were feeling incredibly frustrated. you could tell they were career guys.. Same with GWB. I know at least a couple who quit because of him. I'm sure many more left under Trump. Note that it isn't the party running things, it is the individual at the top and how they choose to do foreign policy, which is longer term and requires patience.

I dont know of anyone who got sued for it.. ah okay, that makes more sense.   I read it as people get sued for this commonly and are successful.

Most non-whites know that they have to be ultra-careful and interact with police with the consideration that they can/might shoot/arrest them if they don't take care to treat the police the same way you would treat a snarling dog..

That's a gross and ridiculous characterization of the point I am making, and I'm pretty sure you know it.. Not really?

Which is hilarious enough in its own right. You're searching my bag when there's a man nearby with a suspicious haircut?! I demand you profile him!. It is funny that this hairstyle is so popular, given its Nazi history.. The Nazis traded heavily on promoting German cultural norms; if the German people gave up everything that was associated in any way with Nazis, they'd have to give up most of their culture.  Reclaiming culture from the Nazis is important to a lot of the Germans I know.. What about the Hitler stache?. Some things are more strongly associated with Nazis than others, and are more difficult for people to decontextualize.  For example, the Nazis made heavy use of the Eagle; but because (like the hairstyle in question) that wasn't uniquely Nazi, most people don't associate eagles with Nazis. The swastika, on the other hand.... Post-war, Germany removed many eagles. Not all, but they did recognize that it was associated with the Third Reich.   The fact is, if you say someone has a Nazi Youth haircut, people will know what you're talking about. I find it interesting that people are OK with that.

Maybe you're unfamiliar with German history and how seriously certain aspects of it are taken in Germany today?  EDIT:  People bringing up free speech and the First Amendment as arguments need to learn what those cover and do not cover.  Fighting Words are *not* covered by the First Amendment and do not count as part of Free Speech in the US.. I don't give a shit. I care about free speech. I should be able to call German TSA Nazis, even if it isn't close to true.. Please, find a local black cop an start to call him a nigg** and see where u end up with ur free speech . That isn't against the law in the US. You might get arrested on trumped up charges, but guess what?

Is it still incredibly rare, despite even just one case being too many? Also yes.  Regardless, that has absolutely nothing to do with my point. Is insulting an officer in the US legal? Yes.

Drones are not the most effective strategy, but we don't want to actively invade Pakistan.

Free Speech means the government cannot arrest you for criticizing the government.  free speech, the ability to be a raging cunt to anyone you want for any reason, is not a thing that most places have, including America.. It must suck not having rights. Kind of shows how the USA is the best country of all time. You don't have all the rights people enjoy in Germany. It works both ways.. What rights do Germans have that I don't?. Guaranteed holidays, guaranteed healthcare, you can drink from 16, waaay higher consumer protections, etc. While you're jerking yourself off because you can scream tittyballs at a cop, we'll be getting on with our lives, with the things which most affect our lives being taken care of..

t3_7t46a3	1	*	German police sue American woman for slander for calling them 'Nazis'. How is this slander? It was just a heated remark about being over-searched at an airport.  Almost seems slightly authoritarian for a government institution to sue over this. Irony?. Not when you're in a country that has a stack of laws specifically restricting anything to do with Nazism. I shouldn't have to explain why those laws exist there, hopefully. Seems counter intuitive to have those laws if they're going to stifle people's ability to express opinions. If Germany wants to be as anti-Nazi as possible this feels like the wrong way to go about it. . > stifle people's ability to express opinions  Opinions that led to millions dead across Europe. It's a touchy subject. Germany still has Nazi gangs hanging about in the shadows. It's not wrong to say perhaps they should enforce strictly anti-Nazi laws for the time being. Woman shouldn't be shouting a word that leads to dire consequences.. I was referring to the opinion that the state was acting authoritarian and Nazi-like. . Guess what the state is the authority. Authoritarian  having authority. And I never said I agreed with her opinion.. she could have said you act like a nazi. that is an opinion. she said that they are nazis and thereby made it an insult. in germany you have the freedom of opinion but your freedom of speech ends when you take away people's dignity by insulting and defamation

Silly woman is just showing her own ignorance of what the word actually implies, especially in Germany. Airport police do not harass you just because they can, they have a job to do.  She deserves everything she gets.. Hey German Redditor, Reading the article, it mentions a slander paragraph in German law and an example of someone yelling derogatory insults in traffic, i.e. road rage. Does that mean I'm breaking the law in Germany when I flip someone off for tailgating or cutting me of??. Yes you can get sued for that in Germany. . That's hilarious, what a weird country. Well, that coming from someone from a country where you could sue a company because coffee is too hot or I didn't know I couldn't dry my cat in the microwave is a bit biased.. People always mention the McDonalds coffee without understanding that it was a legitimate issue. They had been warned multiple times to stop serving it at a temperature that was unsafe and not even able to be consumed. . I guess, serving a typical hot drink in a real hot condition is not something considered a legitimate issue by most people all over the world. Even if some local laws exist regarding this, it will be still considered silly by most folks.. It might have something to do with all the third degree burns and shit that she got.

He got really drunk and took a snapchat video of him calling the German police fucking facists. His next snapchat was a picture of the citation they gave him for it. Those guys guys don't fuck around with that shit.. Yup, its illegal to insult people in public in Germany, especially a bad idea to do so to the police while recording it (recording/photo people without consent is also another potential crime depending on the situation... as Germans value privacy a lot).. Until you REALLY overdo it, you won't get arrested though. German police is pretty relaxed most of the times.. German police have managed to make sure my wasted ass found the right train home multiple times. You really need to try and piss them off before they cite/arrest you. . Can... can... can we get some of them in America pls?  In our country you can be on the floor submissively begging for your life and crying and you'll STILL end up dead, never having done ANYTHING.. Their training is longer than a goddamn bachelor degree, aint nobody looking for a quick powertrip got time for that.. German police officers must have a University degree, they alsmo make about 100k a year.   >they alsmo make about 100k a year  Yeah, that's absolutely not true.  A police officer in Germany with about 9 years experience earns on average just under 50K Euro per year. No where near 100k.

Most other societies did use the year since so and so was in charge method.. > Rome was the one that put an end to it with the Julian calendar.  This is incorrect. The Julian calendar changed how each year was recorded, but not the number of the year.

t3_7rqrzk	0	*	Suicides in Japan decline for 8th-straight year amid a stronger economy and improvements in counseling programs. Also the pop is going down so the suicidal people are probably all dying off. Population has declined by less than one percent, but suicides are down by about 26 percent in the same 8 year period.  I really doubt that this trend is influenced strongly by population decline.     As a sidenote - the birth rate has been up overall since 2005.  I think the population issues are very serious - but the numbers just aren't what most of us would imagine.. Other commentators and google are saying that the birth rate is 1.46 as of 2015. That is still incredibly low, especially without immigration.. It's not incredibly low. It's the same as Germany and close to Canada and US.  Edit: my point isn't that it's fine... Immigration plus *modern society birth rate* is how most countries do it.  My point is that Japan's birth rate is reflective of almost every modern society's birth rate, which is under replacement rates.. Wait, why does that prove it isn't incredibly low?. My point is that Japan's birth rate is reflective of almost every modern society's birth rate, which is under replacement rates.. But Japan refuses to take in immigrants like other major countries, so their situation is quite different from the US and Germany. . Japan also has the longest lifespan of any country on the planet, among the lowest crime rates, and almost no violent crime.  Weird.
t3_7oqln0	1	*	Thirty-two people are missing after an oil tanker carrying 136,000 tonnes of Iranian oil worth $60m, and a cargo ship collided off China's east coast. The 21 cargo crew have been rescued. It is the first major accident involving an Iranian oil tanker since global sanctions were lifted January 2016.. As a tanker officer myself I find it surprising that the tanker caught on fire. It was constructed in 2008 meaning it has double hull which should prevent perforation of the cargo tank, additionally the tanks should have been inerted so that there is no explosive mix in the tanks, more than one thing went wrong here for sure.. Could it be sabotage?  Interesting timing with the protests happening concurrently. . Isn't there also lots of illegal oil sales happening via ships? Weird every single crewmember of the freighter is fine and zero of the tanker. . The tanker was the one with flammable cargo, if it exploded they were most likely trapped in the accommodation by the heat/fire . I understand the logistics of an oil tanker but when the lowly deckhand is separated by feet of steel from the officers its hard to imagine not a single survivor vs the Chinese ships not a single death . Difficult to give an exact answer, usually i would expect at least couple of survivors. But tanker fires (when they happen) tend to be quite violent so the entire crew perishing is not hard to imagine. Thank you for your wisdom and insight here wolf, we really appreciate it.. No prob
t3_7za8v1	1	*	Trump endorses guns for teachers to stop shootings. Of course, the best way to stop school shootings from occurring is to put the guns in the school. It's obvious. That is like saying the best way to stop war is to take away the soldiers guns. If those teachers were armed lives would have been saved, simple as that. Tho a better idea is not to force teachers to have guns but simply to allow teachers who are qualified to carry them if they want. Now THAT is a common sense gun law.. It's more like saying the way to stop a fire is to dump gasoline on it so it burns out faster.. That analogy is closer to let's give the students guns. Allowing teachers to carry is a fire line. Precise and effective. They may not be able to stop the first couple of deaths but it won't become a massacre. And people will know that schools are protected.. http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=1787604&itype=CMSID. Congrats, you found an accident within 300 Million people clap Let's take this example and blow it out of proportion for your arguments sake.. Only 2 states allowed it then, I don't believe teachers in Utah and Nebraska added to 300M people.  Probably less than 100 teachers with guns it took for one to blow a toilet out from under her ass.  For your hyperbole to be true, to be 1 of a subgroup of 300M, every adult in America needs to be a teacher with a gun.. I don't know many gun owners who would willingly do those kind of studies. FYI a lot of gun owners carry guns in regardless of the rules because they know better and they know how to properly conceal their firearms.

Yeah sorry...not for *our journalists.* They can either have our President visit *and accommodate all our journalists* or no President. America first!  /?. Maybe journalists should stop trying to change the world and actually report on what has transpired in our society. SJW's can go fuck themselves if they want to ruin the free press by making the story about themselves rather that the actual happening..

If we were to look at American history, I think it's quite clear that the act of a punch is tame.. What's outrageous is the environment where a kid can openly punch a soldier and the soldier can't even hold her down and just has to take it. She knew she would have totally gotten away with it which is why she kept hitting him and even told her friend who was filming it to come closer--except this time, the film backfired for her. That's quite different than your evil occupying soldier narrative.. So stealing and occupying of land and racial oppression vs a punch in the face.   Whos the villain here.. hmmm.

Without their support Gaddafi might have been able to put down the revolt, or at least hold on to part of the country like the Syrian dude.. Yes, and why would that have been a good thing in your opinion?. There would be no slave markets in Libya.  The black Libyans of Tawergha wouldn't have faced ethnic cleansing and genocide.  Islamists wouldn't have political representation in the country.  ez.. Also Libya's anarchy probably makes it easier for terrorists to move into neighboring African countries and get heavy weapons from Libya.

t3_7zq953	0	*	FBI investigating whether Russian money went to NRAs campaign to help elect Donald Trump. Jesus christ this is getting out of hand. Does anyone actually believe the NRA needs Russian money?. The FBI does I suppose.. Can you quote me in this article where it says the FBI is investigating whether Russian money went to the NRA to fund Trump's campaign?  Cause I can't seem to find it.. You can't read the first paragraph?  Activists are demanding thexa0National Rifle Associationxa0(NRA) reveal if it received donations fromxa0Russia, after it was reported the FBI is investigating whether axa0Kremlin-linked Moscowxa0businessman channelled money to the groups campaign to helpxa0Donald Trumpxa0win the election.. That isn't the FBI saying it. It's an anonymous leak from earlier reporting.. An anonymous leak from the FBI, the people investigating him. Are you saying you don't believe Torshin is being investigated?. Given that it is a felony to leak this? Why would you risk jail time?  I'm saying I don't know if they are or not. But given the fact that there have been several leaks from Mueller's team that haven't panned out I'm going with he runs a pretty tight ship and this is probably BS.. It was a leak from the FBI, not Mueller's team, and the reasoning could be lots of things. You're not really presenting any argument against but your opinion on the subject. The FBI is investigating that Russian oligarch, not Mueller as far as anyone knows. You're conflating two separate things.

The voters are just pawns in political games. . I've suspected for a while that Russian funding might have had a hand in this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnIVVWtAag&t=1s.

I wonder what they're actually doing while America is stunned.. As far as I can tell, they're building up support in the Middle East, solidifying power in Eastern Europe, and trying to destabilize the the EU..

The moment they cut off the internet Yeah but didn't the US bomb hanoi  The moment Russia invades us Yeah but didn't we kill all those vietnamese. that's a horrible comparison... what would you expect the US government to do if another country stationed shit like we have on our northern and southern borders then surrounded the rest with subs?  i'd expect them to prepare a response. plus how are they gonna get all that fake news to us if they destroy our internet infrastructure

t3_7zq953	1	*	FBI investigating whether Russian money went to NRAs campaign to help elect Donald Trump. Investigate all the dark Pac money while you're at it. Campaign finance laws are a joke and all these fuckers are accepting money from everywhere. Russia isn't the only country funneling money into our elections. I don't think oligarchs care about borders.. Exactly. Repeal Citizens United and start looking how the money flows. I bet that they'll catch a whole lot more of these scams going on.. You will have to wait until 2/3rds of the supreme Court dies.  So maybe in 30 years or so . 2/3rds? It would take 1 vote to flip the SCOTUS on campaign finance. . Getting them to revisit a case like that is petty unlikely, you don't technically need more that 5 but on a practical note even the sitting liberal justices are unlikely to try and manipulate the court that way.. Yeah, the ruling is way too new for them to revisit it. It was a terrible and highly destructive ruling, but it's going to be awhile before anything changes, especially since an Amendment to the Constitution it's basically impossible with our current political climate. We just need to hope that Trump doesn't get to replace anymore Justices with young extreme far-Right Republicans like Gorsuch.. You do realize that citizens united was bipartisan. You do realize that gay marriage was bipartisan on the court as well?   How is Gorsuch far right? . He's *very* libertarian which is pretty far right. Not to be confused with the alt-right.

Interesting how the NRA has been treated lately as some lovely organization being unfairly lambasted by liberal media lately on Reddit. Mostly seeing this on r/news, while they completely ignore their shady ties and contributions to corruption in our government.. >Mostly seeing this on r/news  Found your problem. R/news comments are a cesspool.. r/news is a cesspool, but increasingly so is r/worldnews. It sucks watching the donaldites and Kremlin stooges inundating threads constantly, or artificially voting up narrative news [e.g. anti-migrant, anti-left] and astro-turfing/gaslighting the comments. They still are scared of r/politics but I'm sure they are planning. . When they're trying to manipulate r/politics, they just pretend to be Bernie supporters.. Or the famous catch phrase ... I'm no Trump supporter but.... To be fair, /r/politics is a cesspool.

France has equal if not better nuclear deterrence that is entirely French designed and operated, and Turkey has a massive conventional army. The UK is a regional power at best.. Having nukes and a large army aren't what make a superpower. It's force projection, which the UK excels in. It's one of the only countries in the world with capabilities of deploying almost anywhere at anytime.. UK excels in force projection? What universe is this?. Same universe but like 150 years ago.

They are individuals.. Well typically, many of them do so because they are concerned about their legacy.  Carnige and Rockefeller are prime examples,  Certainly glad that Gates is doing so though, he didn't have much of a good image during the 1990s.  Jobs seems to have been a much bigger dick before the cult of iApple turned up in the 2000s.. But those billionaires you mentioned are also remembered as some of the greatest philanthropists in the history of the U.S. I think it kinda evens out.  In trying to seem like theyre a good person they become one, essentially.. Don't you get it though. If you have resoucres that you don't just freely give away to governments or strangers you're a bad person. /s. The best lesson from Forest Gump. Once you have more then enough money you SHOULD help your community.   Should be a basic human value.   Nigeria is not Bill Gates Community so no credit.

t3_7y2b8w	0	*	Facebook has been told by a Belgium court to delete all the data it had gathered on Belgians who did not use Facebook by placing tracking code - known as cookies - on third-party websites. This applies only in Belgium.  So in other countries Facebook can track you even if you don't have a Facebook account. . Facebook can still track people in Belgium as well. There are much better ways to track people these days than cookies.. Example?. Checking your browser fingerprint or viewing a page with the facebook like button on it would be two simple ways to accomplish it without a cookie. There are a ton more. If they want to make a difference they need to ban tracking itself not one specific way to track people.. Would using no-script help? It blocks scripts run by facebook, so even if the site has a facebook button, their script wouldn't run on my browser.. Kinda. I can still just load a 1 pixel image and grab information about your browser such as your useragent, ip address and whatever else is sent in the headers, if you have a big enough dataset you can still target advertisements to people.. Funnily enough, that method is actually patented.  A marketing firm I used to develop software for got smacked by a patent troll because we were using it to track how often people visited pages and if they read our emails.. Hey use a jpeg next ;)    In all seriousness that's ridiculous, what happened next? Did you guys stop or try to fight it?
t3_7y2b8w	1	*	Facebook has been told by a Belgium court to delete all the data it had gathered on Belgians who did not use Facebook by placing tracking code - known as cookies - on third-party websites. I suppose this is a good start, but law needs to catch up fast. These sites can track and profile you just as reliably, if not more so, without cookies. They're all hung up on the cookie itself when the issue should be the actual tracking regardless of what method they use. Banning a specific method like tracking cookies does nothing to stop tracking.. The law has caught up, just look at the GDPR. (the new data protection law in the EU executed from May onwards)  The law isnt perfect but it changes many of the current practices. What will need to catch up however, is the courts. It will take some years until the first big cases have gone through to the EU courts :(. As an individual, GDPR-like regulations are great.  As a consultant responsible for getting companies GDPR compliant, it fucking sucks. Big ol donkey balls.. Why does it suck as a consultant? The GDPR opened up another job market for you. . I don't usually do audits. Compliance and auditing is the most boring work ever, but there's so much money in it.. Who's going to pay for auditing all of these tech companies? Is there an expectation that they'll get their fines no matter what from FB/Goog/MS/etc?. The companies are. And in turn, the consumers will. GDPR compliance isn't a one time thing, it involves changing entire business practices and new positions and responsibilities for tracking data. As great an idea as it is, this will probably increase the prices of services that must keep personal data somewhat.. >The companies are. And in turn, the consumers will  No that's not how it works. That's not how anything works.  Market prices do not magically jump due to a company's increased business process expenditures. That's ridiculous.  They may jump, *may*.

There are other reasons for foreign aid. We pay countries (particularly Egypt and Israel) not to go to war with each other. We're less worried they'll go to war with us.. Stop paying both and just let Israel beat Egypt if Egypt attacks them as they have in every war.
t3_7rimau	1	*	A Norwegian plane went from New York to London in 5 hours 13 minutes  the fastest subsonic commercial transatlantic flight ever. Here's an interesting video on why flying from the US to europe is faster and why they all pretty much take the same path: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aQ2E0mlRQI  Edit: He also talks about the previous record of 5h 16m on Jan 8, 2015. And like a previous commenter mentions, it's all about wind.. It has to do with the Jet Stream I'm assuming? (At work). Yeah, on Jan 8 there were record 200+ mph winds.. With no knowledge of this topic, could a plane go too fast?. Planes have a top speed relative to the air around them, if they go faster, the pressure on the wings gets too high and structural damage happens.    But in a theoretical wind stream with no turbulence, the plane can't get too fast as long as its relative speed to the moving air around it isn't too high.. Einstein said something about this. most things are, like, relative, y'know? . And that boy's name was Albert Einstein.
t3_7seh76	0	*	Trump solar tariff will cause disruption, says UN renewable chief. Serious question. Could the UN sanction the USA for speeding up the effects of climate change? The data is there to show we  put out more carbon and do less to reverse that, than almost every industrialized nation. I mean, besides nuclear war and disease this has to be the single largest threat to humanity.  Am I wrong?. No... because the us leads the world in amount of carbon cut... and trump wont stop that. Because solar panels have nothing to do with it. Its because of us switching from coal to natural gas. So actually we should sue the world for not keeping up with us. Be the change you wish to see. Will you take that great big jump to sue the world?. no.. you were the one who wants the US to be sanctioned for leading the world... crazy. The US is leading the world? In what regards? To higher tides, longer droughts, and more extreme weather events?

t3_7otw9v	1	*	Suicide at Chinese iPhone factory reignites concern over working conditions. The Foxconn factory in Shenzen employs about 300,000 workers. All deaths are tragic, but it's worth noting that this is a lower suicide rate than, say, students at Cornell University.. I go to Cornell University. We have 13,000 undergrads and had two suicides in the past year. Math checks out :(. MIT has about ten thousand students and about a suicide a year on average. . I dont know about the statistic, but my friend at MIT told me that during our freshman year, a guy in her cohort killed himself literally two weeks after the start of the semester. Really tragic. :(. I remember a year when we had multiple suicides. But the average, over something like several decades, was about one per year. MIT has a lot of help available, but is also an extremely high pressure environment. . I went to University of Alberta in Canada and there were 3 official suicides during my degree. But we all knew that whenever you saw all three emergency services vehicles on campus it was another engineering student suicide.  Our mental health counseling system was a complete cluster fuck unsurprisingly. . All three emergency services? I get police and ambulance but why fire?. No idea. But all 3 came for suicides

Capitalism literally requires infinite growth. By definition it is unsustainable.. How does capitalism require infinite growth? Capitalism is a system build on trading, it can even function if their is shrinking. Of course thats not pleasant but its posable.. >Capitalism is a system build on trading  Regardless of your opinions on capitalism, that definition is just wrong.. Trading includes the exchange of currency for goods. Capitalism is most certainly built on trade. . I think it's built more on the profit motive than it's built on trade. I don't think socialists and anarchists object to trading, but they do reject private property and wage labor which is more fundamental to capitalism.

Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system and competitive markets.

Yes, it's a tragic only because it somehow fits the they stole our jobs and slave labor narrative.. > they stole our jobs and slave labor narrative  You think the latter is just a narrative and not a serious issue...?. Slave labor probably exists in China, especially in the poorer part of the country.

No the person would filter it out like that one dude that says I'm only going to smoke cigarettes for a year  10 years later they're still quitting.. Is that... is that a real person you have met? Like they were casually gonna try cigarette for a entire year to like... demo it?. Sounds dumb but 12 year old me wanted to know why people thought they were addictive. Stole one from my mum, tried it, hated it but then when friends talked about smoking I boasted how I always smoke and will show them how to.  One of them asked me aren't you supposed to inhale? And that's where I learnt how dumb I was. It was also this time that I got hooked.  . First time I tried was when I was on a cruise. A hot girl gave me a cigarette and I accidentally used the wrong side of it. So embarrassing.. First step to getting over embarrassments is to learn to laugh at yourself while realizing we are all human and make mistakes. I don't know why i typed this. . And later, the first time someone gave me a mechanical cigarette, I thought it was a mechanical pencil.

t3_7rch4x	1	*	Cape Town water supply near 'point of no return' as reservoirs run dry. Water will become the new oil. Canada and the Middle & Eastern US are fortunate in that regard.. Columbia river flows into the states. If Canada dams it, bombers will assemble. . There is already a treaty about the Columbia that predates NAFTA. There's no way we'd stop the US from getting water out of it regardless, and no reason to. It represents such a small percent of the flowing water in Canada.  But we already do dam it. Just we don't stop the flow. There's maybe 15 dams already.. Exactly, not damming it for all that sweet sweet hydroelectric power would just be foolish.. Wind and Solar are preferrable over hydroelectric, if viable. But hydro is still better than fossil fuels or (arguably) nuclear.. Hydroelectric is solar power,just concentrated.. Technically so is oil...

They make enough money that the investment was worth it. The debt still follows them and can cripple them, I mean partly because they typically will buy a house or buy high rent also, but yea it can be very difficult..

They were so desperate for change they elected the most corrupt president of all time? Really? Should we really cater to people so fucking stupid?. They saw Hillary, someone who had been in politics before, and Trump, someone who hadn't. It's easy to see why they supported him. Dismissing them as stupid is just going to lead to a repeat.. Exactly. Thank you. They were completely wrong about Trump, sure, but that doesn't change their reasoning. And it doesn't mean they won't be tempted to vote for the next rich guy promising them a taste of something better than living paycheck to paycheck--especially if the Democrats can't do better than another political dynasty, like the Kennedys, touting incremental improvements.. So... you're saying they aren't stupid. But they did vote for an obviously lying rich narcissist over someone offering incremental improvements? B just sounds like a long winded way of saying A.. I'm not saying no stupid people voted for him. I'm saying a lot of those who voted for him were desperate, and desperate people aren't always logical. If a bunch of people living paycheck to paycheck see option A promising them more of the same while option B guarantees them greener pastures, it's not surprising some of the those people are gonna convince themselves it's worth a shot.

Can we just start forcing people to get hypocrite tattooed on their foreheads for stuff like this?   Just, as a warning to others.. Or maybe make hypocrisy in politics a sackable offence. . can you think of a potential downside to that?. 80% of current members thrown out of office. Nope, not seeing a downside so far.. Who do you think gets to determine what is hypocrisy?. The electorate?. They're not really doing what I'd call a bang-up job at the moment.. I thought the postal vote on marriage equality showed that the electorate can do a 'bang-up job' as you call it.
t3_7w01y1	1	*	Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce -- who strongly opposed gay marriage, arguing it was against traditional family values -- is expecting a baby with his former staff member, after leaving his wife of 24 years. TLDR: Conservative Aussie who hated what people did in their private lives feels violated by people judging him for what he does in his private life. . That was exactly my thought when i saw the grab of ScoMo saying it was private and none of the public or government's business. Buuuuuuuuut what two men or women did in the privacy of their bedrooms was the subject of government debate and a public vote. My eyes almost rolled into the back of my head at the hypocrisy.  . Same. Add to that his comments against making Gardisil available (apparently it would make people more promiscuous) and his attitude to people calling out his hypocrisy is laughable. . Holy fuck i was about to have a laugh about that and then saw Gardisil is a cervical cancer vaccine that Barneby opposed it on the basis of 'his daughters may become promiscuous'. What a piece of shit. Did you also see his comments about the best protection for his daughters being a husband? I could have sworn he was quoting Jane Austen for that one. IMO, that kind of attitude can stay back in the Regency era. . I didnt but im not suprised. I hope his daughters put him in a home at 65 for this shit.. Rumor has it that his daughter campaigned against him, off the back of a ute with a loudspeaker, during the by-election.. Rumour has it that she grabbed the campaign truck and drove around Armadale with a loudspeaker, letting everyone know she did not like her dad's new wife policy.

Extramarital affairs are actually very traditional. That's not to say they are OK, or not - only that the tradition is very long. . I really dont care if politicians have affairs, but starting a relationship with your staffer is kind of fucked up. . Do we know who really started the relationship?. Both of them and it was more fucked up of him because he was the one who was married as well as being the superior. . She is 33.  So its not like she's some vulnerable girl straight out of university whose been starry eyed over a more powerful man.  And she no longer works for him.  I mean, they are living together now.. No, but if I start a relationship with someone who works for me, it's considered inappropriate at minimum.. I guess.  I'd say they are equally to blame.  She knew he was married, she probably even knew his wife.  . She is a cunt but has little blame when compared to the guy. The guy is a real scum bag for destroying his family.

There aren't any problems for most West Bank Palestinians to go to Jordan or to access the Allenby Bridge.

t3_7v4bzl	1	*	Yorkshire coal plant to close at the end of September due to no longer being economically viable. After it shuts, there will be just six coal plants left in the UK.. As good as it is to shut them down, there needs to he something to replace the jobs. If you take away the jobs, you are just asking for all kinds of problems.. The self-coined worlds biggest wind farm is to be built somewhat nearby in Hull, creating 2000 jobs.  Of course, Hull and the East Coast desperately need those jobs too...  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-35483190. Does that actually create that many long-term jobs, or is it the standard scam claim of the people building the wind-farm is going to create 2000 jobs for a short-period then once it's all built there's only a small percentage of jobs that stick around?. Increases in the supply chain work force is definitely used to present an optimistic view of job numbers but it shouldn't be discounted. It could be that a wind farm keeps a cable factory busy for 6 months or a steel yard for 12. The kinds of number of staff that'll permanently work on an offshore wind farm is 30-50.. And they're going to set up a cable factory and steel yard in Hull for the project?. No, but those people at the factory that already exists somewhere wont lose their jobs due to lack of demand for product.  The 130 jobs this plant loses,  wouldnt compare to the 1000s of jobs lost at a factory.. But that's not creating a new job, which is what the original claim was.  That's supporting an existing one.. The new jobs would be 30-50 technicians, supervisor, vessel skipper and support staff. I don't know of any new steel yards or cable factories to be built round Hull but I do know that Siemens are working on a sizable blade factory round that way.

t3_7w8pn9	1	*	Japan has given a stark warning to Britain that its big companies -- and others -- would have to quit the country if trade barriers after Brexit wipe out their profit margins.. Something tells me British car makers don't care. . British car makers are too worried about their supply chains being fucked, and the impoverishment of the UK population who will no longer be able to afford their cars, and the potential tariff barriers and quotas that will prevent them selling to other markets.. Looks like it might end up more economical to build their parts in the UK. . We do not have the manufacturing capabilities to produce these parts.  Modern businesses rely on international supply chains to create the cheapest product at the best price.  If we are forced to produce these parts ourselves the cost goes up and the customer pays more.  In addition to this, the British companies are now the more expensive option for the EU so people lose their jobs.. That's true to an extent, except the cost of shipping is very high, which makes it economical to build in the UK. With more business in the UK even if the customer is paying, the wealthier the UK companies are, which allows them to expand and build their cars in Germany for sale in Germany. . But then no Germans would buy the car as the car would be more expensive than German cars that are made with international supply chains. Cars made in German by British companies are still built using the existing supply lines. . But we haven't exited the EU yet, so the calamitous effect of that still has to be factored it.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki wasn't a genocide?. Technically no?.

This is the literal definition of genocide.  The bombings, while horrendous, do not enter that definition.. Yes they do. The intention behind the bombs was to kill as many Japanese as possible. That was the point. That fits your description flawlessly.  The first bomb you can argue in favour of, sure. But the second one? The Japanese wanted to surrender. An American general was quoted afterwards saying the first bomb was to end the war, the second was for Pearl Harbor.. If you want to use a big buzzword, the word you're looking for is terrorism.

I do like local beer, the problem is that it is expensive. Sadly (again) the local Microbreweries production is aimed to a specific sector of population: hipsters and middle upper class white collar workers (aka Godinez in Mexico). So you have to visit overpriced places to get local beer, which means that for any given party or social reunion, the best option is still buying beers from big brands..

Getting old also helps I'm sure. 3 beers a night is in itself alcoholism level, or potentially. 6+ is straight-up alcoholism. . There are different levels of alcoholism. That's like barely an alcoholic. Well alcoholism is a disease and some may not be as prone to it for whatever reason so it's hard to assume even heavy drinkers are alcoholics.

It's like the absolute worst way the planet could go.  I don't think people really get how bad it would be.  How is it all of a sudden cold war fears all over again?. They built it to uphold the principals of MAD. With the increased amount of missile defense systems in the USA's sphere of influence, the ability for a retaliatory strike from Russia is diminished.. Russia still has the same problem the Soviet Union had regarding access to the ocean. Their subs must travel through narrow straits to reach the open sea. The US has plenty of capacity to track each Russian sub and destroy them in case of war.  The US has two long coastlines on two different oceans, so their subs have no problem in reaching open sea undetected.  . Submarines are still extremely hard to track. Several country's including Russia have developed nearly silent propulsion. Pretty much just like the caterpillar drive in the hunt for the red October. Think a submarine without noisy screws.      . >Pretty much just like the caterpillar drive in the hunt for the red October.  Which would trip nearly every magnetic detector within several hundred kilometers.. Your comment made so much sense that it immediately ruined that movie for me. Thanks,  I guess.

It's like the absolute worst way the planet could go.  I don't think people really get how bad it would be.  How is it all of a sudden cold war fears all over again?. Remember when that guy saved the planet twice by not pushing the button because he had a gut feeling that something wasn't quite right? Now imagine that guy is replaced by an automated drone with no gut feelings.. >because he had a gut feeling that something wasn't quite right?  That's what he told everyone after the fact, sure. But think about it, if you were in his place and saw hundreds of nuclear missiles incoming, you and everyone you know as good as dead, wouldn't the only moral choice be to NOT retaliate? To give humanity as a whole at least SOME chance of survival?. It wasn't hundreds, it was only a few. But the fact of the matter is that he had standing orders to retaliate if he saw incoming missiles. He saw them. His gut said it didn't feel right. Didn't fire the missiles. Avoided catastrophe. You put an algorithm in place of that (which an unmanned drone would have) and you don't get that. The drone would see incoming missiles and fire.. Depends on the algorithm. These days, some might make a more accurate assessment than humans would.. Depends on the input. The input was faulty. Human had a gut feeling. Algorithms don't have those. Yeah, well, if that's your only input, you don't have a very robust classifier. If it takes into account other features in its assessment, it might classify the official signals as anomalous.. The gut feeling could be attributed to things like recent political events and news and it would be really hard to teach a computer to take all of that accurately into account when figuring out whether or not it's an actual strike or a false alarm.

I'm trying to find more sources on it but it's pretty hard. I think the idea is it's a *massive* dirty bomb due to the cobalt.

Not true at all. Most anti ship missiles have a range that makes them ineffective vs a carrier group.  The only you linked is less than 100 miles. And it has to get through the most advanced anti missile defences on the planet. . Nothing America has can take out a Sunburn.  (Maybe the lasers can, but they're not deployed yet, are they?)  But your point just proves that Sunburn is a *defensive* weapon, not an offensive one ... how do you know that?. It's pretty well established that if the US had the capability of taking out a Sunburn, it wouldn't be so upset that Russia, China .. and Iran .. have them. . Sunburns have shit range and can be targeted by shipborn awacs. Don't kid yourself.. You need to catch up on what Janes' thinks about this subject.

t3_7qrqkm	0	*	North Korea Calls Trump Nuclear Button Tweet the 'Spasm of a Lunatic'. Meanwhile people die in concentration camps and starve to death in North Korea...people risking their lives and the lives of their families just to escape the North.. People die in for-profit prisons in America and starve to death homeless on the street after losing their money paying for a medical emergency, or are shot by the government police force for doing nothing wrong.  Im not saying one isnt worse than the other, but America is anything but heaven.. Comparing North Korean prison camps to American prisons is ludicrous. DPRK's prison system is worse than the Soviet GULAGs which saw about 2,000,000 die. The North Korean camps have seen 400,000 die in a country with 1/10th the population.  Reevaluate your whataboutisms.. I mean, you have to hold the USA at a higher standard than North Korea. We do. If you don't believe we do, you're wrong.  North Korea has roughly the population of Texas. In Texas prisons, there are approximately 691.3 deaths per year - this includes natural causes. To reach 400,000 deaths (the North Korean number often cited), Texas prisons would have to operate for 578.6 years. North Korea has been a country for no more than 68. . Since 2001 (up to end 2014), 100,000 people have died in American prisons. 1000 people in addition die every year from police shootings.. Yeah and 2.5 million Americans die per year which is about 10% of the population of the DPRK, whats your point?. That saying 400,000 people have died in North Korean concentration camps is perhaps spurious at best, and doesnt tell us much.

They've been on his ass since he announced his run and ratchet ed it up when he went against their god, Shrillary. Prior to the election, the media had a mostly favorable portrayal of Trump for 30 fucking years. Guess you are not old enough to know, so no biggie. . Excellent example of why I usually refrain from discussing politics online, and if i engage, I stick to fact-based discussions. Take the childishness and extremism somewhere else please.. >I stick to fact-based discussions  >Take the childishness and extremism somewhere else please  Boy you're really doing a great job with those fact based discussions. Just so you know, ad hominem and facts aren't the same thing.. Sorry, using terms like Shrillary and insinuating I'm not old enough to know what I'm talking about when you don't even know my age shows one is on an extreme end of the political spectrum and childish.

Your link shows his approval rating has continuously fallen. . It's at 45%. And has consistently been around the mid-40s for months. Obama was right around that percentage at this point in his presidency. They even ended their first years as president at the same approval rating of 46%. If anything, Trump has gained more support than people think.. He started around 60% and is now around 40%. Hes lost support. Thats what that says. .

When we sit in the echo chamber agreeing with each other, we're a circlejerk.. Has he done anything worth a pro-trump article yet? There's some cause and effect to pay attention to here.. If you get all your news from Reddit, the answer is no.. Trump has many subreddits that promote his ideology, exclusively.. Sorry.

A lot of people hate Trump because there are a lot of reasons to hate him. It's no a bandwagon, it's a popular opinion backed by sound reasoning.. I would love to have an actual honest conversation with a group of The_Donald. I feel like they aren't interested in an actual exchange of ideas.   Edit: Typo. Seems to be the case. They just pretend there's no actual, good reason to hate this man. When obviously there is.. I really dont get it. I dont see how anyone with a sound mind, body, and soul could happily support this man and this administration. It baffles me. Sometimes it doesnt even feel like real life.   I cant even look at family members the same. How can you respect and support a person who obviously has zero respect for ANYONE. IT IS FUCKING BONKERS. . What really confuses me, too, is how they don't mind that he disrespects them. Says he loves the poorly-educated, says they'd support him even if he killed someone. Don't they have any self-respect?.

Very poor attitude and I feel sorry if this is a real mindset. . Haiti and Africa represent poor, and uncivilized countries, Norway represents wealthy, and western civilized....  I think you'd find 99% of Americans would rather visit Norway, than would visit Haiti or Somalia.  Why does it always have to turn to race?. We were once a shithole? What makes us better than them? Shouldn't mankind help those who can be helped?  Dick.... How were we once a shithole?. Do all americans thinks life and society has always been like this? 100 years ago toilet plumbing wasnt a big thing. Most sheeple think in such short term. Think before your life, think after it, i know youre probably saying that doesnt concern me. And that the fucking peoblem .  . Plumbing wasn't a big thing in 1918?!  Fuck sakes.  . There's a difference between pipes and quality systems nation wide. In the 30s 100+ people died of dysentery due to faulty plumbing at the world fair in chicago.. kinda like in 3rd world countries.

For all intents and purposes, they are now a major multinational with nothing but shareholders in mind. I don't inherently disagree with that, but I wish they wouldn't push how Canadian they are and prey on people buying into that.. Theres nothing Canadian about stale bread and shitty coffee. But there are some dudes at a rink! Think of the dudes!. I'm not that familiar with Tim Hortons.. is this referencing a commercial or something?. Tim Horton was a professional hockey player..

t3_7q0zlf	0	*	Switzerland bans boiling lobsters alive. Live crustaceans, including the lobster, may no longer be transported on ice or in ice water. Aquatic species must always be kept in their natural environment,. They should kill them with liquid nitrogen before cooking?. The correct method is to make a cut between the front to the back of the head.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W37TDK6dBM  It doesn't need to be a hassle, but is respecting what you're catching, killing and eating.. this doesnt kill the lobster immediately as it has a decentralized nervous system.. This should be upvoted IMO.  All of the comments purporting to define the most 'humane' way to kill a lobster are anthropomorphized pseudo science  . No, it's using science to do the best we can. Electrocution seems more humane than boiling.  Anthropomorphism would be a lobster worried about college admissions.. Who the hell cares about Lobsters feelings? wtf. We're gonna literally rip its skin open and eat its meat with a fork.  Also, humane? A lobster? Is this some kind of social experiment or what? . In many cultures, meat cannot be eaten unless it was humanly killed. The best example of this is Kosher foods. Instead of just slitting an animals throat and leaving them to die a slow painful death, there are humanitarian methods to cause the quickest death possible, this also leaves the meat tasting better as well.

Im in agreement with your statement and I pose this serious question.  If we have to respect what we catch, handle, kill, and eat.   Should we also respect how we catch them?  Naturally, progress happens in steps so it won't happen at once. Just curious your thoughts. . The best way to do this, imo, in a largely capitalistic society is to vote with your wallet. Small differences, like purchasing skipjack that was pole and line caught, versus long line or sein, can make a big difference. . Ahem... Such voting powers in a capitalistic society are far from being, like, of equal magnitude.. Agreed. You need a large grouping of people to make a substantial difference. If that's your aim, then it's going to be tough when commerce and low income supports government subsidized practices. It's more expensive to live sustainably. . Depends actually whether you've freed yourself from the money system, then it's no longer expensive, even if it requires efforts.

Try telling them that if we should start assaulting Fascists, we need to go against Socialists and Communists as well. The doublethink really comes out.. >we need to go against Socialists and Communists as well.   No, why would we?  >The doublethink really comes out.  Nazis are objectively evil. Right wing extremist socialists and communists, too.  Left wing socialists and communists are not.. I would say that the Communist/Socialist ideology is just as evil, the only difference being that they discriminate at least in the beginning according to a different set of principles so they appear less evil.. >I would say that the Communist/Socialist ideology is just as evil  All right wing ideology is evil.

You're talking as if we lived in an abstract world where non violence is the norm, but you'd be wrong, global capitalism is founded and run on violence, better take a side than ignoring its existence, or worse, taking it for granted and as normal.. Saying ridiculous things like capitalism is founded on violence is one of the many reasons you arent taken seriously.. It's the truth regardless of your feelings about it..

Don't really know what the point of your comment is. Desperate personal attacks?. personal attack? Hardly. You don't know any of these people, you cant possibly know they aren't fascists, and no amount of education would make that possible.

The point is that America doesn't care about threats to democracy they care about threats to themselves. . Regimes like Dutertes or Chinas spreading are a threat to global democracy so your argument is simply a bald assertion running counter to the present example. . What about regimes like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq when we supported them in the 80s, and Iran when we supported them before the revolution? America does NOT give a shit about democracy. . Yeah, just ignore that whole Arab spring thing that happened.... I missed the Arab Spring in Saudi. You want the US to support democracy or you want them to be the world police?

Nimitz-class and the Gerald R Ford-class, you could argue the two British Queen Elizabeth-class as supercarriers but I wouldn't since they lack CATOBAR.. Yeah I def would say theyre super carriers. They do the same job as the us super carriers, the lack of catobar isnt a huge deal really. It means no EA-18, no E-2C/D and no F-35C. Last I read they were using some old Sea Kings for AEW with Merlin HM2s replacing it with a dedicated package. There is no electronic warfare equivalent, so I wouldn't say they do the same job. CATOBAR just ended up costing too much.

The GDPR applies to non-European companies that provide their services to European customers as well.. Most apps aren't made by large international companies.. Your point being? If I provide my product to customers in a certain country, I have to make sure it complies with their laws, whether I'm the head of a large international company or just a family business.   Imagine a contractor not giving a shit about building regulations, and the supposed justification for it is well, it's up to code in **my** country. Doesn't work that way. . The internet is different.  They might not be trying to provide their services in your country.   Actually, for certain products, you might be the one breaking the EULA by using it outside of the jurisdiction they require.  I mean, they don't care, ad money is ad money, but they aren't going to change their shit because of it.. > They might not be trying to provide their services in your country.   It's not like every app store provides developers with the possibility to only make their application available in certain regions, right? If it's available in a region where it doesn't comply with the laws, it's simply because the developers didn't give a shit. . You obviously aren't a software developer. When people make apps they're not going to hire a team of international lawyers to pour over all the details of some app they put in the store for fun. That's not realistic in any sense. . Yeah, so they don't give a shit, as I said. I'm not judging, I'm just saying that it's on the developers, and there's really no excuse or justification, other than they don't care. The reason for not caring might be quite understandable, but that doesn't change anything I said.

Someone illegally obtains a gun.... and then illegally shoots people...  in a place guns are ALREADY banned...  How does making it doubly illegal to obtain a gun helpful?

So when he's saying that he'd rather live in the US than anywhere else, he's wrong? It's just how he feels man.

At my previous work in China, the newly hired janitors tried cleaning the cafeteria tables with the mops they had used on the floor. They also didn't think they had to change the mop water, so they were just spreading dirt after a while.   The things you apparently have to teach some people.... This is not China, but when I stayed in a 4 star hotel in Ottawa one time, I saw the cleaning lady using the same cloth she clean toilet with to clean the bath tube and sink counter. This is why you never take bath in a hotel regardless how reputable it is.. This  can happen in office buildings in North America too. The cleaning staff in some clean the bathroom and the offices with the same cloth. Wiping down phones etc. That is why when I travel I take gloves and lysol wipes and wipe everything down in the hotel as soon as I enter starting with the remote. And clean the bathroom as well before doing anything else.. Christ, idk if my OCD can handle all these truths.. You can use black light to check out all the sperm stains on the chairs and mattresses of the hotel rooms. I think Im better not knowing U0001f637U0001f62d. Believe me I sleep much more sound after cleaning the place myself. And a lot of hotels now give you the option to not have the cleaners in while you stay. I opt for that. The last time we got credit at the restaurant for each day the cleaners didn't come in and we used it for breakfast on the last day. They will give you towels as needed. Works for me.. Thanks for the tip!

t3_7orkpe	0	*	Austrias president was forced to intervene after the first child to be born in the country in 2018 was subjected to a torrent of racist online abuse when it emerged the new-born's parents were Muslim.. I'm starting to wonder if we really *can't* all get along.. We can't. Without help. We're too stupid, in general. And rich people push their agendas on us through the media, which twists our world view even more. Muslims bad, gays bad, Jews bad. Oil good. Coal good. Low corporation tax good. Universal health care bad. Free education bad.   And people swallow all of this, just because.  . Yeah, that isn't really why.. Intelligence and emotional intelligence are certainly part of the reason we struggle to get along. It's a huge statement you've made though, so certainly the reason is a lot more complex than that.. The main driver is that we're hardwired to be mistrustful of the unfamiliar, and that extends to other people as well. Intelligent people have this trait as well, no matter how much one may try to deny that. Though there is a difference between your stereotypical, run-of-the-mill racist and someone who recognizes one's preference for the familiar and accepts that it's only a preference.. Surely a more emotionally intelligent person would have the resources to acknowledge this 'hardwiring' and take positives steps to compensate for it.  Also, back to my original statement. If our media is pushing an agenda that triggers this hardwiring, how does that not affect our ability to get along? . I didn't say 'softwiring', so no. Can you overcome your thirst, your hunger? Your need for sugar and salt? No. An analogy would be someone who eats whatever, compared to someone who eats a well-balanced diet.  Oh, and I'm not to say media doesn't influence our collective opinions. I was just saying that the cart was being put before the horse.. I respectfully disagree. Of course you can compensate for your mistrust of the unfamiliar. I would argue that it is indeed 'softwired'.   Also, comparing a reaction to the unfamiliar to biological needs for survival is extreme and not at all the same level.

I hate seeing that sign on the Taconic.. 436 acres in New York sounds reasonable to me to be worth 100 million. Where I live, an 8000 sqft lot costs around 60k. That's about 1/5th of an acre. So 1 acre is roughly $480,000. Round it up to half a million, multiply by 436 acres, and you get roughly $218 million. Consider that this is probably not prime development land, but still a large plot of land. 100 million sounds reasonable.. He did buy the land first. So even if he paid a third if what he claimed, he'd barely brake even...which he probably paid more than jist a third if 100 mil. So, the guy lost momey on the deal and tye state got a 100 acre park, that it wouldnt fund at only 2500 a year.. He paid $2 million for the land, even with the added costs of trying to convert it into a golf course and advisors he still wouldnt have made a loss.. On the wikis it mentioned that its basically rotting away with weed infested parking lots and abandoned asbestos buildings. Why wouldnt these towns want a private golf course? . From what I read there was problems with environmental restrictions and permits, he probably could have converted it if the restrictions were followed. It could be argued that the land would be better used for other purposes than a golf course such as housing which is why the residents of towns didnt want a golf course.

Reddit being Reddit one will be correct and the other met with outrage.. I kinda agree with both though.. I'm a little from both as well, but people's refusal to understand the other frustrates me.. If you're for the conservation of animals I do not see how you could be against humane hunting practices.. Really? You don't see how people who love animals might be sad when animals are killed? You might not agree with them but surely you can see why they might feel like that?. Animals are killed constantly, in much more horrific and agonizing ways than a bullet through the heart.. So are people, but you wouldn't want to be shot either. That's true. But I'd rather be shot than have my guts ripped out by a bear while I'm alive and screaming and my parents and family are watching.

Maybe she only had those duties so they could say they aren't furniture, and it's the sort of thing you could train a monkey to do.. These are contractors typically hired through an agency so they are most likely paid by the hour.  All this has done is reduced their income.  Well done?.

Germany is doing great things and I like it. . They use a lot of coal power plants, 40%+ of electricity comes from coal.  Renewable sources do not really replace coal but rather nuclear.. Still an impressive ramp-up.. Yes, but it is largely neutral on emissions since it seems to mostly replace nuclear.  The most important is to reduce emissions.. Yeah its just a good headline, but dose nothing for emissions . If it makes renewables cheaper and helps renewable companies/industry compete more with coal it definitely does. . I wonder how the cost of renewables compare to the price of coal at the moment. 2x? 20x?   . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source  Scroll down to Germany - it's not quite 20, and the data is a few years old, but it's still significantly cheaper for coal. Coal is also far more reliable as a source (no sun/wind, no power)

What will Germany do with that surplus?. with that kind of revenue they could BUILD A WALLL!. we already tried that once. surprisingly, it didnt went well... . It went well for 28 years.. Just on a more serious note:    It worked because they added a death zone to it, and a shit load of soldiers to it.   If you are willing to discard all humanity and add a few dozens of soldiers to every few miles of wall 24/7 for eternity... then it can work.. There was a death zone on the Berlin wall, and thousands still crossed it. So, let's take the same concept, but extend the wall and not explicitly call it a death zone around it. This will surely work. Trump, apparently.. Also let's put two oceans on either side of the wall and hope they don't have Boats.  And a shit ton of airports on either side of the wall and hope they don't use planes.  . They actually had constant navy crossing around there to detect people who try to flee.

If you are talking about the US, we are nowhere near being able to pay off any debt.  . We make more money per year than we have in debt. If we stop spending more, we could have it paid off in 20 years. If we cut down on spending, we could pay it off sooner. Instead our debt is increasing much faster than our revenue is increasing. Our debt will probably overtake our yearly income in the next 5 years at the rate we're going.. How much could we reduce spending without causing the next economic downturn? No one knows.....

But their military, that is supposed to lead NATOs rapid deployment force soon, doesn't have enough tents, or winter clothes.. Surprisingly, Europeans are fine with Germany not having an overwhelmingly strong military.. It needs to be stronger. We should not depend on the US. We also shouldn't repeat the american mistake of burning a third of our budget on the military.. The USA does not spend a third of its budget on the military. You forget the federal/state divide in the USA. The state level budgets far exceed the federal budget.   Its better to compare defense spending to GDP. In the USA thats about 3.5%. true, i was being hyperbolic.   i know it pisses americans off, but military spending is simply a waste of money for half the european countries. which is why many will never meet the nato goal.. Because of America.

It really doesn't matter what you spend the money on it is absolutely impossible for everyone to have a surplus.. Not when there is growth. . Wrong.    Private sector deficit plus public deficit plus trade deficit must always sum to zero by definition.

There's no point comparing to landlocked nations as its difficult for them to access open sea  . I took your post to mean for the world. Chinas consumption is not low. I am Asian in Asia. We all eat a lot of fish. For this area, lower than the others, maybe so. 
t3_7smvh8	1	*	Pope Francis: Fake news leads to the spread of 'arrogance and hatred'. I'm not trying to be edgy here, but I could say the same about religion throughout the ages. Not that I like fake news mind you. This just seems a bit like the pot calling the kettle black. . Just because he's the highest member of a religion, doesnt mean that he's like the ones who also were 500 years ago. Pope Francis represented a big change in Roman Catholicism, and that's one more of his attempts to change one of the most powerful institutions in the world: by giving it transparency. . What exactly has he changed asides from a different PR strategy? He said he was starting up a task force to stop pedophiles in the church. That was years ago and nothing came of it. . Gays are being accepted.. Not true. They are just no longer prosecuted or hated by the Church simply for their sexuality. But that is far from acceptance, or even far from tolerance really.. Uh, thats a fucking enormous departure from previous policy.  Thats not good enough is a far cry from thats the same thing. It should never have been a thing in the first place. . Woah, Captian Hindsight over here   Duh, a lot of things in history shouldn't have happened in the first place. Slavery, genicides, etc etc. Most people know that NOW because our morals and society have evolved over time    The point is the church's morals are evolving. Slower than modern Western society obviously but at least they are moving in the right direction.

Hes moving towards allowing married men to become priests for one thing. Pretty big deal. . What exactly does that do for the world, or even simpler for his church's congregation? That's like saying he's moving paychecks to direct deposit. Who cares? . More priests to choose from, more good priests, less bad priests. . How is there less bad priests? This just means more priests. He seems to be under the impression that married priests have les chance to be abusers. This is false.. Im saying thats the benefit of the policy.

It's amazing how all these replies are just people either adding to the edge or people getting triggered that I'm not a vocal atheist. I'm not even religious but it's pretty edgy when people go around and tell others what they should and shouldn't believe in.. Are you telling people they shouldn't believe in telling others what they shouldn't believe?  . You're using believe under a different definition than I was. You're really trying to take things out of context. Are you saying religious beliefs have a special status?  What about political and moral beliefs, should people not say anything about those to each other either?    The conclusion of this type of reasoning is a forfeiture of free expression and a kind of suffocating Victorian etiquette.  . >Are you saying religious beliefs have a special status?  They do. It's written into law that religious groups get special treatments, tax exemptions etc.

Regardless of economics, shouldnt we treat our neighbors with respect?. like respecting a border? hmmm... Like, you know, respecting each other.. Like not encouraging mass migration?. Like, you know, respecting the individuals. Like shooting them and then hiding in a sanctuary city?

Edit: ffs people...   /s!! . Only to rebuke them months later. OKAY. Of course. You think hes going to put people he want in the firing line. This is all going exactly to plan. The fact you cant see it is kind of funny. Trumps moves are so brilliant and strategic its going to red pill so many people so soon we may see a new America rise up sooner than 4 years.. New America = Russian state?. Russian partner. No need to over egg it. Again, if trump tries to end American Democracy to make himself a dictator, Civil War 2 Electric Boogaloo will happen.. I doubt it. The hippies will be too stoned to do anything about it.

Thank God it's only WaPo that makes stuff up.. How is that related to WaPo making stuff up?. My obvious point is that no media can be fully trusted on their own, and no media, regardless of who they are, can be fully trusted.. That is no excuse for WaPo making stuff up . You're right.  There is no good reason for any media to intentionally fabricate misinformation.  Alas, they all do it to some degree.

Last time i checked, quality of life is just fine under trump. - Obstruction of Justice - Failure to uphold the Constitution - Perjury. Bet you weren't asking for an Obama impeachment were you . What did he do that was worthy of impeachment? . Helping arm and fund terrorists on multiple occasions?. You mean what Reagan did?. Reagan was a good man that was [warned early](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan) not to get in the way of the perpetual war machine and criminal cartel inside the US/western governments.  He did exactly what you're alleging, but it's a bit different when there is a gun being held to your head.

Wow just think about how absurd that is.. Even more absurd 40 years from now and kids in school are gonna read about it in history books.. It's weird to think about Twitter as a primary source.. You think that's absurd, just wait for the Donald J Trump presidential library. Just a wall with scrolling tweets projected on it, and 3000 copies of Art of the Deal in the gift shop. . Fuck.  It really hurts my soul to read the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library  Like...that's a thing that will happen.. It's like the Stephen Hawking gym of walking.

Aragorn became king at ~88, but he was also part elf and part god. I doubt Trump can say the same.. No, he was from the land of Numenor.. Numenorians are part elf though. . Really? I thought they were long lived early men. Cool to know.. It's not 100% clear if their long lives were a gift from the gods, a product of their might/stature/heroism, or a consequence of Elros' ancestry. Probably some mix of all.

It would be better if they sold components such as batteries to companies like Ford and Chrysler. . while true, i believe more competition is better for the consumer in the long run. There's already plenty of competition in the automotive sector.  . And how is more worse? I don't see a point to your argument. There's an optimum level of competition, anything above or below that becomes inefficient. . So it was absolutely perfect before telsa came along was it, come one man...

This should be big news for the sake of public influence for justice. . Instead, very soon this poor sod will likely show up with a clear case of heart attack. Inside of a sports bag.. Naw he will suicide himself with 2 gun shot wounds to the back of the head.. Side note: back of the head part aside, two-shot suicides are not at all uncommon...... Could you elaborate on how that is possible? Genuinely cant wrap my head around the idea. Not am expert but you don't die instantly to a gunshot usually so you would definitely have time to gert two shots off with a semi auto weapon. You don't die instantly, but if you fuck it up, you're likely not going to retain the motor function to fire a second shot.. Once was hunting, shot and knocked down one deer immediately, however there deer behind him lost his right front leg and ran off into the woods. Where you get shot definitely effects responsiveness after being shot.

China didn't have  - a succession of shaky govts which kept getting overthrown by the military     - religious fundamentalism and terrorism tearing the country apart   - a continuous decades long pattern of capital and high net worth individuals fleeing the country. You're right with the first point.  For the second point there are groups such as the Falun Gong, but they got stamped out of the China.  For the third point, I don't think you can say that with a straight face...
