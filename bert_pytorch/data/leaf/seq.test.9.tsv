I don't know if this is part of it, but yes, China has been planting trees and plants around the Gobi Desert to stop the increasing desertification..

Beautiful resorts, but why would someone wish to drop 5 figures on a vacation propping up a corrupt dictatorship?  . i ask myself the same when someone visits china.. I also ask myself the same when someone visits the US.. Edgy.  Equating the jailing of the political opposition (Maldives), or active suppression of free speech/thought (China) with the US.. I agree with you but you realize the US has by far the most people in prison per captia? and the most people in prison overall for any country. So what does that say?. The US imprisons a lot of people because of our drug laws and NOT what your political beliefs are.    We could be like Indonesia, Malaysia, or Singapore and threaten execution for drug dealers...  . China imprisons people over drugs to and they still don't get close to our numbers.. hell China have much harsher laws over drugs

Paulo has announced it will no longer publish its articles on social media platform.. They should publish on Reddit and create a subreddit. . Not enough brazilians in reddit.. Come to Brazil. Ok i will try to leave it first them i will try to come back.. Youre in the wrong Brazil /s. There's no right Brazil.. There is no Brazil.. That is totally incorrect, Brazil is a fantastic film by Terry Gilliam released in 1958. 
t1_dszjt0z	1	*	Use of sand vests to calm children with ADHD sparks concern: German schools are increasingly asking unruly and hyperactive children to wear heavy sand-filled vests in an effort to calm them and keep them on their seats, despite the misgivings of some parents and psychiatrists.. This is a terrible decision.  The sandbags will only make them stronger.  They'll be able to bench press their teachers by the time they are adults.. imagine how much faster they will be too, when they finally take off the vests.. In my experience running with weights is a terrible idea. Ive never seen any serious runner doing it or recommending it.. Except for the entire military.. They dont train just to run fast, they train to run fast with 40kg of luggage on their backs and heavy boots on their feet. If thats your goal then maybe some training with weight is a good idea.. Not to mention they generally accept that there people will be physically broken by 40 so not the greatest model for the average person. . Beats lead poisoning at 21.. It's alcohol poisoning at 21. Lead poisoning comes around 19 or 20.
t1_dslp2et	1	*	Rocket Booster Falls from Sky and Explodes in Chinese Town After Satellite Launch. That was surreal. The orange cloud makes it look like a dirty bomb. It's rocket fuel. It's still incredibly toxic.. Most likely dinitrogen tetroxide. Which is best case. If it's that then they'll have a ton of sick peoples. If it's hydrazine then that towns gonna have a lot of deaths. Not hydrazine? That looks like hydrazine smoke to me.  Edit: Due to a post further down by /u/pepf with the rocket type(Longmarch 3B/E), it is definitely Dinitrogyn Tetroxide.. When hydrazine explodes it's yellow not orange/red . Is is actually a combination of both, the rocket booster in question uses a hypergolic mixture of Dinitrogentetraoxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine.. Fun so that town is gonna get super sick and have deaths. Everyone in those videos is so excited, some are cheering, some got close. I'm sure they are all painfully unaware of how toxic that immediate area is.

Different name today, same old behavior tho. Kinda like new coke.. Bad analogy, New Coke was a shift to shittier ingredients that was branded as an improvement.. See you say that, but in blind taste tests, people actually preferred New Coke over Classic.. Because it was sweeter, basically a Pepsi clone, in response to Cokes losing The Pepsi Challenge all the time.   What was that burger McDonalds made to try to be like the Whopper?. Big and Tasty maybe?. Can't remember, but it was an obvious attempt to grab that little bit of market share that insisted on a Whopper-shaped burger.  They did McPizza for awhile, too, if I remember right.. McPizza was great! Subway did pizza for a while recently too. I liked it!

Would a decent American run like a bitch if persecuted by their government?  I'll applaud anybody that stands up to a rifle with nothing more than a middle finger.. Yea they would. Look a Snowden and assange . Snowden has already said that he'd return if he was guaranteed a trial in a non-military court.  You'll note that was never offered.. Traitors don't get to make demands. . Are you referring to the American government that betrayed it's citizens and illegal surveilled them?  Because that's pretty fucking traitorous.

Those cunts on the chinese fishing boats try to ram coast guard boats? Oo. Those Chinese boats are a part of the PLAN, ramming is just one of their tactics.. Sink them along with the entire crew except one who gets to live to tell the tale.. Yeah fight illegality with illegality. . If they attack you blow them straight into hell.. Yes but you can't shoot all but one them. If their ship is sunk/sinking it's a war crime to continue shooting.. Use a Minigun problem solved totally didn't sink it.

I don't know how many times in person or on TV I have heard women say men are stupid, useless, or sexist.. The basic problem here is that France does not have free speech laws like the US does.. Verbal assault isn't covered by free speech in the US either.. Making sexists remarks is legal.. That's not what this is about though. The title is misleading.. It is still ridiculous to ban speech that isn't an imminent threat or slander.. What's ridiculous is not having the right to be treated with minimum courtesy.. You don't have a right to not be offended.

My paycheck only went up $9, wowee so much winning.. How about your retirement account? Mines kicking ass.. Dont have a retirement account! Im planning to work until I die.

That's not what the court said - it's for both parents to agree on, not just the mother. Why does the child have no say?. When have children ever had a say in their own upbringing?.

If men get to stay home and have wealthy women marry them and provide money I'm sure most would be OK with it.. Ah yes, it's okay that you're treated unequally because occasionally it's comfortable discrimination.. Im just saying if you want to discriminate against men atleast give the benefits, too. Personally, no discrimination would be the ideal.. We already got our benefits, do you not understand this?. No, men in the past got their benefits. Were not men in the past.

t1_duigmhu	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. Its stupid that I have to pay a much higher tax rate than billionaires and trust fund kids who never lift a fucking finger.   The current tax code is class warfare and the middle class is losing.. Also the upper middle class and anyone making a couple hundred thousand dollars salary. Income tax really hits mid to high salary people hard. Yeah me and my wife do pretty well but after childcare,property taxes and healthcare costs solid 6 figures isnt what it used to be even in the Midwest. . Try it in NJ, it's ridiculous here.. I grew up in a modest house in central NJ.  The property taxes on the house was almost double what I pay a year to rent in VA.  I don't know how most of my friends from home that stayed manage.    . > central NJ  You know how I know you're lying?. Princeton?. West Jersey isn't Jersey, doesn't count.

Why do you say that?  Would it be illogical to blame people who drive hummers for wasting gas?. I don't think that's an accurate analogy. We've been eating meat since we've existed. Cars are a created thing and it's just as easy to buy a different car. We aren't inclined to drive certain cars.

In 2011 they attempted to attack the USS Sterett  and Enterprise aircraft carrier, after they hijacked a yacht. Look up the SY Quest incident.. They attacked the enterprise?  Please tell me their is a recording of crew/command reactions as it happened.  Because that has to be the most desperately suicidal thing i could imagine..

And connectors are needed to have the computer run, no?. Yeah they are, and sterob is probably wants their processor to not have any gold plated contacts either..

Not really, it will be tied up in lawsuits and environmental reviews and then cancelled when the Republicans are swept out of office.. One can hope.

Dont you see that arming people who never wanted to be armed and by and large arent comfortable with the idea will deter all future school shootings?. I didn't realize the proposal was forcing every teacher to be armed, as opposed to being an option.   Oh what? Nobody would be **forced** to carry? Wild. . So then almost no one would? Genius! School shootings solved!. If even 5% start carrying these shooters will target the next easiest gun free zone. Remember these people are cowards who want easy kills for the infamy. If it's truly a mental health issue and has nothing to do with guns, won't they just blow up school buses or something?. I never said it was a mental health issue. Blowing up school buses is doable but it wouldn't produce the same fame which is kind of a big reason for doing it.

Actually illegal aliens in the US have been trying to sneak into Canada out of fear of deportation and Canada turns them away. Actually Canada is accepting over 60% of them.. Yes because American skilled workers tend to be valuable to other economies. We're sending our best.   Edit: downvotes for telling the truth? Sorry you don't like facts.

The democratic process is over. He wants to have a second vote to reverse the majority will expressed in the first vote. You act like Brexit issue wasnt voted on already.. Having another vote would still be democratic. . That's like saying having another election right after one election is democratic.. Happens all the time.

So democracy means people only get to vote on things once and that's final?. Eventually you could have a revote, but you can't just immediately do it. You need to see the people's will through.. That's ridiculous. And how can you call it the people's will when the people were deliberately misinformed.. Misinformed is not a code word for anyone who does not agree with you. Get over yourself.. No, the Leave campaign actively lied, then all the leaders of the campaign ran away as soon as their side won, leaving everyone else to clean the bed. . That's the socially acceptable way of saying the other side is dumb  They just disagreed with you, and they won. If you want to change it, vote in a different government

No direct cites, but I recall from my forestry days that Japan, covered in introduced conifers, hardly had a domestic industry at all, and prefers to rape SE Asia and the Pacific. . Classic japan. Smart but diabolical, these are the people who wanted to use the power of the Jews when Hitler said they controlled the world.. Actually they did to the Koreans what the Germans did to the Jews.. They did some horrible shit but were a cut below the Nazis on the scale of evil. People tend to think that. But they were pretty equal in the amount of people they killed in the name of ethnic cleansing.. True but their methods of doing so weren't quite as vile, thats why I consider them a step below the Nazis.

There was an incident where someone was trying to B&E into the embassy, the police were called, and it took them like an hour to arrive. . 1 hour is normal even if the station is next door.. Yes but not normal if he is surrounded by cops watching him 24/7 as he previously was an as some people believe he still is. . Unless they didn't want to blow their cover.... Or they are a little peeved that Ecuador is protecting Assange so they took their sweet old time showing up as a bit of revenge.
t1_du7ast2	1	*	WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange loses bid to have UK arrest warrant dropped. Julian is gonna spend the rest of his life in that embassy if he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in an American jail. He made a conscious decision to be a shill for Russian intelligence. . When a presidential candidate jokes about killing you with a drone you grab onto anyone that can save you.. Never happened.. Pretty plausible. She's got (/had?) a dry sense of humour by all accounts. Doesn't mean she actually advocated killing him.. But it didn't happen. She never said it and no one says she did.. Obviously someone said she did or else we wouldn't be discussing it, genius.. People are saying newtovegas4742 killed someone in 2006.  Maybe not anyone credible but people are saying it and I think it's worth discussing.

Better make sure to change them back before we take back Washington.. Simple math says that democrats can't take congress if that's what you're implying.. That's objectively false, they can get a majority in both houses, though not a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. . The only things up in 2018 are basically all red areas. Roy Moore was just a one time thing also. . Democrats only need to gain two seats to have a 51 seat majority. Its definitely feasible for the Democrats to achieve that in the current environment. . It's actually not.. explain. Explain how it is.

When are these little fat cats going to pay their fair share???. Wait till we start giving them guns.  Just kidding! Haha! What kind of civilized country would ~~let~~ give minors ~~buy~~ easy access guns!. America sure doesn't, so who knows.. Not a handgun, but long guns? Yep, sure can. Rifles, shotguns, etc.  There are a few places where they can't, but its not prohibited overall. I'm not sure where that's the case, but I can see the logic. After all, long guns are used in under 3% of firearms deaths. It's less dangerous than giving your kid a car.. Fair enough. Though note that ~~most~~ about a third of accidental firearm deaths in the US involve teenagers and people in their early 20's.. Most of a minuscule number isn't a crisis.. Hundreds of deaths yearly due to accidental shootings is not a miniscule number.  Though I should clarify that after checking, it wasn't a majority, it was around 1/3rd who were under 25.

There's actually a bazooka in use today that has a 9mm rifle attached to it and it is called the Shoulder-launched Multi-purpose  *Assault* Weapon.. That 9mm isnt used for the assault part though. Its a tracer thats used as a spotting round to better range in the rocket that generally comes soon after.. Why 9mm though? A 7.62 would be a better choice. It dosent curve off after 50 meters. You know what does curve off after 50 meters though? A 4.2/4.5kg rocket. The tracer is designed such that it will (mostly) follow the trajectory the rocket would.   For ranging.

Nope, that directly harms them, I would never circumcise my kids for aesthetics alone, especially if it injures them.. Doesn't harm them any more than boys.. Depends on how its done..

Also found on the plane, parts to assemble military-style rifles. Why did they have weapons it's a church. I carry a gun at church. Hello fellow murican. I mean, blacks tend to have this bad history of having their churches being targeted. I'm not willing to be a bystander or a victim. I mean as long as you're not shooting up the church I don't see the problem.  However bringing your gun to church might be the most American thing I've heard today. Jesus totally told His followers to pack heat which is why when Peter cut off the centurions ear, Jesus said I wish you had your glock, dude. . Blessed are the meek, especially if they're packing heat.. The meek? Oh that's nice.

Same is true for AI generated porn. . No.  They own their likeness and didn't consent to it being used.  Likewise the trainer images are owned by the photographers.  So there are lots of big differences.. If that were true, gossip magazines that print nonconsentual paparazzi photos wouldn't be able to exist. Any celebrity who has a nipple slip would be able to sue the magazine to oblivion. . Reread the part where I mention photographs are IP of the photographer.. So, if deep fakes were only made using public domain images, they would be fine? . That would deal with one of those two problems.

No one gives a fuck what you think, you're not the president calling allies shitholes. post colonial independent nations. they fought for their countries freedom from a colonial power.... sounds familiar? . Haiti though actually gained its independence as a result of a slave revolt during the French Revolution.. That's actually a major reason it's so poor. After it gained independence pretty much every country refused to trade with it because they feared their slaves might try something similar.. How long has it been since slavery was banned in the US and Europe?. US? 1865  Europe varies wildly by country, and many continued to allow it in their colonies long after it was outlawed in the country proper.. So it's had quite a bit of time to build itself up.. It's not exactly that simple to completely turn things around after decades of crippling poverty.

It's such a cruel attack, I hope they jack up the consequences enormously for the perpetrators, similar to murder or at the very least attempted murder. You don't ever heal from that kind of wound. . Chemical weapons are a crime against humanity. Using acid against people should be a life sentence.. It already is in UK: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/04/people-who-carry-out-life-changing-acid-attacks-face-life-sentences.

She was a schoolgirl who attacked a classmate, its abhorrent but not exactly a normal case. Your comment doesn't sound good at all. It comes across that what happened isn't a big deal because she's a schoolgirl?. We tend not to hold children to the same account as adults

It's almost as if prices exploding and nobody having any money due to  welfare and wages and public services sabotaged at every turns had something to do with it /S. You'd be surprised how many people I've met that said 'why buy a house when rent is cheaper in the long run?'.. It's cheaper in terms of money, but very costly in terms of lack of autonomy and security.. The money you save on it can be put into investments.. Well, that's true enough. I don't know that most people are sufficiently competent to do this.. They're not. Instead, they go on reddit to complain.. Ok, and are you gonna try to help them?. nah
t1_dtbcy7y	1	*	China has announced plans to develop shipping lanes through the Arctic to become a Polar Silk Route. Beijing said global warming meant viable routes through the Arctic would become important for international trade. China would work with Russia and other Arctic countries to develop the route.. This will be interesting since any global route will need to run through Canada and Canada considers the Arctic it's sovereign territory.. Well, the parts of it that run through Nunavut.  There is another route that goes across Russia which China can also use to get to Europe.. Canada can build Islands, and accuse China of violating it's Sovereignty if it uses those waters.. Canada doesn't even have the capability of enforcing its claimed sovereignty to waters between its own islands.  The idea of even doing so is something that is relatively new.. Im sure the US would be happy to oblige the neighbors. Were already sailing all around the SCS, we could spare some ships to help Canada defend their sovereign waters.. Nope.  The US stance on the Northwest Passage is that it is international waters.  Canada's on its own for that one.. Damnit.  But if Canada built some islands, Im sure we could change our views on manmade islands, yknow, only in the Northern hemisphere.. That's not the reason lol.  It is in the US interest that it is international waters so its own shipping can use it free of charge.

t1_dt6dw0k	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. Trudeau is a complete fucking idiot. We need to get rid of that fuckwit. Na I hope Canada keeps him in office for a long time. With the US cutting tax and regulation it wont be long till we get all your Canadian companies.   . You're right. Us western provinces want to join the US . I reside in one of those, and most of us are really, really glad we aren't the US at the moment.. They have a leader that's working for them, we have one that's working against us . That is entirely a political judgement, and not one shared by the majority of Canadians in any province, if you look at Trudeau's favourables vs. Trump's.. You think government polls mean anything? When you poll certain people in a small area you can severely skew the numbers. I think that properly conducted opinion polling is a completely valid way to measure the mood of the public, particularly when it shows very wide differences well outside the margin of error.

Well, the orange shit still havent started any wars or made a huge impact on the world besides every other country making fun of the US president..

Yeah but mostly just the salt water. The salt water definitely makes gluing all the little pieces back together more difficult.    But after today I believe they can pull off just about anything =). How did NASA recover the shuttle boosters since those got soaked?. Floated back via a recovery barge, usually. And an almost complete rebuild.

I knew it was pretty quick, just a bit peeved it took this long for Puerto Rico, when it was so fast for a country that's been effectively blockaded for the last 50 years..

It likely was, as public services are high on Cuba's list of important stuff.. Cant have a revolution if people are happy with what you're doing *taps head with finger*. Also the Cubans probably have a smaller grid because not many people are allowed to use the internet and use less electricity than the average Puerto Rican..

Eritrea is under authoritarian rule, so anyone escaping there is considered a refugee. . Except under international law a refugee ceases to be one once they leave a safe or stable countrys borders. So theyd only be considered refugees in Ethiopia, Djibouti, or Sudan.. fuck international law, man, there's FEELINGS on the line here!. Your buddy there failed to cite said law because there isn't one, so you and he are the ones who seem to believe things based on your feefees rather than the facts.. I actually didn't say anything at all in that comment about anything I do or don't believe, but whatever you say sweetie.. LOL.

UN must pass a strict rule against countries that attack hospitals . I agree Russia/Syria are very barbaric. . Cut the shit. It's war. The US and Israel bomb hospitals too. . Errm no not intentionally, these are targeted. A country who gasses there own citizens certainly will do this.   . Not Intentionally... U0001f914. When a strike hits 10 damn hospitals it's intentional and sometimes the same one 2 or 3 times within an hour. That is a war crime.. With today's technology, do you think the US doesn't mean to hit exactly where it hits?. You should maybe read the report on why the hospital you're referring to was hit.

And yet we can't bring ourselves to stop using this one particular type of oil.   Our fucking species is out of its collective mind.. Its easier for the big companies to continue what theyre doing. Most of the *we* youre speaking of doesnt even know what palm oil is or what its in.. Capitalism is the most ethical means of distributing wealth:. Not everything can be blamed on capitalism. If proper regulations and enforcement were put in place, this wouldn't be an issue. *Pure* capitalism is a problem, just like pure communism/socialism. Why haven't proper regulations been put in place already, before the orangutan population dropped by 100,000?. Because of corruption, which is far from being unique to capitalism. When a system institutionalizes corruption, almost by design, should we blame corruption itself or that system?. And Communism *isn't* corrupt as fuck? Jesus Christ, come on.

Morals come from good parenting and experiencing a world where you know that you dont have all the answers of life and existence. Kind of a Nature and nurture thing then right? What is good parenting? . Teaching kids how to think critically.  Also the empathy parents show to others directly correlates to the empathy the kids will have in the world . What tells you empathy is important?. Do you even have a grasp on what empathy is?

The guy who can get the most empanadas without moving from his position will be.. An election based on availability of stuffed pastry is no basis for a system of government!. Can you name a better one?

Shes fought back with her own online video campaign.. The history of Russia can be summed up with the phrase *But then, it got worse...*  . Apart from the period of time around WW2, it has always been getting better.. ...For the oligarchs.. Oligarchs are a pretty modern concept in Russia, but no, it's been getting a lot better for the ordinary people, especially over the past 18 years.. The communist party leadership were oligarchs.  You might want to look up the definition, essentially every country has a group that can be referred to as such.. Not in the modern sense of the word, they weren't wealthy for example. If you say that it only means people in power, then every country was always ruled by oligarchs since the dawn of time.. Yeah it's weird it's like the term was created to describe that kind of person. It's not though.  Oligarch is a specific word that means a very specific thing.  A thing that did not exist in the USSR nor was it possible to exist in the USSR.

I hate to break the anti-circlejerk, but what about all those doctors and lawyers that still have that student debt well into their lucrative careers. . They make enough money that the investment was worth it. The debt still follows them and can cripple them, I mean partly because they typically will buy a house or buy high rent also, but yea it can be very difficult.. Thats why doctors and lawyers are well paid. The whole point is even well paid people get fucked by student debt, so it's a problem with the system not just interpretive dance majors or whatever the fuck people complain about. . How are they fucked?  They chose to take a loan out to further their education and they pay it back.  Not the biggest deal, especially if you are successful

Don't bother the guy is a literal neo-nazi. He is known to most people who frequent /r/austria. thanks for the heads up. then again you could have guessed from how supportive he is of Nazis .

t1_dukpdwg	1	*	Trump Forest - a global reforestation project aiming to offset Trump's anti-climate policies - has reached 1 million trees after thousands of pledges from around the world.. Can someone name his anti-climate policies for me?  I get that he didn't sign the worthless Paris accord but what else is there.. Promotion of coal industry and slashing EPA budget comes immediately to mind. Do you need sources, or are you just baiting?. Clean coal is far safer than what the climate alarmists say.. There is no just thing as clean coal.. If we can have free health care and free college on Reddit we can have clean coal too.  . I'm not sure if you are aware of this...but many other countries have free health care and free college. However, none have figured out how to burn coal cleanly - because its impossible. What country has free health care and free college?. Ones that would be absolutely fucked if they couldn't not depend on the US in a defense situation.

In a few weeks, he is going to brag about a forest being named after him because he is doing so much for the environment. Just watch.. I feel like whoever named it didn't put much thought into it.. Yeah, it kind of proves the republican point that stuff like this doesnt need government funding since volunteers and the private sector will take care of it if there is a big enough need.. Darn, those damn Republicans were right about something fuck how can we oppose the next Republican idea or value.. Republicans destroy something, volunteers restore less than 1%, see? who needs the government! . Kind of like the riots by liberals that destroyed people's livelihoods after Trump won the election?. what riots. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/11/11/anti-trump-protesters-pepper-sprayed-demonstrations-erupt-across-us/93633154/
t1_dtgsljq	0	*	Big game hunter shot dead while hunting lions in Africa. 50/50 whether this thread decides Fuck him, he deserved it. Or The sale of hunting permits is essential to fund conservation.  Reddit being Reddit one will be correct and the other met with outrage.. I kinda agree with both though.. I'm a little from both as well, but people's refusal to understand the other frustrates me.. If you're for the conservation of animals I do not see how you could be against humane hunting practices.. Really? You don't see how people who love animals might be sad when animals are killed? You might not agree with them but surely you can see why they might feel like that?. Animals are killed constantly, in much more horrific and agonizing ways than a bullet through the heart.. So are people, but you wouldn't want to be shot either. That's true. But I'd rather be shot than have my guts ripped out by a bear while I'm alive and screaming and my parents and family are watching.
