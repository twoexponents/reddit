t3_7xuelp	1	*	China reassigns 60,000 soldiers to plant trees in bid to fight pollution. Well isn't China already building a green wall alongside the dessert in the north to stop it from spreading. I don't know if this is part of it, but yes, China has been planting trees and plants around the Gobi Desert to stop the increasing desertification.. Ironically,  the desert helps to seed the ocean which is a greater carbon sink than the forests..  Higher CO2 levels in the ocean lead to issues tho.  (Algae bloom,  jellyfish) . Including ocean acidification! The ocean is not the solution.. How is a gigantic body of water not solution? . Because its a solvent . Pure water is solvent definitely, but shouldnt sea water be considered as solution as it contains minerals and compounds?. Im just typing jokes
t3_7xuelp	1	*	China reassigns 60,000 soldiers to plant trees in bid to fight pollution. Ha redditors still upvoting obvious Chinese BS they never intend to actually do.. They are ***accidentally*** planting trees?. They are probably not doing it all. >probably  Oh okay, you've convinced me.. Lol deep factual arguments here huh?  I just think the Chinese Gov't is generally full of shit about a lot of things. Just my opinion.. > Just my opinion  clearly. Ha come on, like the Chinese are really trust worthy?  They control every aspect of the state and have a totalitarian regime.  For all the USA's flaws it's not remotely on the same level. If you're just gonna call everything China related BS, why even read the article or comment? I mean, it's literally just planting trees. The PLA has a track record of actually doing things like that.. Fair enough.  Thank you for supporting your reasonable arguement

Israelis keep on saying they want a peace agreement, while funding settlers all over west bank. this is highly hypocritical.. I would argue its worse. At least Russia was direct. This is lying about peace for years while settlements expand until well its all Israeli now. . No, Russia was not direct.   Those soldiers wearing Russian military uniforms, firing Russian weapons, and coming over the Russian border in Russian equipment? Oh, those are just tourists.. Yeah but nobody really believed it. .

Live in an actual geopolitically valuable third world country for a bit and you will understand, America is the worst influence out of the three major powers.. I actually do, and America is not that bad. It is way better when you compare it to how countries/people were treated by the communist autocratic countries (USSR and China). China treats its own people like shit but helps other countries a lot. It's been like this since Mao's time, they would send grain to the DDR while their own people starved..

Why are heatwaves used to prove global warming exists but cold weather can't be used to say the opposite?. They're both wrong. No single climate event can be directly attributed to global warming. You have to look at the overall trend.. And the trend says the earth has been getting warmer since the end of the ice age. It hasn't been getting warmer this quickly until the Industrial revolution, we also understand the scientific process of how modern industry makes the earth warmer, it isn't just a guess.. Yeah but there isn't a scientific consensus on the matter. I'll wait on that.   Edit: watch this https://youtu.be/uRNO1LFQBWI. You're incorrect, the scientific consensus is that it's human caused. Hmmh I don't think so. If there is one I haven't heard about it. It matters little anyway I guess - science isn't democratic.. yeah it's republican

That Prisoner's Dilemma is going to backfire real fast.. This has nothing to do with a prisoner's dilemma. Just with one side having sufficient leverage to barter a poor deal for the other side..

Fucking hell you people are dense. >  What are you planning to do with your organs once you're dead?  Burn them along with the rest of my body.. What a waste but your option. Exactly. *My* option. My perfectly viable organs are going to go down with me. Fuck other people, like I said.
t3_7xgogl	0	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. As long as there is an option to opt out, then it's not so bad. If it were mandatory that you be a donor, I'd take issue with it. . Why should it be optional if it saves lives.. Because it's not their body to make decisions for. . It's not your body either to make decisions for once you're dead. . What? Are you serious?  . Of course, why should you have a say in what happens to your shell, especially if it can save someone's life? . If you can't figure out the possible ethics nightmare of a scenario where the government takes full control of your shell after you die, there's nothing I can say to help you. . You'll be dead and won't care so.... So that means my wishes are null and void? The wishes of my family? 
t3_7xgogl	1	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. I dont understand why a person wouldnt donate his organs unless for religious reasons. By donating, youll be able to save someones life, which is THE BEST deed possible, in my opinion. . I know a guy who refuses to donate. He is not allowed to donate blood because he is gay, and says that if society considers his blood unfit for donation, they won't get his organs either.. Gay men have a higher chance of contracting AIDS and ststistically have more sexual partners than straight men. I wouldn't accept his blood or organs.. I don't know how things work in your country, but here in Denmark all donors are regulargy tested for HIV, so that's not an issue.. All it takes is one screw up, would rather not accept it at all.. Then you have refuse to recieve blood and organs at all. You wouldn't be in the clear at all, just because the donor was straight.. If they were straight here is a higher chance I would be in he clear. To  refuse blood/organs if I needed it would be stupid. . But regardless of statistics, all it takes is one screw up! You'd better refuse, just to be safe!. Lmao you are so dense

As long as there is an option to opt out, then it's not so bad. If it were mandatory that you be a donor, I'd take issue with it. . If it was mandatory it would be okay too.. Ok for you. . We can have different opinions.  What I really think you should edit on your comment is then it's not *so bad*.  There's nothing bad on that, absolutely nothing.. Of course there is. The original connotation was that it was mandatory. If mandatory, it's inexcusable.  It still should not be the default though. . Out of curiosity, why do you think that way? I can't see anything bad on that, but you obviously do.. Your body is your own. In absence of your own ability to choose, it falls to your family. No government entity has possession of your body to make such decisions for you. . I can agree with that.  I think tho, that if you're not a donor, you should not be eligible for organ donations.  If people think that way, they think that way for everyone, not just for them.. You have a right to feel that way but it would go counter of the Hippocratic Oath. Money aside, you can't hold one's beliefs against them in choosing to treat or not.

I was registered as a Donor, now i've explicitly opted out. This is not just a slippery slope. This is the government deciding that they have a say in the bodies of their people. . Dumbest thing I've read today. . Then you must have not been on the internet for very long today. No, you are just incredibly silly.. silly, stupid. Please, give me an argument that can create a meaningful discussion. Now you just seem like the kind of person that just tells everyone they are stupid. . Why were you a registered organ donor?. I thought it was the right thing to do. But looking at the world, i don't care anymore. People don't deserve the right thing, me in the least. . My condolences. It must be a very lonely existence to believe the best thing in it is yourself. . So, what should be the next step. Every person should be obliged to donate blood on a weekly bases?

Not op but personally I dont want anyone cutting open my body. Even if im dead.. when you are dead it's no longer your body. Well it's not the state's body either.  Also, couldn't you transfer ownership of your body to your family via a will?. > Well it's not the state's body either.  i'd argue in a democracy (especially a social one) everyones body belongs to the people.. Even before death?. theoretically yes, in practice we have social contracts that allow people to have personal freedom, though i don't think that this should excuse ones obligations towards society.. So if a social democracy voted to enslave a minority of the population, that would be morally ok and nobody's rights would be violated? Just the price of the social contract? Seems dubious to me.

Making a sexist comment shouldnt be a crime anywhere. A comment that incites death or bodily injury could be but not this. . Dehumanizing women through sexual harassment incites violence against them.. You lost me at incites violence. Can you link a news article in France where the public was incited into violence over words containing sexist comments?. That's a very specific request. No I don't have any of those on file, but it's pretty well understood how sexist comments contribute to a general attitude of contempt for women by men. There is a line for free speech and unless you establish a link to violence with evidence I would say its an unreasonable restriction.

If youre against illegal immigration you should be against Israels government that funds and supports hundreds of thousands illegal settlements colonizing Palestinian Territories . Jews can be economic migrants. Some jews go to israel because of the economy(although most go because its safer for them).  These africans are specifically non jewish and just moving for the economy.. So only Jews are allowed in Israel. Got it.. Yep and its completely legal by international law. Aw, I'm glad that makes you feel better.. It really does. Soothes the soul like that old time rock and roll. I bet your incel status soothes your soul too.

I'd really like to see the US cut all fossil fuel subsidies.  Is that likely to happen anytime soon?  Not even remotely.. Not as long as world renowned lizard person, and proud destroyer of physical hearts, and owner of one that's not his own, Dick Cheney has any say in the matter.. Not as long as 90% of Americans use gas or diesel powered vehicles, either.. If I could afford to go electric, I would. Unfortunately, it's expensive and most Americans don't make nearly enough to buy in.. If electric cars got the subsidy money oil companies get, i wonder how cheap they could be.. Realistically probably not cheap enough. People dont just buy new cars on a whim, they would have to genuinly be dirt cheap to get any significant percentage of the population to buy a new car.. People buy new cars all the time. If they only bought electric cars instead it'd be problem solved.. They dont though. They buy 'new to them cars.' Its not actually that common for somebody to buy a brand new car in comparison with total drivers in the US.. Everyone buys a car that's new to them.  It doesn't matter how common it is, if everyone who was buying a new car bought electric then eventually all cars would be electric.

Once you're 18 you can cut your whole wanger off, nobody will care, but you definitely shouldn't be cutting any bits off of any children. What doctors recommend it at 18 rather than a newborn???.

We would literally make a ton more food, with a lot less water, little to no pesticides, and less land. . Difficult to beat the efficiency of a field with a building attempting to recreate the conditions of a field, particularly for low value bulk crops.. Maybe you can beat the efficiency, but you can't beat the set-up cost.. It costs practically nothing to set up high tunnels and you get a partially controlled environment out of it.  Vertical farming is only feasible in specific circumstances where land is at a premium.. It costs exactly nothing to cut down trees and throw seeds on the ground. .

t3_7uzz5a	0	*	BBC News: Russian fighter jet 'shot down' in Syria. How different is this really from say, a Spetsnaz soldier being killed during a raid behind enemy lines?  When the Russians venture into enemy territory they know this kind of thing is a possibility.. The actual shooting down of the jet isn't really anything major (in terms of a war). The reports of the pilot being shot while parachuting down is a pretty big thing since it's a war crime.. You're invading a country that's people have been beseeched by war and horror for decades. Do you expect them to invite him down for a cup of tea?. Nice strawman, obviously the only two options are invite down for a cup of tea and commit war crime.. Meh, it shouldn't be a war crime in the first place. I say he was fair game. Fair game to attack a surrendered soldier?. It's fair to attack someone who bombs your cities yes. Feel free to setup your own country and try and argue with the entire international consensus then.. Nice counterargument lol

It has much more I think, like 4-5 million for sure.. I think a few million covers 4-5 million. A few is 2-3, 4-5 is several :).. IMO a couple is 2, a few is 3-5. however the definition of a few is a small number greater than 1 so maybe we are both correct   Either way as a player Im glad its still populated

t3_7xy7l0	1	*	USSR-born and raised oligarch buys most expensive New York townhouse. are we against rich folks now for buying up property?. His money is corrupt. Most likely he got control of resources in Russia during the collapse/transition to Putin in return for his loyalty. . you show me a billionaire, and i'll show you corruption.. J.K. Rowling. she's no longer a billionaire.. Please explain the corruption that made her one in the first place then. . well, copyright i guess.  non-commercial sharing should be legal.. So artists, authors, and any other creative people shouldn't be paid for their work?  She wrote a few books.  She got paid a few dollars for every copy that was sold.  Seems pretty harmless to me.. artists make money by selling their work.  an exclusive copy right is overkill after many millions of dollars.

The Israeli's have become their past tormentors, much like an abused child often grows up to be an abuser without counseling. . 50 far right settlers are not all Israelis.. When all Israelis start protesting these actions, I'll agree with you. So until all Palestinians start protesting the murder of families eating dinner, or bus bombings, they should also be viewed as murderers.. False. Israel has a government and state, thus actions by the state must be viewed as acquiescence from the voting public at large.. Hamas was democratically elected, does that mean all Gazans are terrorists?. Let's talk when those people are citizens of their own state.. Having a state would magically transform the innocent Gazans to bloodthirsty monsters for electing Hamas?. Having a state would give credibility to actions. Right now they are captives of Israel.

Tell that to a Taiwanese or a Tibetan for that matter.. What? Do you think they'd disagree and say north and south korea is more controversial? . If you're asking Tibetans, no. Their land was taken from them directly; they were formerly their own people before Chinese expansion.. And prior to that they were part of china. So whats your point? . I think his point is that we're past the age of feudalism and people have a right to self determination. . So if the south seceded today it's all gravy? What with their right to self determination ect..

I love that Trump likes people from a socialist country and doesnt like people from the uncontrolled capitalist countries.   . They are not socialists. China and Cuba are.. China, at this point, is far more capitalist than the US.  Cuba is communist.   Most of western Europe is democratic elected governments with popular socialist programs including universal heathcare. . It's not more capitalist than USA. No free internet, media, no free religions freedom, no guns, extreme punishment for drug use. This is not a free market.. None of those things have anything to do with capitalism.. It's a free market. Drugs is for example a product you can sell on the free market. How is that not relevant?. Last I checked that's all heavily regulated in the US, even alcohol, quite the opposite of a free market.. It's more free than in China. I was making a comparison.. Free is not a metric of capitalism.

In Denmark and Norway, kids start learning English from grade 1. In any sizeable city, you can *live* perfectly fine with just English.. True - better off moving to Norway if you wanna be around people who speak English rather than America. Not wrong. Yanks are barely comprehensible sometimes, to say nothing of their lacking ability to spell.. Lol you should see the immigrants from shithole countries. I always wonder how they survive day to day.. Immigrants or no, yanks are bad with English. Dun't y'all no?. If you think yanks are bad, wait till you hear an African-American. Aks any one of them.

Untraceable kidnapping and never hear from them again. Russian govt is scary as shit.. Let's mess things up for them then, figure out a system to get US, Canadian and Norwegian oil to replace Russian oil in Germany and Eastern Europe, that'll deal some damage . the US just became the 2nd largest oil producer, producing 10 million barrels per day, surpassing Saudi Arabia. We are on the path to exceed 11 millions barrels per day, which would surpass Russia.... Yes, but our oil has to be put on a bunch of boats.  Russian oil runs through a pipe.  We can't match them on price.

In the case of Iceland, a lot of there energy comes from geo thermal.. Children in Africa could have eaten that geo thermal energy.. Thermal power is a plenty in Africa.. Plenty of geography as well. . Remember the great geography drought of 1875. The effects spanned generations. Some say that to this very day, there are many Americans who cannot locate Canada on a map.. Well its above the states so obviously its not on a map and somewhere in space . But space is a lie that NASA invented, amirite?

Well, Cantonese is still very much in the minority but there are definitely enough regional dialects that no one should expect to be understood in official Mandarin throughout China.

t3_7piy8i	0	*	Canada is increasingly convinced that President Donald Trump will soon announce the United States intends to pull out of NAFTA, two government sources said on Wednesday, sending the Canadian and Mexican currencies lower and hurting stocks. Trump is an overall peice of shit, but sometimes he does good things. This, however, is not one of them. Yes it is. How many US jobs have NAFTA killed since Bill Clinton signed it into law?. Zero.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFTA%27s_effect_on_United_States_employment#Job_creation. Higher paying jobs are being replaced by lower paying ones, even says so in the wiki. .

I never claimed it was accurate. I have doubts about Wolff.  But I don't get why you said I'm sure you think that. It makes no sense..

t3_7rofvh	1	*	US Government Shuts Down. Republican party shuts down. It was actually the democrats who shut it down. . You literally can't blame the minority in this situation, GOP is majority and they couldn't keep it a float.  Fucking party of opposition, not in the business of governing. You can blame the minority when you need more than a majority of the vote. Don't be obtuse. They needed 9 Democrat votes no matter what. . Its called compromise. . And apparently Dems weren't interested, because the government is now shut down, based on how they voted. . Republicans were not in unison. Even if they had 60 seats, they couldn't pass shit.. If 9 Dems supported it, I think all Republicans would have gotten on board. . Far right wouldn't out of spite. Needless to say, by the President's own criticism it is his fault. It had bi-partisan support and it would have likely passed before he fucked it up.

I don't know about bullshit news, but if you want to see a narrative pushed aggressively, take no further look than /r/politics. Idk mate i think TD takes the cake for that one. Both are utter shit, but at least TD wears its bias on its sleeve.. They actively ban you for not sucking one dudes dick. Yeah, I guess at that point might as well be open about it, but you dont get props lol.. They say clearly in the rules that they're for Trump supporters only and the subreddit is called the_donald. How is it not clear that the sub is not meant for bipartisan discussion?. It is perfectly clear. One is a fan club, the other is a place for political discussion with a bias against (though not unjustifiably) the current administration.. Well for a sub intended for general political discussion, they're insanely biased.. It's biased because the users a predominately from on political spectrum. You don't get banned for a dissenting opinion though.

Trump loves spreading fake news.. Didn't Trudeau literally tweet fake news about the hijab scissor girl, and never retract it?. No. He expressed sympathy. Turns out the sympathy was unwarranted, and probably should be quietly retracted, but that's a pretty far cry from tweeting the fake news itself.. Why should it be quietly retracted?. Because it's not a big deal, and should be treated accordingly.. He made it a huge deal, yelling from the rooftops about this lie, so his retraction should reach just as many ears. I only know about the one tweet. How, exactly, did he make it a huge deal?. https://youtu.be/FSx25kfHKzw

Reddit is as much of a social network as a piss trough at an old baseball field..

Freedom of speech doesnt mean access to Facebook. . Yes it does.. In what world?. In the world where freedom of speech means allowing people to communicate ideas you disagree without interference of the state.  What world do you operate in?. One where facebook is not a right.

Lobbying is a group of people pooling their money together to communicate with lawmakers. . Bribery is not equivalent to free speech. . Bribery is already illegal. Lobbying is not bribery.. Lobbying is effectively a form of bribery.   Especially when you can say Do things favorable to my business or Ill donate a ton of money to your primary competitor who will play ball.. You could also be a constituent and say if you're not going to implement policy x, I'm going to donate to your opponent. Should that be illegal? . Constituents, outside of the aptly named Donor class dont have anywhere near the influencing/purchasing power. . So it's a matter of scale? What about an NGO that argues for gay rights? It runs off of donations, should they be able to say If you don't support gay marriage, we will fund your opposition?. We might be oversimplifying the issue, but yes?  In the end, lobbying itself isnt the issue - at its core, its campaign finance laws that are the issue.

t3_811e2p	0	*	Canada Makes National Parks Permanently Free For Kids. Why wouldnt national parks be free in the first place? Do tax payers not largely pay for it or am i mistaken?. we pay for taxes but the parks aren't allocated enough funding to keep up with maintenance for the amount of traffic, both Canadian and international tourist, they see annually.. why?   National parks here are free.. The US has the largest and most diverse National Park system in the world. Wed like to keep it that way. . Australia has much the same land mass and our parks are free.  Why aren't yours?. Because those who actually use the parks should pay more of the cost rather than say someone who lives in Iowa who might never visit a national park . Yeah you're right. Fuck tourism, it doesn't bring in that much revenue anyway.. I assure you that the national parks do not lack for visitors even with an entrance fee. Then why do they need an entrance fee? You and visitors though tourism already covered that in taxation. Why are you paying twice?

That keeps bitcoin from crashing in value. Getting value out of bitcoin diminishes it's value? . Yes, because of the concept of supply and demand.. bitcoin has a fixed, finite supply.. There is also a finite number of poos I am going to make in my lifetime. Doesn't make them valuable.. I don't need to know why, but if someone is willing to give me something else in return for my poop, then that makes my poop valuable. I will pay for your shitcoin if you pay for mine.

The South refuse if the North also want to retain their head of state.  It's an impasse. . Short term won't work either because of the implication.. They can't refuse..

That freedom of speech crap you have over there - it's inconvenient to me, I don't believe in it, and we're working on getting rid of it.  You'd better do the same.. US has better freedom of speech than we do in the UK. They're very similar I'd say. Though hate speech is tolerated less in the UK. . The term hate speech drives me nuts. It's so subjective, impossible to properly define, and a giant gateway to mass censorship hiding under the thin veil of protecting people's feelings.. Can you name a case of legitimate speech that was blocked because it was called hate speech?. People in the U.K. have been arrested for burning the Quran. Why does anyone need to burn a Quran other than to send a message of hate to Muslims? I personally hate Christians, but I don't go around burning the New Testament.. Why is it any of your business what I do with my own Quran? That you don't like behaviour doesn't mean you can violently force me not to do it.. Most Quran burners are idiotic Christian nut pots. They need to be shut the fuck up because they are worse than the Muslims.

If you have a look at the West right now there is no leader but a bunch of children measuring dicks while the rest of the world leverages on it.. Regardless he is the leader if germany decides we need a WW3 and go full blown nazi again the US would be stuck with knocking some sense into them.. At the moment it is in the US, not in Germany, that you see Nazi flags on the streets.. Because germany made it a crime. In the US even the dumbest ideas are still legal.

Its not illegal just not socially acceptable. Plus we can talk to coppers like humans and not like kids talk to headmasters.. Bullshit it isn't illegal.

If tweets are enough to topple a democracy then democracy is clearly not the best government type . Propaganda works under any form of government. . Yeah but with Democracy the people who are influenced the easiest by it get to vote.   If tweets are enough to topple a democracy then I don't see any value in democracy itself. Fair enough.

That 300,000 Americans didn't have a strong enough opinion about Hillary or Trump already that some tweets changed their minds? . I don't know, your constant, combative, dismissive appeal to ridicule is *pretty* convincing..

It's been several months already and he hasn't been called out at all. I highly doubt anything will happen. But I'd love to be proven wrong.. Are you still ignoring the sanctions that Congress passed a law and Trump signed, but still refusing to act upon? Something will happen.. Why didn't it happen immediately? He blatantly ignored the sanctions and there were no reprocussions. That's why I'm negative that anything will happen to him.

Also not true, most of China is in my home city Heidelberg clogging up all streets in the old town and buying cheap plastic imitation beer steins that also come from China.

No, because having strong national defense doesn't require authoritarianism.

I don't know why we still don't use them.. They still sell them, I dont know why we do t use them either.   We used pasta as kids in the 80s. Bucatini was always in our house anyway and made great straws. . I can't find any Bucatini that's big enough for it. Last I got had such a small hole in the center I couldn't even move air through it.. Yeah, its gotta be the big ones. Years ago, I went to the 1700s themed restaurant at Greenfield Village in Dearborn and was tickled because their straws were the big bucatini pasta. . Any idea where to get them?  Also that's cool, since I live right near there.

Ignoring things such as links to violence, it harms the economy by stifling entrepreneurship. . Wealth is not zero sum. Me owning a $250k house does make me 250k wealthier, but does not make you 250k poorer. Same with other assets like stocks etc.... And with real estate? Is there an unlimited amount of land to own? Your owning a house on land certainly means there's less land for other people to put up houses. . And be buying Boeing stock means you can't buy those shares. Doesn't make you poorer. And yet increased concentration of wealth has corresponded with decreased public ownership of stocks... Correlation is not causation. . Sometimes it is.

They throw the most fabulous parties I've ever been to and are some of the nicest, funniest people I've ever met.. Straight people can be funny, nice, stylish and throw good parties too. Homosexuality isn't a spray that makes you a better person, its a sexual orientation.. Sure but for some reason gay people act like thats their calling card. They are gay first, then a human. . Separating a group from the normal people is exactly what is required to justify every bit of irrational homophobic, racist and sexist attitudes that exists. . How does that make sense? Being gay isn't *normal*. Literally. It's not the norm. There's nothing wrong with it, but it isn't normal by the very definition of the word.. > Being gay isn't normal  No. It's normal for a percentage of the population to be homosexual.

They will be enforced regardless by the federal, military, and international bodies responsible.. bull fucking shit and even you republicans know that is a lie. Why hasn't he implemented the sanctions he signed in August last year?. I just said because he's not the one directly implementing. It is various agencies and military departments that are responsible for the direct implementation, not the Office of the President.. and he hasn't started the process to do that because his master in Russia would get at him.. How would you know? Have been keeping up with the implementation and the effects the sanctions have been having?. It's not hard to get all the info on internet. The POTUS and his admin need to implements in order sanctions to work. You think POTUS jobs just signs shit and go to golf?. What? I asked you a question and you gave me a non answer. Why?

I'd support military training requirements as a prerequisite for private firearm ownership. no, after 2 hours of instruction targeted at the lowest common denominator. . Significantly (infinitely) more than is required of a private citizen. . Not true.. How so? I have never been required to participate in any firearm safety training, with the exception of a short video at a range (but of course that wasnt required to purchase the firearms). .

IP (Intellectual Property) provisions are suspended.  Investor-state dispute settlement was kinda dismantled.  More worker rights.  More environmental protections.. ISDS is definately still in there.   Worker & enviromental rights have been watered down to appease developping countries, as have IP provisions.   So yeah you're basically right for the most part.. Tip: there is a **finite** number of ways to spell de**finite**ly.. Tip: There **are** a finite number of ways to correct someone's spelling and grammar.. Interesting, I don't know who is right here.. Me neither! I've flipped back and forth on this forever. Is the sentence more about how there are ways or how there is a number?. There are ways. Is the basis of the sentence. Subject-verb agreement makes it 'are'. 'Number' is modifying 'ways' but is not itself the subject. Oh boy, grammar fun times!

No but being a right wing reactionary is.. Youre political parties entire agenda is literally stop blumpf from doing things.

If only movie science worked. spaceship with blackhole engine. trust me on this. I'm sorry, but any unseasoned plan for faster than light space travel just isn't going to work..

That would never work anyways! Gullible much? . He most certainly did! He talked about it in a debate.   Plus, you can actually read about it.  https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/Pay_for_the_Wall.pdf. Why ask Congress for the money if Mexico is paying got it? . The wall needs to get built now. Dealing with Mexico to cover the cost will take time. This is how things get done in the real world. . Wow gullible! You realize more Mexicans left when obama was president than cane in? Darn facts. http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/. I dont care about those numbers. What matters is he amount here and that they are coming across. 
t3_7omidx	1	*	Trump claims Mexico will pay for wall  day after seeking $18bn from Congress. > I believe Mexico will pay for the wall, I have a very good relationship with Mexico. But yes, in some form, Mexico will pay for the wall.  This fucking guy. I have good relationship with Mexico! That's why they're okay with me building a wall!. Its so sad right? His logic is something else. . Logic? LOGIC?. Yea he knows what he wants to know. Nothing more. Have you read the new book that just came out? Thats what it says in there. . How do you know something that you don't know?. Those are known unknowns. What we need to worry about are the unknown unknowns.. That quote does make sense in its original context.. As much as I don't like Rumsfeld, he was right when he said it.
t3_7omidx	1	*	Trump claims Mexico will pay for wall  day after seeking $18bn from Congress. I wonder whos more retarded the orange piece of shit or the inbred idiots that support him lol this retarded world goes to shits . I'm going to go with the people who lost to a retarded piece of shit. Well Hillary won by 3 million votes and she was retarded (granted a little bit less so)   I think your argument failed a little bit. If she won then how come Trump is in the White House?  Or was no one in her camp aware that the electoral college counts more than the popular vote?. >If she won then how come Trump is in the White House?  He just told you.  . Sounds more to me like she didnt win, or else shed be in the White House #factsfirst. Hillary Clinton received 3 million more votes than Trump. #factsfirst. Electoral college counts more than the popular vote.  These rules were written a long time ago, they did not suddenly change in 2016. #realnews #comeupwithyourownhashtagsinsteadofapingminepls. No shit Sherlock, I never implied otherwise.  Trump was the least popular candidate in the 2016 Election, and the majority of Americans continue to disapprove of him. #factsfirst #realnews

If he keeps saying it, his supporters will believe it. . Then let his supporters pay for the damn wall. . But Mexico is doing that! And their taxes are getting lower, definitely not higher like they would be if they were paying right? That's what he said, right?. He also claimed that he is a genius and that he has a perfect memory. . God dammit. He and Jong-un are made for each other. Jong-Un actually knows everything is a front and knows his own limitations. He's much better at being a statesman than Trump, there's no point to compare between the two.. This truth hurts.. It really is true. Kim Jong-Un is a smart dictator who knows how to keep his country wrapped around his finger. Trump is just an idiot.. they somehow developed nuclear weapons while under the strictest sanctions known to man

Does anyone actually think it'll succeed?. This is his idea of 'leverage.'  He's gonna be shocked when the Democrats throw it back in his face and tell him to go fuck himself 'and' his wall.  . So the Democrats are going to abandon their dreamers over a wall? LOL. Sure thats going to play well in November. . I'm sorry, but the Democratic Party does not negotiate with terrorists.  When we take the Congress back, we'll fix the Dreamer situation, but Donnie can take his wall and shove it up his fat ass.  . If the democrats don't give the funding for the wall then DACA will be terminated before the 2018 mid term elections and your beautiful dreamers will have to go back to Mexico and El Salvador!. Its cute , thanks for sending back mostly skilled and educated workers back home to improve their economy.   trump is a genius.. That would really be nice!

So does that mean we get that iranian hostage money back? Or maybe those 6 really bad guys for one lousy deserter? . Iranian thing?  bro, it was REAGAN that cut the back-alley deal with the Iranians to have the hostages released after he got elected.  You need to bone up on your history.. I think he was talking about the 2016 hostage incident not the 1980s ones. You know the one that happened days before the iran deal was solidified?

The white population made sure to eradicate the native populations, subjugate them, and destroy their cultures. Says someone who clearly knows nothing about New Zealand..

Just emigrate to Canada and apply for citizenship. Then you can access this 3 for 1 deal.. Unless youre a skilled migrant it isnt actually easy for an American to become a Canadian citizen. . Canada regards America the same way America regards Mexico. Except the flow of talented people is definitely southward... SV, LA, NYC are full of Canadians.. There are more americans working in canada on visas then the reverse. So this simply isn't true. . The US population is 10x higher...   The rate of Canadians leaving for the US > the rate of Americans leaving for Canada. And you said the flow of people is southward which is not true. Also Illegal US to Canada border crossings are at an all time high. . Those illegals are Haitian refugees who heard the news that they might be sent back to Haiti.

She isnt involved in most peoples lives unless youre singing the anthem everyday or are military. In Greys words shes more like a declawed kitten compared to royals past.. She's not even in the Canadian national anthem either. Technically Canada has 2 national anthems. What's the second one?. God save the Queen

How is that position not oppression?

(eagerly awaiting downvotes and autism). You should tell Trumps son in law that because he already admitted to collusion.. OH NOES HE COMMITTED A COLLUSIONS.  ... you don't even know what that means, because if you did you'd know it wasn't illegal and that you need to stop watching so much CNN.. I know it's not illegal, asshole. Covering up a conspiracy and obstruction of justice is illegal.. Does tinfoil cause balding?. I understand this isn't covered by Fox News or Breitbart but, Mueller is building a obstruction of justice case.. I hope he brings back Elvis too.. Trumps own White House counsel thinks he guilty of obstruction, lol.  His own hired staff.. Oh I'm sure CNN reported that. And I'm sure the Russians made McCabe step down too?  You're so deep in the propaganda that you don't even know it.

Not doubting you but whats your source for that?. Not gonna provide on. It can be googled and I just left a comment lol.. So youre bullshitting? . Literally just google it. Not hard.. I fee like every time I read it in a comment section just google it its just an OP trying to weasel out of admitting he doesnt have a source.  .

Haha, extra judicial killings completely outside the rule of international law are so wacky and hilarious. Lawl. . I mean so are illegal settlements and colonization but Israeli government and society dont seem to mind. Do you really think there isn't a huge social conflict here about the settlements?. You all always like arguing with each other.  It does not change the result: poor weak Palestinians get f'd over.  Israel won this war decades ago but it does not want peace for its enemies.. Don't act like the Palestinians are just sitting there waiting for Israel to allow them to have peace. They're constantly egging Israel on.. all the power is in Israel's hands.  It can have peace if it wants.. How do you figure? What options do they have? If peace were so simple that a random redditor could figure it out it would've been done by now. There would have been peace by now if Israel wanted peace.  Israel does not want peace.. Please, continue to make vague statements without a single attempt an a logical argument to back them.

And also that, so long as the danger is just to yourself, doing something unsafe shouldn't be illegal.  For instance, it's not illegal to cut your own arm off.

Especially if you had gallows set up beforehand like this social rejects did.. You mean like Obama protestors did once upon a time?   EDIT: Clarification, protests against Obama.. Probably. Didn't pay as much attention back then.. They literally had a doll of Obama hangling from gallows. Some had a doll of him hanging and on fire. Some made corny jokes of nooses towards him like Hang in there Obama and a drawing of a noose.. People have done the same stupid shit with trump (see that one chick who went viral for a day or whatever making the rest of the anti trump crowd look nuts). Just idiots everywhere . And they bitch when someone doesnt respect the orange freak. How typical of right wing filth.. u took my point and ran somewhere else with it, but I guess it is wrong to point out issues on our own side as well. Wouldnt want the opposition to run out of ammunition for sure . well i didn't mean to refer to your comment when i replied but big deal one chick vs the horde of right wing unwashed filth that did the noose thing on Obama for years.

t3_7sr0r2	1	*	North Korea calls for reunification with South Korea. wat.  ^^^Edit: ^^^wtf. The only reason there is two Koreas right now is because the US and Russia just can't be friends.  EDIT: read a history book . Your comment is completely naive and ignores nearly 70 years of dictatorship. . Korea was one country until 1945 when the Russians and US divided it. My comment is historically accurate. . The Russians and the US also divided Germany.  Somehow that was able to get worked out.  Think there might be a few additional details at play in Korea?. Yeah, Germany doesn't physically border Russia. . Yet the KGB, including Putin, had an office in East Germany.  Plenty of Russian interest in a divided Germany despite your simpleton assessment that a physical border is somehow relevant.. You think US troops on the north of the peninsula isn't a huge factor in this to China and Russia? . Good to see youve acknowledged theres more to North Korea than a frosty US-Russia relationship.

Oh, the guy's math was so off that I misunderstood his statement and thought he was just talking about the theft.  $534m - $423m = >50m. To wash the money they need to convert it and go through some exchanges that take percentages. They'll end up with 50-70 left.. Says the guy whose headmath is in question... ;).

They havent always said we wont attack unless attacked, and they havent had the capabilities they supposedly have now.. When have they said they'll attack without provocation?. Type in North Korea threatens and then a random year into google.  Odds are you would have selected a year thy threatened to attack.  Again you people are fucked in the head.  . And yet they never have, almost like they are simply threats.  And no I don't support NK, just pointing out that NK doesn't want to become a nuclear crater. . So you admit your original comment was pointless?  If they get attacked it wont be a nuclear strike.

Well it's expected that you'll take a student loan for that . Yeah, which is a shame. An education shouldn't come with debt, at least the first time you go through it anyway.. Uk student loans are not debt, like in the US.. UK student loans need to be repaid once you start earning over a certain amount annually. This is still a debt as it still needs repaying.. The terms are so favourable that I would take out 1000 student loans if I could keep the money. If I could keep the money. You can't though. It's a loan. Therefore a debt.

t3_7uhi3d	0	*	Zimbabwe to give white farmers 99-year leases, like black counterparts, after new President Emmerson Mnangagwa said he would end discrimination along racial lines in agriculture.. This is a tough one for some people to wrap their heads around: the white people all left, and *then* the problems started happening. I believe that is the first time that happened in Africa.. Evil government drives farmers off their land and then people starve.  Tale as old as time, the twist is this time its a government doing it to their own farmers. You mean like every communist country in history? What a twist is that? Subverting expectations?. Thank good communists dont do that. only the comunists. Which i assume are some radical catholic ideology.. What?. He edited his comment.  it used to say comunists, not communists. And i made a catholic joke, and now it's gone.. Ah. Not really sure how Catholicism ties in, but okay.. Communion, which today i learned is spelled with 2 m's and not one. Damn i am a pretty bad catholic.. It's okay, we all make mistakes.  For your penance, you must comment five Our Fathers, and send a PM to God asking for guidance.

Our Constitution is living and breathing.  It's time for America to live and breathe too with Trump as our unified leader.. /s?. The Constitution was written 300 years ago, so it has to be interpreted under the lens of today.. TIL its the year 2089. Approximately 300 years, in 4 different centuries.. Why not say roughly 1000 years in two different millenniums? . People's frame of reference doesn't usually cover that period.  The last 300-400 years has a deep meaning to people in the US..

It's not for one person to take up the whole bench and deny access to others. . Students on campus here sleep on the benches every day all the time in summer. Should we ban them from doing so?. Students on campus, they are where they are supposed to be. People in public, they are where they are supposed to be.. This is why I lie across all the seats on the bus. It's called public transport for a reason. You want a seat, get a car.. You have to pay for a seat on the bus. I don't recall there being any paid public benches.. So now it's not about it being public, it's about it being a free service?  This is why I go up to free sample stalls and eat everything. You want a sample, get here earlier.

So you lose access to benches when you lose your job?. They arent losing access to benches.. True, but they are losing the ability to sleep on benches (easily, at least).. The bars on the bench prevent everyone from sleeping on them not just the homeless. People with homes generally sleep in their homes.. Right, but they have not lost the ability to sit on them like everyone else.

Not a chance in hell I'd buy a used GPU that was possibly used for mining unless it was less than half of MSRP.. not that different from buying it from a nerd who played pubg 18 hours a day.

t3_7x8ad0	0	*	Israel is boycotting a film festival in Paris which plans to screen Foxtrot, an acclaimed drama which depicts the Israeli army covering up the deaths of Palestinian teenagers.. Both Israel and Palestine are problems. Clearly Israel doesn't want to admit their wrong doings. . No one wants to. Unfortunately. Our country picks Israel's side. It's stupid. One day they'll drag us into their conflict more than we already are.. I was thinking more like everyone has fault in this conflict and i wouldnt judge the US for supporting a country thats conpletly surrounded by other hostile countries. I'd rather stay out of it and let them blow each other off the face of the Earth. . Thats one way to see it but id rather not have multiple countries kill each other. Me neither, but you know violence is the only thing on some peoples' minds, especially in the uncivilized countries.. I wouldnt call israel uncivilized but youre kinda right. I would say they're a little more civilized than Palestine. Palestine pretty much promotes religious and political genocide.

Didnt america fund the taliban in the 1970s?. The Taliban did not exist in the 70s. sorry i meant the mujahideen . The mujahadeen was a resistance group fighting the Soviet union for invading Afghanistan. They were not terrorists. They were a politically motivated group that carried out violent attacks what would u call that? Oh right terrorists.. They were a rebellion against the Soviet occupation . They were terrorists that we helped.   Also, by your logic ISIS is not a terrorist group but a large scale rebellion. . ISIS are terrorists the trail of death of innocents and destruction makes them terrorists. The mujahadeen were fighting to free Afghanistan from soviets

I'd believe that if they weren't fighting against requiring mandatory gun safety classes as a condition of ownership . What would that accomplish though?. It would effectively ban poor people from owning guns legally.. If you can't spend the $50 on a class, i don't think you can actually afford a gun..

This is why Russia lovers in online comments always say any conflict between the US and Russia would be nuclear.

The Russian military is strong enough to have NATO collectively shit itself back when Donald Trump kept talking about revising USA's commitments to the alliance.. The Russian CONVENTIONAL military evokes absolutely no fear. Any fear stems solely from the probability of conventional fighting degeneration into unconventional warfare.. Russian military is still in top 3 at worse like it or not. Top 3 or not, doesn't matter, everyone's fucked regardless if it comes down to size actually mattering . It does matter, someone have to protect and operate those nukes and borders . I meant more of in case of full fledged war, you don't need a massive army to drop a bunch of nukes and just completely fuck the entire world up . Not everyone have nukes and they aren't always required... Russia didn't glass Georgia nor didn't US glass Iraq as examples . Georgia and iraq as bad as they were were playground fun compared to the possibility of a ww3

You might not agree with them but surely you can see why they might feel like that?. The animals that are being hunted are old/sick and would be killed anyway.. If the animals are old/sick and would die anyway, why not just let them die naturally? . Because they can be a danger to the other animals. They can be more aggressive and start attacking other animals.. And this way the park gets a lot of money to keep doing park things.

Germany is doing great things and I like it. . They use a lot of coal power plants, 40%+ of electricity comes from coal.  Renewable sources do not really replace coal but rather nuclear.. Still an impressive ramp-up.. Yes, but it is largely neutral on emissions since it seems to mostly replace nuclear.  The most important is to reduce emissions.. Yeah its just a good headline, but dose nothing for emissions . If it makes renewables cheaper and helps renewable companies/industry compete more with coal it definitely does. . But the point is they could've replaced coal with renewables and kept their nuclear. That would be much cleaner assuming no nuclear plant accidents.. Even assuming accidents, nuclear power would be much cleaner. Statistically it evens out. Just goes to show how bad coal really is.. So what you're saying is that it wouldn't be cleaner.

This should be big news for the sake of public influence for justice. . Instead, very soon this poor sod will likely show up with a clear case of heart attack. Inside of a sports bag.. Naw he will suicide himself with 2 gun shot wounds to the back of the head.. Side note: back of the head part aside, two-shot suicides are not at all uncommon...... Could you elaborate on how that is possible? Genuinely cant wrap my head around the idea. Not am expert but you don't die instantly to a gunshot usually so you would definitely have time to gert two shots off with a semi auto weapon. Use a shotgun. . Or put that shotgun [into a helmet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/2rzvz2/til_that_40_years_ago_a_boy_constructed_a_suicide/). cool story bro
t3_7vu06r	0	*	Iran executed 3 children in January. 1st kid, not problem, sicko who prob wasn't going to be reformed..other 2, gray areas not enough detail, but didn't warrant execution either . Totally agree. I don't know how anyone could defend these scum, especially the first one.. The girl who was married at 13 to some old pervert fuck. He probably raped her many times over the 4 years. She is scum?. Don't know the details, and barbaric as their culture might be, what do you expect, to just let her loose after murdering someone?. > what do you expect, to just let her loose after murdering someone?  Well, yes, it was self defense.. By your reasoning, many, maybe most Iranian men deserve to be exterminated.. No, only by your warped misunderstanding on what is self-defense.. How do you know it's self defense, it's not mentioned in the article? And if arranged marriage constitutes reason for murder, then by your reasoning Iranians should be exterminated.. Damn, you reaching real hard all over this thread to troll.  STEP IT UP BRO
t3_7xvezl	0	*	Japan, the United States and the European Union are considering jointly filing a case against China at the World Trade Organization over Chinese rules that effectively force foreign companies to transfer technologies to domestic firms, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.. I'm all for free market and China selling their shit everywhere.  China totally needs to cut this shit out if they want free trade. This is total bullcrap.. Yep, if China wants unrestricted access to western markets they should also let western companies have unrestricted access to their own.. China doesn't have unrestricted access to Western markets.. Then they should also file cases with the WTO against western markets that they believe they should be allowed to have greater access to.. That takes too long. Might take years. Bullshit.. Well is the west can go through this long process to be treated fairly then so can China.. But China doesn't require the West to go through that process, so why would China have to?. Well apparently it does, the West is literally having to go through the WTO to get back on even terms, did you even read the article?. China doesn't want the West to go through that process. The West is doing that on its own.
